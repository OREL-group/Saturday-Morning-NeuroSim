## TRANSCRIPT  
0:00     
hello morning hello hi uh so welcome     
0:08     
um so this week we had a diva one meeting and we had a continuation of the     
0:16     
discussion on graph neural networks and graph hyper or     
0:22     
hyperraph representations of development so we've been working on that for the     
0:28     
last two weeks uh working through a paper talking about     
0:33     
different ways that people do this so it's a nice little literature review that we're working through and uh     
0:40     
discussing ways to map biology to that because the review itself is about     
0:46     
hyperraph methods but just kind of working through how you might apply that     
0:51     
say like to some other model organism or     
0:56     
model system so that's been going on in the divor group and that those meetings     
1:03     
are available on the divor channel on     
1:08     
YouTube uh so the other thing is is that we are     
1:14     
starting up our open source meetings probably the second Friday in     
1:19     
May i think that's May 9th and so that's going to     
1:25     
come start up then so if you're not familiar with the open room or I'm sorry     
1:32     
the open source meetings that we have um those are usually you know we have our     
1:40     
at that point we'll have newly selected GOC students we'll have other people of     
1:46     
interest we'll talk about different topics in open source it'll be an     
1:51     
opportunity for people to give an update on their projects So they'll have their projects     
1:59     
um they'll be starting their projects every week they're required to give an update and then we'll have people maybe     
2:06     
if you're you know other people are interested in joining us uh giving their updates on different     
2:13     
projects and then we usually have a feature which is either project management     
2:19     
related professional development related or something to do with open     
2:25     
source and so years past we have these meetings uh from the years past on     
2:30     
YouTube so if you look up open source interest group or some variation of that     
2:36     
you'll get a playlist that shows all the videos from I think the last two years we've been     
2:42     
doing so we'll have that uh for people to look at as a template     
2:50     
so it starts May 9th um and it'll be at noon on Fridays     
2:59     
uh Eastern time so usually is Eastern time as a     
3:04     
marker eastern time North America so plan     
3:12     
accordingly okay so did we want to give any updates at     
3:18     
this point or we hope we can wait     
3:25     
i'm here in San Diego for the California Neurochnology Conference     
3:32     
this is a student event by all the um neuroch student     
3:40     
clubs in California well a large     
3:46     
majority of them so a lot of UC schools together with uh USC     
3:53     
okay I believe are the the hosts i think more schools might     
3:59     
be attending um so apologies but I I will be switching     
4:06     
over to my phone at some point just because I think checkin is at 8 8 a.m     
4:13     
okay yeah so but     
4:20     
um just trying to think of if there's you know there's some good     
4:26     
stuff in um network mirror science or I I was     
4:31     
kind of wondering if you've seen um what was it called     
4:37     
um Zap but     
4:51     
that bench oh okay no I hadn't but we can take a look     
4:56     
at that later yeah and and um and of course as usual there was also     
5:04     
a great you know some some great content from the     
5:13     
ICTS um so in in that     
5:19     
same channel there's some YouTube links that just say live um but uh hopefully     
5:27     
they'll have switched it up at some point um but the but the meeting the     
5:34     
discussion meeting link there has more about the uh actual content uh I mean if     
5:41     
you click on them you'll you'll see some some good stuff but just just referring to a a lot of um you know work trying to     
5:50     
infer dynamical systems from like physiology data     
6:01     
and then of course Michael some good stuff     
6:11     
yeah I'll have to take a look at that we'll take a look at that channel in a little bit um yeah so thanks Morgan     
6:19     
um need he have you you have any updates or     
6:26     
no just pap going on alongside     
6:40     
That's good yeah and and you've been putting some good papers in the Slack so thank     
6:46     
you for that um     
6:53     
Yeah all right so let's get started so um first thing I wanted to point to a     
6:59     
couple weeks ago Jesse uh talked about a group uh     
7:05     
called Echolapto and it's a group of people i don't know uh how they're structured i     
7:13     
know that there's some people uh involved from u a couple of different     
7:19     
universities and it's basically sort of a cognitive science type uh     
7:24     
interdisciplinary group so I think they've had like a recent hackathon and they're doing some interesting things     
7:30     
there so I ran across I ran across this blog post uh     
7:37     
they have a substack called echolopto and they have this uh blog     
7:45     
post what has echolapto so echolapto likes to think deeply about the symbol of mundane this     
7:52     
is echolopto Daniel vanzant and Dan Elton van Elton is     
7:57     
someone who Jesse knows personally so science and     
8:05     
technology advocate critic Daniel Vanzant is a AI and     
8:12     
neuroscience writer and a meta science writer so they're going to talk about this     
8:19     
initiative so at Echalopto and it's a group there they have their videos on YouTube you can look up Echolapto on     
8:26     
YouTube and they have the videos there and they have their like you know they they're kind of structured like us they     
8:32     
have their meetings and they have their events uh that are open like that um at EOPA we     
8:40     
are highly multidiscipline so not interdicciplinary but multiddisipline technically there's a     
8:47     
difference whereas interdisciplinary is talking between     
8:52     
disciplines multiddisiplinary is working across disciplines and we don't really     
8:59     
use the term multiddisciplinary in this group but we're kind of more of that I would say     
9:05     
rather than interdisciplinary although we do both um so they're multi-isipline iplinary in     
9:14     
that they research and talk about physics mathematics computer science     
9:22     
neuroscience biology medicine and meta science that's a lot but basically um     
9:28     
you know whatever it takes I guess understand the brain uh because I think that's their focus is neuroscience and     
9:36     
the brain because they kind of overlap in a number of ways     
9:42     
there is an overarching theme to a lot of echolop's work however understanding and enhancing cognitive systems is the     
9:51     
sort of the main thrust so cognitive systems involves neural brain but it also involves     
9:59     
thinking and behavior and so that's also part of their mission     
10:05     
this post describes a framework we developed that ties together Echolapo's diverse research activities so this is     
10:12     
just kind of talking about that framework uh people have been trying to hack their brains since the first humans     
10:19     
ate a suspicious mushroom today we're doing the same thing but with better     
10:24     
tools and fancier words echolopto digs into this age-old quest from many angles     
10:30     
encouraging wild thinking while remaining grounded by careful scientific testing recent recently we realized that     
10:37     
Echolapto's research activities will be clustered into four quadrants along two     
10:43     
dimensions so this is the graph I'm going to show you in a bit and it kind of talks about this this sort of space     
10:49     
that they're in internal modification versus external     
10:55     
extension and pure science versus application so they're thinking in terms     
11:02     
of like when they say extension they mean like extending uh from the brain uh and     
11:10     
from the body so modifying the body you know versus extended cognition I guess     
11:18     
and then the role sort of the area of science that they're working in so either they're working in pure science     
11:24     
which is hypothetical deductive science um you know answering     
11:31     
questions not thinking about the applications much at all versus     
11:36     
application which is always thinking about the applications how it applies in the real world internal modification     
11:43     
focuses on changing existing cognitive processes while external extension     
11:49     
involves augmenting them with external tools here science seeks     
11:55     
understanding application puts that understanding practical use so this is the figure here or internal     
12:02     
modification to external extension that's the axis on the     
12:08     
horizontal and then insight which is pure science versus application that's     
12:14     
on the axis along the vertical and so you can see that there are these four     
12:21     
they form these four quadrants in the first quadrant which is internal modification and     
12:27     
insight we have a question and that is what does this modification     
12:33     
slashpractice reveal about the mind so this is where you know we have like     
12:39     
maybe some modification of a system we like intervene in it     
12:44     
somehow or we have maybe a modification of the brain or the body and then maybe     
12:51     
we have a practice like you know a cultural practice or a scientific     
12:57     
practice and then those reveal something about the mind and you know I think it's     
13:02     
probably one of these things where they're doing formal investigations but they're also doing kind of like     
13:09     
self-reflection as well so it's very broad in terms of how you ask this     
13:15     
question and then uh next over external extension and     
13:22     
insight or pure science that quadrant is     
13:27     
question what does X extension imply for cognition     
13:32     
so if you extend something uh there's some implication for     
13:39     
cognition and so you know it might be like an enhancement of cognition or it     
13:45     
might be some sort of extension of an idea and so that's the idea there uh and     
13:52     
there's some implication for cognition always and maybe there isn't but we want     
13:58     
to know uh what the effect is and what the effect size is     
14:04     
um internal modification and application together yields the     
14:09     
question what modification slpractices allow people to think with     
14:17     
so this is where you know you have again these modifications and     
14:22     
practices and instead of saying that they reveal something about the mind they actually allow people to think     
14:30     
perhaps so this is just the application domain where you know you want to know     
14:37     
if say I put a a brain computer interface     
14:42     
on what does it allow me to do versus if I put some     
14:48     
electrodes on my on my head or in my brain what does it reveal about     
14:58     
uh then external extension and application together fields the following     
15:03     
question what extensions would allow people to think better so how could we     
15:09     
get people to think better what you know what and concretely would make that happen     
15:17     
it could be like you know something as simple as a monomic or it could be you know a like a     
15:26     
tool computational tool with a program or you know something like that or it     
15:33     
could be some sort of brain machine interface or it could be some sort of     
15:39     
training or educational intervention so that's what they're getting at here and it's very broad because I think the     
15:45     
initiative is very broad so this is uh they kind of go through these quadrants here um internal     
15:53     
modification pure science examines how internal manipulations the brain reveal     
15:59     
fundamental principles about how the mind works these changes can be brought about     
16:05     
by either molecules or behavioral change example quantifying the effects of sleep     
16:11     
deprivation on her so you have their question or a statement you have a set     
16:17     
of hypotheses and you can actually test those and get a sense of uh how that     
16:23     
that tells you about how the mind works um internal modification     
16:30     
application is concerned with designing internal manipulations to improve cognitive capabilities so this would     
16:38     
might be like something like psychedelics enhancing creativity fasting to enhance     
16:45     
learning or meditation to enhance it so external extension/pure science uses     
16:54     
artificial systems and tools to better understand the cognition by creating technological     
17:00     
analoges of mental processes so this might be where we want to     
17:06     
understand how large language models work and the relation then between     
17:11     
language intelligence so getting a handle on those artificial     
17:18     
analoges and then seeing what they tell us about language and intelligence     
17:25     
um finally external extension application creates technologies that     
17:31     
expand human cognitive capabilities beyond their natural limits     
17:36     
and memory aids reasoning tools so for example a using AI to enhance scientific     
17:43     
research wearable devices to enhance memory computer interfaces to enhance     
17:50     
new sensory modalities that's how they're thinking about     
17:55     
this uh Echolapto 8 aims to explore wild new ideas across these frontiers while     
18:02     
maintaining scientific rigor the stakes are high we're talking about fundamental     
18:07     
human capabilities which would create autocatalytic feedback loops that change     
18:13     
the future of humanity so they kind of have this uh this uh cybernetic aim as well which     
18:22     
is you know part of that process of thinking and creating     
18:28     
knowledge if you're fascinated by these possibilities you're willing to think beyond conventional boundaries while     
18:35     
keeping your feet planted in the solid science we're your kind of people the human mind remains the most interesting     
18:42     
and important piece of matter in the universe understanding and enhancing it requires     
18:47     
both world speculation and careful analysis so it's uh     
18:55     
their bit about echolop it looks like Jesse's here so     
19:01     
just in time for Jesse to join in um so how are you okay i I missed the     
19:11     
intro to uh how we got to talking about the group     
19:17     
but it's nice it's good to see the     
19:24     
discussion so yeah it was I just I mean I just started with that blog post they     
19:29     
had a with their medium and I wanted to go with this i don't know if you saw the     
19:36     
diagram yeah okay so yeah um Yeah so why don't you give an update yeah     
19:43     
yeah um I mean on echalapto or other things specifically uh anything okay     
19:51     
yeah i mean echalop is an interesting group um there's there's some absolute overlap     
19:59     
with what cognition teachers has done and we've done in the lab but     
20:06     
also there a little bit more of a biohacker bent to it um and And it's interesting because     
20:16     
um the the founder or or like the     
20:22     
main originator is AI and     
20:32     
um he's a very he's a very uh bright and curious person and I really enjoy     
20:39     
there's the sort of the salons which are a little bit more like pop up things less it's not like every meeting     
20:45     
Saturday there's just like these talks and started working to develop some of     
20:51     
his own ideas and then also um they sort of the people mentioned in that post and     
20:57     
it's been interesting experience I don't I don't think I'm an expert yet on anything but I it's been interesting to     
21:03     
see where they want to go with stuff of what they're doing     
21:09     
um as someone to I'll I'll put on sort of my     
21:16     
um I don't know a particular hat of expertise i don't know which hat it should be um it's been it's been an     
21:24     
interesting example of seeing people pursue     
21:30     
um new ideas and also you know I I think I think we're in     
21:38     
very interesting era and I think it's probably has been this way and I I defer to the older older folks here who might     
21:44     
know more history than I do about this like directly but it's a really interesting era for people to be able to     
21:50     
basically try to find like if you say you want to find and study something and     
21:57     
you have depending on what connections or networks you have you can bring people together in ways never before now     
22:03     
that just say hey I want to talk about this stuff and having funding and connection opportunities helps with     
22:10     
But you know relative to um you know what people want to look     
22:18     
into looking really looking into new things I think I think     
22:24     
uh how do I say this i think for people really looking into how to do new things     
22:31     
um it's an interesting time and and I think Echolto and Addy are really     
22:41     
um really pursuing some interesting topics and with a very interesting a very interesting set of people it um     
22:48     
because so much of the conversation matters with who you're having yeah and and being able like because you can have     
22:54     
the same conversation with people that are very beholden to certain outcomes or     
22:59     
ways things work and so on and I think one of the biggest similarities between there and here is there's a lot of     
23:07     
um you know there's in in in the in the envelope there's been musicians and     
23:14     
philosophers and people specializing in meditation and like mathematicians and physicists too like they're really     
23:20     
they're striving for the um I always throw back to like OG Macy conferences     
23:25     
um and like actually actually bringing people in the room from different specialies or backgrounds which inspired     
23:32     
I mean it happens here all the time that happens in like a lot of the set society ethics tech stuff is do that too so it's     
23:40     
it's um it's nice and and there's a lot of there's a lot being formed there I think     
23:45     
I think that's one of the first essays um that I've seen     
23:50     
where they they're trying to some of the leaders of of the group and Dan Dan Elston I've known for a while we met     
23:58     
back in like 17 or 16 or     
24:04     
yeah at a at a at a AI ethics conference um so and I mentioned a few times too     
24:11     
but it's just an interesting group and I'm really happy to be a part of them and     
24:17     
see where they go um there's there's so much I could only     
24:23     
say so much and I could I only know so much um but like they're an interesting follow for sure i know AD is working on     
24:30     
sort of um and they gave a talk last week about     
24:38     
um they're sort of developing a language or or considering like things about     
24:45     
language in general and how it relates to senses or like can you make a language based off     
24:51     
of you know things you may not normally associate with it like sensory inputs or     
24:56     
old actions smell Now um and and and kind of trying to break down these these     
25:03     
elements of what is it that um what is going into you what are these     
25:09     
frameworks or lenses or set of or whatever that come up when you're when you're trying to explore the space and     
25:16     
explor that's one of Add's um current projects in in in the in the     
25:24     
to use my frame to use my framework that I've developed in in like the Joe sense     
25:30     
that Add's project is that and there isn't there isn't really quite a     
25:35     
differentiated working group there's not like a Joe Pro working group level here's what     
25:42     
this group of people is focusing on to make this language uh come in yet but     
25:49     
it's sort of you know in the process of distilling these things that we're going to be crystized eventually working     
25:54     
through for a project um at hand it there's certainly uh people doing their     
26:00     
own thing and doing research that but it's it's it's sort of a echolapto is a much     
26:08     
um at a different developmental stage than like this lab for example this lab's like very established in its own     
26:15     
ways and things um and and like just decades of it so     
26:22     
it's different it's a different thing and it's a different process because I've been doing so much     
26:29     
writing and lately for some other things that I get into in a few moments if we have time i'm I'm I'm developing my     
26:38     
familiarity with how to communicate from these     
26:43     
vantage points of like organizational development and leadership and strategy     
26:49     
or strategy and mentorship for innovators which is one of the other things that I'm doing right now and it's     
26:56     
it's just it's interesting time to see all this happening and um you know I I     
27:01     
could see some kind of we there's some kind of a joint event at some point where we all have something and talk about stuff like like a conversation     
27:08     
about affordances um like uh as as a as an interesting tangent as     
27:15     
a segue um echolapto there's been talk in one of     
27:21     
their discussions about the brain inspired um complexity stuff I think     
27:27     
we've mentioned that here before but brain inspired I think it's Paul Middlebrook the guy     
27:34     
is leading a tour of the crackower Santa Fe Institute's complex     
27:40     
papers and he's trying to find people to talk about the papers and go through them i' I've attended a few     
27:48     
um and it's interesting but there's sort of this overlap of like complexity and     
27:54     
like these sort of um I'm a particular fan and have a I     
27:59     
don't know soft spot or admiration is a better term when people are really trying to both     
28:06     
understand old concepts and trying to make some actual new things in the world     
28:12     
like I'm very to me that's a fascinating process to and not just not just sort of make a     
28:17     
part but like push something into a     
28:23     
different degree of understanding um and that's definitely something that     
28:30     
add I think the authors of the other post are curious about too so that's     
28:36     
it's a nice thing um that's that's on that um I can update on     
28:44     
a number of other things i don't know how much time we have or else we want to come to this and interject appropriately     
28:51     
um why don't we go ahead with your updates okay um     
29:00     
uh so     
29:05     
um the easiest way or well one of the best ways to start this I suppose will     
29:12     
be kind of just framing what what's ahead there's a lot     
29:19     
that has happened and I think     
29:25     
um I think the most coherent way to communicate this right now and I might I     
29:30     
might I might share my screen in a moment i can get something set up uh but     
29:36     
in essentially uh there's two projects that well three     
29:45     
I suppose um there's two sort of job pro- driven projects that are absolutely     
29:52     
collaborations here and anybody who wants to contribute to them you're welcome to do so um and then in a big     
30:01     
inclusive sense the summer cohort and I have not written a piece about what what     
30:07     
does that mean to anybody who's watching what is what is the summer cohort you talk about summer code um     
30:14     
uh the summer cohort itself is like a whole I I kind of feel bad because I'm     
30:22     
I'm I'm I'm personally very excited that it um contains all the things it does     
30:29     
contain now but I know it's kind of a lot um but basically there's two projects     
30:37     
that I've kind of generated and they have a little bit of a backstory like I     
30:42     
I like I realize like they're literally byproduct of everything I've been through and then     
30:48     
also they're kind of spin-offs from my time at UCSD     
30:54     
um and my time as like the capstone projects that I tried to do there and     
31:00     
and some of the course work that I did there like they they they put me in     
31:05     
position to like realize a few things that was like okay it's time to do this um so those two projects are they're     
31:13     
they're sort of they're interwoven but they're quite separate like one of them is data and direction which is um     
31:21     
essentially data ethics and responsible AI focused but I want it to be out and it's a little more the tech it's the     
31:27     
it's more technical for two projects and it's it's based in data science okay but it's it's very much about     
31:35     
um ethics human centered AI respons where I um we robot people like there's     
31:42     
an event I better start sharing screen     
31:56     
um bear with me for another     
32:03     
um a moment out     
32:09     
Um hopefully you know how like you set up all this stuff and make things kind     
32:15     
of public facing and then it's time like talk about and like to see if like you're going to do the presentation and     
32:21     
the PowerPoint projected breaks it's kind of it's like I'm hoping that doesn't happen here     
32:28     
um there's things that have to come up here that are to be written and about to     
32:34     
be published here too but we're just going to release from now uh this is the like the announcement I have to update     
32:40     
on what happened but let's talk about these two things so data and direction what is it     
32:47     
um and I'm looking to sort this out a little     
32:53     
bit more but like um what it is right now it's mostly you     
33:01     
can see here like this this is the main hub of of what we have going on um     
33:09     
there's more posts to be published soon here but like it's one about you know a     
33:16     
main thing we'll be doing in this group of looking at like data tools and     
33:21     
um these things that are going on in like how how do you you know probably     
33:27     
some core aspects of of data science like yes we'll talk a little bit about cleaning data and then the basics and     
33:33     
getting the data pipeline going from your unclean data to a data product like     
33:38     
like the fundamental stuff yes but what I'm really interested in talking about um and what's what's been really cool     
33:45     
because as you notice there's al I'm um I have an intership here     
33:52     
um seeing people seeing applications so far to this uh has been very interesting     
33:59     
because for the people that get what I'm trying to do they're very appreciative of how I'm trying to set this up uh     
34:06     
because I have I I I basically you know I want to be grounded in data     
34:13     
science but I want to look at the ethics and I want to look at like I like like I     
34:20     
want to be able to go to events like this like this is this is a little this is an event here in Boston and um we're     
34:28     
not presenting at this event but as like a social opportunity I'm going to show up here and talk to people and we're     
34:33     
going to talk about what what they're doing um and it's just a it's a     
34:39     
symposium on their computing you know ethics of computing and they have all these like     
34:45     
interesting topics about like you know governments and ethics there's Josh Tenerbomb who I mentioned     
34:52     
on many different fronts but never in AI ethics before so uh you know he does a     
34:58     
ton of stuff with human cooperation and multic learning and cognitive scientist     
35:04     
and like hell yeah I go to a free down the road here and and talk about     
35:09     
this with people um but then also like um actual technology civic engagement     
35:17     
generative AI future democracy like these are the kind of things I definitely want to talk about in the     
35:22     
group um and in in in this project you know we want to go through the technical     
35:29     
side of it and then the direction or like the the other part of it is     
35:34     
essentially how does this shape decision- making or how does this make you know what is the process of signing     
35:40     
off on on this algorithm or this this model how's the model being built but what are the implications and a little     
35:46     
bit more of a it's not just data science and coding in a vacuum it's it's coming     
35:52     
from the standpoint of we're selecting directions for how to go with things when we implement models or think about     
35:59     
how to regulate them and everything else so it's a little bit more of a holistic take it's it's very obviously a     
36:06     
um like society ethics tech uh group i     
36:12     
need to update this whole group um oh this whole page     
36:17     
is like you go through it again and you these things are like this this is not     
36:23     
currently on hiatus um it's very much active and uh the page structure is     
36:29     
wrong so I need to fix that on the website but that's the way it goes you know uh you finally present it you find     
36:35     
the things that you thought you fixed um but it's a very much society     
36:51     
essentially kind of gave me the green light to make I don't know in 2021 or so     
36:57     
and it was just an idea at the time and then it became okay a set of people it became a working group it became it     
37:04     
became a team or if it was a loose a loose idea for a long time and then people came around it and did a lot of     
37:10     
things periodically not a whole lot maybe like once or twice a year to do a few things but there was enough over time     
37:18     
people like um uh shout out to I think here yeah     
37:26     
um was one of like the original people that ever made me go down this path um     
37:31     
she she graduated recently like law and tech stuff so it's just this cool um     
37:37     
she's she's a grad student of law student and future     
37:43     
law in Chile and and and just like you know I'm I'm doing this to say that I     
37:49     
think set and this project are examples of how like if you stay with something over     
37:55     
time with an idea and leaving people or trying to hold space for completely cool     
38:01     
things that come from it and it's evolved in different format So um this     
38:07     
is the latest version of it and please follow data xdirection.com     
38:14     
um and all that stuff for for actual updates because I want to have a few opportunities there's the be inerson     
38:20     
events and meetups and then more like actual data tools um the fundamentals     
38:25     
and like what do you do you know much more applied things there so that's sort     
38:31     
of that project are there any questions or comments before I move on to the other one     
38:38     
um so where like what is the sort of the meat of this is this     
38:43     
kind of like just uh like recommendations or at this point just kind of like this substack discussion or     
38:51     
how are you engaging people basically right now and what I want some for     
38:57     
interns or people in terms of what people can do right now and where I want to go with it     
39:04     
what people can well a lot of right now uh it'll basically be     
39:09     
a discussionoriented group but I want there to be     
39:16     
um one of the things in the internship program is that I want people to get     
39:23     
used to making um public and forward facing material so     
39:30     
yes there will be a lot of writing blog posts and articles like that's amazing that we do that's that's what I really     
39:35     
want to do i don't I I don't want to have a discussion group for this     
39:41     
particular project that meets once a week or a or research i don't want to make it like sort of a cognition futures     
39:49     
which is very exploratory and then not let it out with focus this is sort of that on the other side like I wanted to     
39:55     
be alpha focused in terms of making these like kind of lower more accessible     
40:00     
frontf facing artifacts and then over time um there's certain other uh like     
40:07     
bigger projects I want to I want to develop like I want to investigate there's a bunch of     
40:13     
frameworks like data tools is is is a very data nutrition labels is is like     
40:20     
kind of a generic um     
40:26     
uh it's a label it's it's a simple thing in one glance and then at another level you get to see um like their research     
40:34     
you get to see uh like this this framework I think it's one of the latest things that they published yeah this is     
40:40     
from you know last year but like they're working to sort out this broader framework um and I would love like I     
40:47     
want to be able to discuss and understand these kinds of     
40:53     
um frameworks uh maybe we eventually uh you know um do some comparative analysis     
41:01     
of of different frameworks uh maybe we try to make some of our own frameworks     
41:06     
maybe we identify different different things there's a lot of reports um stuff there too i I I do eventually want to     
41:13     
make some publications to like the the provinces that are supposedly around it     
41:19     
um as explains the uh the facts the the the the ones that are focused on this     
41:26     
topic and eventually the robot um the robot was kind of a uh I wasn't able to     
41:33     
travel for that uh let's say uh this year um to put it lightly and but like I     
41:42     
I would love to actually be a functional contributor to the we robot conference I think that's one of the most critical     
41:48     
areas For those who have kind of um been around me long enough uh I have a     
41:54     
certain reverence for people trying to do the work in all of this space and we     
41:59     
robot especially where it's like you're ask you're asking you're asking people to regulate uh     
42:06     
functionally technology that's that's at an impossibly different     
42:12     
um movement rate speed of speed of uh rate of movement and um comprehension at     
42:21     
large or regulation uh so so you know I     
42:27     
don't I don't I don't know that I'm going to you know train a lot of folks who can     
42:34     
support the robot crowd and and the legislators and the law folks trying to     
42:40     
to to do something with what's going on uh but maybe that's that's a that's a a     
42:46     
sub goal of sorts or or a nice thing that I'm trying to do but yeah it's it's     
42:51     
like at its core right now um and this will depend like like some of the applicants if they want to do some     
42:58     
really cool and depth stuff like I like like wow like I'm kind of you     
43:05     
know certain people in in given the space and and you know what support I     
43:10     
can give them here like they could do some really cool stuff really in depth things but I think I think the majority of like the internship and what we're     
43:16     
having right now is just a lot of fundamental stuff a lot of kind of building out coming on there's a data     
43:22     
science fundamentals is what the ethics um with some current     
43:28     
events around it uh let's let's both make let's have the discussion internally and then let's yes continue     
43:34     
to make these things that other people can interface with because there is an open science a little bit of a public     
43:39     
science a little bit of science communication emphasis to it because I don't I don't I'm completely not     
43:47     
interested at all in talking about this uh behind closed doors and in the     
43:54     
backyard like I don't I don't think that's sort of like I I don't want to have     
44:00     
abstracts and and I don't even I don't even discuss it about like I think there's a great place for like abstract     
44:07     
philosophical discussion i want to have this as long as the discussion is loop but the the the the uh action for bias     
44:15     
or the bias for action or whatever you want to say uh is planted towards okay     
44:20     
we're going to be outputting this stuff because I I I think that's that's how I want to     
44:26     
handle it and um I think it's important to handle some of this that way so I don't know if that answers the question     
44:31     
very well but that's uh that's kind of where where things are and I think that     
44:37     
will change you know after like this summer this is sort of this is like the grand maybe     
44:43     
even a soft opening honestly but sort of like just just coming out of the     
44:49     
incubator um okay anything else before I go into other project i don't want     
44:55     
to ramble too much more i've seen references to this data     
45:01     
nutrition project so could you go talk a little bit about that who's running that     
45:08     
yeah um the front page     
45:13     
um basically this is this is sort of um in the data     
45:20     
pipeline they're they're saying what's that they're trying in in a really in a     
45:26     
really shorthand um way that uh in the data pipeline you have your data set you     
45:33     
have your preview you're looking for data set okay and and then you get a data     
45:39     
We're kind of jumping along here but let's say let's say you're you're searching for a data set at this time an     
45:44     
existing one and then you're going to pre-process it and develop your model and deploy it what they want to do is in     
45:51     
between I don't know selection and where you start fooling around with it let's     
45:56     
say um they want to put something here so     
46:01     
that there's process of streaming right because it's a sort of like especially for big data sets uh you know you get     
46:07     
inside you start kind of messing around with it and stuff it it it can be a lot     
46:13     
of investment so and there sort of a um they want to put something here that     
46:20     
helps that process at a very high level as a trying to facilitate greater     
46:25     
efficiency and maybe things like I don't know about accountability but like     
46:30     
transparency and effectiveness in d sets and before you before you getting before     
46:36     
you even get into it like what can you know up front that will be helpful to you to identify the data set that's at a     
46:42     
very high level what they're trying to do at a much deeper level incompleteness historical data can influence a     
46:49     
algorithms right um algorithms matter so the data we're     
46:55     
trained on there's a missing step in the pipeline though assessing the data set     
47:00     
based on standard quality measures that are both qualitative and quantitative so they're working on     
47:09     
uh they're trying to basically put as much useful information up front as possible now it also go it cuts a little     
47:18     
bit both ways in the sense that it's kind of a nice framework tool almost a     
47:24     
little bit kind of like Frontier Nappy but not quite um in the sense of it trying to provide you a framework of     
47:30     
things that you can under understand uh when you when you're when you're when     
47:36     
you if you are making a data set and you want it you want to give it a label it puts a certain     
47:41     
uh I don't want to say rhetorical pressure but it puts a certain pressure on you is how is this going to look on     
47:47     
the label you know excuse me it will it will help you     
47:53     
think about what someone else needs to use this product or this data set or     
47:58     
this uh this thing this artifact that you're creating a data set h how will it     
48:04     
it help other how how can I make this so other people can interface with it     
48:10     
effectively um and I think that's that's a that's a great thing to do um but then they they have like in their     
48:17     
actual straight of research that they have that clear document school for there there's a very active     
48:24     
um arm actually that reminds me I reached out to them a month or so ago     
48:29     
and they responded to me and I respond to them there's other things I I won't cover um today so I don't want to waste     
48:37     
too much more time on that but it's a really cool project um and it's it's a it's it's sort of     
48:46     
again in this intermediary like it's not really um this this isn't     
48:54     
like doing a you're not this isn't about     
49:01     
crafting an algorithm or setting a model this is about this like     
49:07     
meta work metadata science work or meta science proper whatever you like that     
49:14     
one of the things I haven't said this yet I'm trying to incorporate this language data the data it is like there     
49:20     
is a meta scientific lens that I really like how do we     
49:26     
do how do we talk about what we're doing and how do we you know measure or or try     
49:32     
to make it interface with other and whatnot if you make all these products just like in open source sustainability     
49:38     
stuff you make all these products you don't want to talk about it you document it it just you spend a lot of effort and     
49:43     
diet and nobody uses it it's like okay well like you know you get you can give     
49:48     
yourself a pat on the back about it but then it's it's it's effectively like nothing happened so I think these are     
49:55     
these are all like kind of efforts to um make those points of interface a     
50:02     
little more higher impact or or to waste though or     
50:08     
in the simple waste less energy by saying hey if you put energy into this     
50:14     
thing it might it might savely more or more it's imperfect but     
50:22     
you know that's that's kind of what we're dealing with like we don't there isn't there is not a data nutrition     
50:28     
label there is not a standard association anywhere like like the FDA in the United States that says you have     
50:34     
to have this on your data like like like it like just so people people get it     
50:40     
like they're we're comparing and a very mature and established learning structure and it's questionable or not     
50:47     
uh uh standards um and measures and ways of evaluating to something that doesn't     
50:54     
it doesn't really exist in the same way there's there are things but like not not that level so anyway that's that's     
51:00     
kind of what that is um and then if if I still have I don't     
51:06     
know how much time I have i might just mention other project yeah go ahead yeah     
51:11     
just like show someone and tell but cool um so the other one I'm     
51:22     
just from here to there and yeah I'm working on the logo i don't really know     
51:27     
how to do it right yet um it's been steps all those things are now but for now it's it's just this um is this going     
51:35     
to work yeah I think it's going to work here too     
51:40     
um from here to there is not technical in the way that data is     
51:49     
data direction this is about um I'll show you this in a second but at     
51:56     
a high level um this is sort of all like we talk for     
52:03     
those who were just joining the lab um you may not realize it but like we a     
52:09     
major thing that we talk about or have talked about this work and I've been kind of     
52:16     
em is like professional development and how do you act as an early career     
52:22     
researcher or even how do you act in a leadership role how do you act um what     
52:27     
do you do when you're trying to participate in or lead people or otherwise foster spaces of innovation     
52:36     
like when you're trying to build stuff because it's different like if if you haven't I I like I say this I say this     
52:43     
as someone who like a good chunk of my early career and     
52:48     
in life like I wasn't around innovation space growing up i was around like some college stuff i was around     
52:56     
um like very standard corporate established jobs or like here's what you do and and when you're when you're not     
53:03     
in that space um or or even if you're in the in the you know as as we kind of     
53:09     
I've talked to more and more people in innovation panel but like if you're in if you're in some of these hybrid bigger     
53:14     
corporate spaces like obviously Google sure but also like names like GE and     
53:19     
these other that like technology um or even like     
53:25     
and other parts of the way you're making things like it's different there's a different set of things there     
53:32     
um this project is is uh comes from many years of discussions with     
53:39     
Bradley um and it comes from I mean my interest in mentorship and my interest     
53:46     
in in strategy and leadership in these spaces and um I what I really want to do I guess is     
53:54     
as good as anything to go here what I really want to do is sort of like     
54:02     
um across different levels of of development like not just where you are     
54:08     
in your career but but sort of like there are certain things that are much higher level um in terms of setting     
54:15     
broader visions in terms of setting uh agendas and strategically navigating     
54:21     
towards either what what like the market or the economy or whatever it's     
54:26     
there are these bigger macro trends that have their own space and that's kind of what this is about um there's leading     
54:34     
teams doing the stuff like I've been fortunate the last several years to to kind of sit in on people making hardware     
54:42     
people making software people trying to do AI work and like how do you if you're     
54:47     
trying to make product what do you do like like how do you deal in     
54:54     
um start environment and industry environment and nonprofits what if it's what if it's just a group of your     
55:00     
friends or college teammates or colleagues and you really care about something and you meet you know a couple     
55:07     
times a month and uh it's just you talking about it and you want you want to do more than talk about     
55:13     
it that's that's what that's what a lot of what we're talking about here is i know it doesn't sound like it but like a     
55:19     
lot of what we've done here a lot of things in other groups a lot of people trying to just make that make an app or     
55:26     
make a framework that's what they've been doing right and it's not as prestigious as saying "Oh I I'm you know     
55:33     
I work at Nvidia and I'm I'm I'm developing the latest the next generation of this hardware whatever."     
55:39     
Like no it's not but it but um there's different things that you could be saying doesn't that matter and it's like     
55:45     
super you know at the early career level a lot all that's really here so far like     
55:50     
this is all early career early career this is kind of visionary but like um what do you do what do you do when     
55:57     
you're a first time speaker on a panel what do you do when you're planning to do this thing like these sort     
56:05     
of you know when you're just getting into the space of innovation of     
56:12     
creation what is it like what I really want to do is have all this a little a lot of a lot of things     
56:19     
that I've seen saying "Oh this is this is exclusively for CEOs if you're a senior you need to know this." And it's     
56:26     
like "Yeah but like I want these to be able to talk to each other i I want I want there to be some overlap and saying     
56:32     
when you're in this role you can think about how to communicate here and how to develop people here i don't want it to     
56:39     
be I don't want it to be um a lot of these things are dealt in isolation and     
56:44     
I find that to be like okay but then it arbitrarily     
56:50     
makes esoteric the other layers of things and I feel like     
56:56     
well if you're going to you know bring someone into this seriously and my my     
57:01     
point of view also is like we need people to innovate things very desperately     
57:07     
Um but if we don't teach them how to do it or how to relate to each other and     
57:13     
and how to cultivate each other in doing it then you're not you're not going to get it it's not going to     
57:20     
happen like not not to the degree that anything will happen but outside of that     
57:25     
uh take I suppose um I'm gonna there other things like     
57:31     
this book reviews podcast interviews i'm gonna I'm gonna I have in my hand some microphones right now and I have a lot I     
57:40     
have a lot I'm trying to do but like so many of our discussions are really great this interview we've had here so for a     
57:46     
long time I was like hey what about like discussions about development stuff I     
57:51     
was like that's that's happening now finally um so I'll do that um current     
57:58     
events stuff um all these things I want to talk about too uh but this is a     
58:04     
little bit more of a um I don't know like     
58:11     
I I've been um Whoops     
58:17     
um I've spent a lot more time in the um let's     
58:22     
say I don't want to say consulting like it's a little bit too self- congratulatory space but like     
58:30     
um in sort of advising and coaching and developing stuff space and I want to do     
58:36     
more in that space i've wanted to do that for a long time throw back to even     
58:42     
um like when I was a the genie opportunities for leadership development     
58:47     
program like seeing seeing those things in that time how much that like gave me the space to think about this stuff at     
58:54     
at an earlier stage when I was absolutely a younger man and a uh you     
59:01     
know just getting started think there were that there was a space to talk about some of these things um and how do     
59:06     
you run a meeting and how do you you know deal with like like what is your leadership approach like how are you     
59:12     
going to handle stuff and and giving people a sense of agency about that stuff is huge so um there's a lot I want     
59:18     
to do here and I'm hoping to incorporate a little bit of this     
59:24     
into like for a long time to go all the way back here     
59:29     
like it's kind of been coming soon but it's it's it's been     
59:34     
um it's much further along than it has been and so this is part of a part of     
59:41     
that and I'm looking forward to what is what does it really mean right now it'll     
59:46     
be a little more focused stuff like instead of kind of just having these freestyle talks for sometimes their     
59:52     
brand said that but like instead of having freestyle talks on um our open source meetings I'll have     
1:00:00     
hey look at this article I the team or whatever I've written and we'll talk about it and we     
1:00:07     
can maybe have a little more constructive discussion about it um that's something that will happen this summer and then like I really I I'm I I     
1:00:15     
have interviews from the innovation panel from NIC uh that I I I will be     
1:00:21     
conducting soon and I want I want to get used to talking about like I want to have much more conversations about this     
1:00:27     
this is one of my sort of interesting passions in life i've always been this sort of teaching um and and how do you     
1:00:34     
enable people to do it was a great thing but like to do     
1:00:40     
important new things um and I'm I'm happy that this     
1:00:46     
project has sort of taken off a little bit um I want to also make kind of an internship type thing for this i don't     
1:00:53     
really know what to call it because a data ethics intern Um like that's a     
1:00:58     
thing i'm not making that up you know it's it's it's maybe a bit niche to actually data ethics and not just you're     
1:01:06     
a data science do some data science work and yeah we'll talk about things like this is really focused on the stuff and     
1:01:12     
it's great but for here I'm a little bit less sure how to structure this but I I     
1:01:18     
really love to involve other people into it for sure um so yeah     
1:01:25     
um that's basically what that project is uh there's a lot more to come with it     
1:01:31     
these are all kind of just these soft launches I suppose but we are doing things     
1:01:38     
here people for it um if if anyone's excited about this     
1:01:44     
just reach out um and then I guess um oh did I     
1:01:53     
uh let me see something else then just to I mean we I won't I think taking up a lot of     
1:02:01     
time so I won't go in the summer cohort too much but basically it's     
1:02:07     
um it's built around Google home and we are in the process I'm getting I'm sure     
1:02:14     
you're getting them too of like hey where are you in the process evaluating the performance and you know they are     
1:02:21     
reviewing things and we'll get back to you about it um but but code     
1:02:29     
ser in the summertime wants to say any more in     
1:02:34     
depth about that but that's that's going to be a lot built around that and about     
1:02:40     
around that structure um and the cohort is sort of the the     
1:02:45     
broader the cohort itself is sort of like for people that don't necessarily get the legal funding for people that     
1:02:51     
want to do adjacent project people that want to come in and talk about the open like join the open source strategy to     
1:02:57     
just talk about like open source life and like professional stuff i might try to throw in some specific things for     
1:03:03     
like data direction leadership too but it it's just the whole apparatus as a     
1:03:09     
whole i'm looking forward to it um a lot of fun as always and from     
1:03:16     
what I've seen the proposals some very promising proposals so far and uh I'll     
1:03:23     
defer to Brad if you want to say yeah well yeah thanks for that i I think     
1:03:30     
yeah this This will be a nice uh addition and dovetail to the open source     
1:03:36     
meetings when we start up a bit so you know I would like to have you know     
1:03:41     
weekly feature of this type we can you know kind of go through and you have the     
1:03:47     
freedom to kind of do what you want each week so I think it'll always be a good     
1:03:53     
conversation i wanna I wanna uh     
1:03:59     
um I will reply to that um and I don't know if you want to say more Bradley but I I I respect the question i just want     
1:04:06     
to know more how like what do you mean like motivated in what sense because I I could see a whole bunch of     
1:04:14     
question like whatever your person like what you post and stuff sometimes people     
1:04:21     
start with things but then we often stop doing things that like what keeps you     
1:04:26     
motivated to continue it or how did you start yeah I mean that's     
1:04:33     
absolutely true and what there's there's sort of a few different answers here     
1:04:39     
um the the the like really um appealing     
1:04:47     
answer I think that a lot of people are sort of uh almost easy to say is like     
1:04:55     
well it's just something I'm really passionate about my passion fuels me and and I I care about why I do it um and     
1:05:02     
that's true but like a maybe more real version of that is I think there are probably in     
1:05:12     
somewhere in the double digits of abandoned or derelict or just     
1:05:20     
projects and blogs that I've started or that have failed quote unquote failed     
1:05:27     
and it it     
1:05:33     
That's okay like I I think I think sometimes the you know you hear things like that fail fast     
1:05:39     
and fail upward or whatever and yeah you can do that but like it's it's really just about um there's a there's a great     
1:05:47     
I'm actually writing something about something in this lab and Bradley says has said many times momentum is     
1:05:52     
sometimes more important than progress or there was a great quote somewhere I saw that basically the same about like     
1:05:58     
iteration like iteration is more important than like a perfect idea     
1:06:04     
and it's motivation but also like the the motivation I think for me     
1:06:11     
comes from earnestly showing up and thinking     
1:06:18     
about what what do you want to do here like if you can show up over time and     
1:06:24     
address the question that you want to solve or whatever like whatever it is that you want to do if you can     
1:06:31     
repeatedly show up and go to the space of earnest inquiry about something     
1:06:37     
um that will tell you where to go and and especially especially for people     
1:06:43     
making this is why I appreciate the question especially in the context of trying to innovate or do new things     
1:06:50     
because if you're trying to just if you're trying to just reproduce something then it's a it's a totally     
1:06:56     
different situation but if you are trying to make new things or you're earnestly curious in ways that people     
1:07:02     
don't talk about something currently or you don't like a situation you want to change something     
1:07:09     
you showing up and putting effort in may not look the same and the outcome and results may not follow a standard     
1:07:16     
pattern so I think it's a very important question um and and it's sort of along     
1:07:21     
the way I think I think what great mentors do is help you identify what it     
1:07:26     
is that actually matters to you or what are the goals that are available and what is a landscape for you to work on     
1:07:33     
and I think it's sort of a delicate act of     
1:07:39     
identifying what you can do but then also what what is there to be done and     
1:07:46     
kind of connecting the concern the legitimate concern or interest whatever whatever the internal spark is to sort     
1:07:53     
of the intermediary spaces of what you can do in the world to the actual direction of where you want to go with     
1:07:59     
it like that's super high that's a super involved and complicated high level thing uh like but I'm putting a lot of     
1:08:07     
parts there uh but but to boil it to to to to boil it down again is sort of like     
1:08:14     
it's really just showing up a lot and and and you can say believing in yourself like like there's a lot of this     
1:08:21     
I don't know you got to be really strong willed or whatever to to make or innovate things and that's probably true     
1:08:27     
in some ways but it can also just be like I'm committed to holding a     
1:08:34     
meeting and talking about these other people once or twice a week or a month     
1:08:40     
and letting things come from that it's not you know it can take many different forms but I think it's sort of     
1:08:46     
identifying that you have something that really matters to you or is interesting     
1:08:51     
and finding ways to get community around it or finding ways to share the journey     
1:08:57     
or finding ways just to sometimes you have to go by yourself too um so yeah I know that's that's sort of     
1:09:04     
a lot of different uh approaches to it but it it changes over time what you     
1:09:11     
feel like you can do evolves as well so it's kind of just a lot of listening to     
1:09:18     
what that is yeah thank you Jesse that was great i'm glad to see that you've got these new     
1:09:24     
projects so you have your JPro site and that's where you're hosting some of that     
1:09:29     
and then you have the substack um how many substacks you have what is     
1:09:36     
the number um I I've decided for for these projects     
1:09:41     
specifically and and in my sort of framework for what is a project I'm     
1:09:47     
working with else they're working with just the the broader things I made the     
1:09:54     
Jerro website sort of a front page uh to to show other people all the stuff going     
1:10:00     
on like almost like an outlet like it's for this lab for the train for the groups     
1:10:06     
and the partners that we have that are trying to do stuff but substack specifically for     
1:10:12     
these two projects seemed on point like I'm not making a substack for like commission features or for like society     
1:10:18     
ethics tech or whatever but these products are very output and like     
1:10:24     
deliverable oriented to that scale so those are just the two those are just the two ones i have like a personal     
1:10:30     
substack which I don't know like I'm going to write in there and one for Joe to basically be another outlet for the     
1:10:36     
website like it's basically just there's there's so much like I'm backlogged     
1:10:42     
this like sort out where things need to go and how they're released but it's     
1:10:48     
really just those two um and realizing that too like Like another another     
1:10:54     
another another point to the question that was raised a few moments ago like part of it too is like you have to build     
1:11:01     
some kind of external system that facilitates at least in my experience is     
1:11:08     
like you're going to have to find some way to have external like     
1:11:16     
selfm maintaining the system experience somehow like like it's like like unless     
1:11:23     
you want it just to be like a personal set of writings which you can you don't need anything that's just on you but if     
1:11:29     
if you're trying to do things in the world you have to find some some system of of of having things     
1:11:38     
be anchored somewhere and ideally there can be a little bit of a homeostasis around it um and so to I'm I'm I'm I'm     
1:11:48     
saying that because the subsects we're not always there they're not they're not just they're not just like oh I want to I want to make content they're there now     
1:11:55     
because these ideas these ideas have been in development for decades um at     
1:12:01     
least the leadership one and maybe half a decade or at least the last two years     
1:12:06     
of my degree um was was the data in production one so like like these things     
1:12:13     
are um not just a bunch of ideas I had they're they're refined integrated over     
1:12:20     
time and the subsects are just just those two so     
1:12:25     
um at least many ones right now so yeah and there you can just go to the website     
1:12:30     
and I happen thank you for listening oh no     
1:12:38     
problem yeah I look forward to maybe working on some of this this summer in     
1:12:44     
open source open science whatever that meeting is uh     
1:12:49     
yeah so I know that Morgan is at the California Neuroscience Conference or     
1:12:56     
Neuroch Conference or whatever it is um but this week uh there was another     
1:13:02     
conference we talked about this last week there was ICLR which is the     
1:13:08     
um sort of maybe like an applied version of the roots i'm not really sure how to describe it but um so ICLR 2025 the 13th     
1:13:19     
International Conference on Learning Representations but this is the website ICLR so this is it's in in person in     
1:13:28     
Singapore so we have the uh inerson component but I think there's     
1:13:34     
stuff you know online um definitely you know we can look at maybe some of the uh     
1:13:42     
workshops and the schedule to see what that looks like they also have their     
1:13:47     
papers uh like blog posts workshop workshop proposals on openreview.net     
1:13:53     
okay so this is the Wikipedia page on ICLR thank you Morgan for posting this     
1:14:00     
it's you know happens all over the world actually um and so yeah it started right after     
1:14:08     
Imagenet so in 2013 they had their first one um and so     
1:14:16     
these are one of the three primary conferences of high impact in machine learning and artificial intelligence     
1:14:22     
research it was actually Yan Lun was one of the originators of the conference of course     
1:14:29     
they have their open peer review and open review and then the workshops and everything else so um let's take a look     
1:14:37     
at what they do here so the schedule um here's the     
1:14:45     
schedule uh they had some invited talks uh Wednesday last Wednesday I guess uh     
1:14:53     
they had they started the conference uh they had uh some invited talks building     
1:15:00     
safe and robust AI systems another invited talk on overflow building safe     
1:15:06     
and robust AI systems then he had a bunch of oral     
1:15:11     
sessions um they had these birds of the feather sessions so this one was towards     
1:15:18     
tokenizer free end to end architectures large language models in the public     
1:15:24     
sector AI for mathematics and theorem proving which we've talked about in this meeting which are very fascinating that     
1:15:32     
area um agent research in the real world and     
1:15:38     
expo talk panel another expo talk panel on antin inclusion AI a fully open     
1:15:44     
source project for larger language models from reinforcement learning reasoning to agents that sounds really     
1:15:51     
interesting we talked about um ant swarm intelligence or ant colony     
1:15:58     
optimization um in a previous meeting I believe So     
1:16:03     
that that's kind of an application uh reinforcement learning uh this one here invited talk     
1:16:11     
framework prototype definition and benchmark     
1:16:16     
um and then we have you know the next day Thursday     
1:16:21     
uh let's see this invited talk pursuing the nature of intelligence that looks     
1:16:28     
interesting um or if they have a abstract they would have the abstract here so in this talk     
1:16:35     
we will try to clarify different levels and mechanisms of intelligence for historical scientific     
1:16:43     
mathematical and computational perspectives uh from the evolution of intelligence in     
1:16:48     
nature from phoggenetic to anttogenetic to societal and artificial intelligence     
1:16:55     
will try to shed light on how to understand the true nature of the seemingly dramatic advances in the     
1:17:00     
technologies of machine learn intelligence in the past decade we achieved this goal by developing a     
1:17:06     
principled mathematical framework to explain the practice of deep learning from the perspective of compressive data     
1:17:13     
encoding and decoding this framework not only reveals true nature uh hence     
1:17:19     
limitations of the current practice but it also provides principles guidelines     
1:17:24     
to develop more complete more efficient learning architectures and systems eventually we will clarify the     
1:17:30     
difference in relationship between knowledge and intelligence which may guide us to pursue the goal of developing systems with true     
1:17:38     
intelligence that was a talk um so they kind of focus on this phoggenetic     
1:17:44     
anttogenetic and societal aspect of intelligence we talked about the     
1:17:49     
phoggenetic aspect a couple weeks ago we talked about like bird intelligence versus mamalian intelligence and the     
1:17:56     
sort of the underpinnings of all that so this is kind of an interesting approach bringing that into this this kind of     
1:18:03     
conference um see there is a social women and     
1:18:09     
machine learning another social AI safety and practice Virginia     
1:18:17     
challenges any other talks here this one Eureka evaluating and understanding     
1:18:24     
large foundation models this one here human attention is not all you     
1:18:29     
need what were you laughing at this     
1:18:41     
one uh yeah I I didn't I didn't catch that either i don't know what it was oh yeah     
1:18:49     
I don't know let's see what this is uh oh access denied both uh I guess we'll never know um then     
1:18:59     
Friday they had uh Uh some     
1:19:06     
socials uh let's see oh open source decentralized the AI community     
1:19:12     
social um what else training language models in academia challenger     
1:19:20     
calling uh there's another one down here well there's AI multi- aent systems in     
1:19:26     
enterprise researcher world applications machine learning for digital     
1:19:33     
twins um open-endedness world models and the     
1:19:39     
automation of innovation that sounds really interesting that was an invited     
1:19:44     
talk that abstract is uh the pursuit of artificial super intelligence requires a     
1:19:51     
shift from narrow objective optimization towards embracing open-endedness     
1:19:57     
research paradigm pioneered in AI by Stanley layman include talked about the     
1:20:03     
open-endedness work um and that the work on like creativity and that sort of     
1:20:08     
thing uh that is focused on systems that generate endless sequences of novel but     
1:20:13     
learnable artifacts in this talk I will present our work on large-scale foundation world models that can     
1:20:20     
generate a wide variety of diverse environments that can in turn be used to train more general and robust     
1:20:26     
agents furthermore I will argue that the connection between open-endedness and foundation models points towards     
1:20:32     
automating innovation itself this convergence is already yielding practical results enabling     
1:20:40     
self-reerential self-improvement loops self-reerential self-improvement for     
1:20:45     
automated prompt engineering automated red teaming and AI debate in large     
1:20:50     
language models and it hints at a future where AI drives its own     
1:20:57     
discoveries so they kind of it's interesting they kind of mention open-endedness but then they kind of     
1:21:02     
hint at this sort of these loops or self-improvement loops which are I     
1:21:07     
assume clos loop systems they could be open loop systems I suppose but uh this is kind of an interesting     
1:21:16     
connection all right um and then this one this is the same     
1:21:22     
invited talk I get this yeah it's the same invited talk i don't know whether they have a choice but okay     
1:21:30     
um this one this is Saturday so there were some workshops     
1:21:36     
uh so the workshops start at about 5:30 p.m     
1:21:42     
singapore time so you had machine learning multiskll     
1:21:47     
processes x AI for science this is from understanding model behavior to discover     
1:21:53     
new scientific knowledge the second workshop on foundation models in the     
1:22:00     
wilds agent AI for science hypothesis generation     
1:22:06     
comprehension quantification and validation workshop on human AI     
1:22:11     
co-evolution which is uh the abstract for that is uh     
1:22:18     
this workshop aims to build a multid-disiplinary research community around the emerging field of human AI     
1:22:24     
core evolution or HIC I guess that's a new term to understand the feedback     
1:22:30     
loops that emerge from the continuous and long-term human AI interactions that exist in the world as AI systems have     
1:22:38     
become more prevalent and have been present in society around the period Scholars from diverse fields and     
1:22:44     
methodologies have come to focus on HIC and its importance for system architecture human feedback regulation     
1:22:52     
and other domains through this workshop we hope to lay a collaborative foundation for this research agenda to     
1:22:59     
achieve this we will organize expert talks from academia and industry dynamic panel discussions interactive breakout     
1:23:07     
sessions and networking opportunities drawing on our diverse experience organizing related workshops leading     
1:23:14     
conferences in machine learning natural language processing HCI fields so that's     
1:23:22     
um that's an kind of an interesting approach to that     
1:23:27     
topic uh this other workshop modular collaborative and decentralized deep     
1:23:32     
learning a very interesting topic so this one is a     
1:23:38     
workshop website I guess the content is not available unless you register which makes sense but uh you know I so I don't     
1:23:46     
know but we can just get a sense of what's going on     
1:23:52     
um so uh this is for modular collaborative and decentralized deep     
1:23:57     
learning uh the increased increasing complexity of modern machine learning models exposes the limitations of the     
1:24:05     
traditional monolithic approach to their development raising concerns about cost and     
1:24:12     
sustainability this workshop challenges this approach by advocating for a new paradigm based on modular design and     
1:24:19     
functional specialization inspired by principles from software engineering we envision a     
1:24:25     
future where models are composed of independently trainable modules enabling asynchronous development incremental     
1:24:32     
updates and cross test generalization for composability     
1:24:37     
this shift towards modularity unlocks new possibilities for collaborative model development where researchers can     
1:24:44     
contribute specialized modules by existing modules participating in decentralized training schemes by     
1:24:51     
embracing modularity we can democratize deep learning research enabling smaller     
1:24:56     
teams and institutions to contribute to the development of powerful and efficient models furthermore modularity     
1:25:03     
promises to enhance model interpretability and maintainability paving the way for more     
1:25:09     
robust and efficient AI systems this workshop aims to accelerate     
1:25:14     
the transition towards a more collaborative and sustainable future for     
1:25:19     
deep learning so basically a focus on modularity composability generalization     
1:25:26     
etc so sort of these meta topics or meta organizational     
1:25:33     
principles oh and then let's see     
1:25:39     
um did want to go over the workshop website actually so uh this is the     
1:25:44     
workshop on modularity for collaborative decentralizing deep uh I don't know if     
1:25:50     
they had the papers on the website but these are the contributors and I don't see any of the     
1:25:57     
papers probably on the open     
1:26:08     
review okay um so yeah then there's this workshop     
1:26:14     
integrating generative and experimental platforms for biomolecular design     
1:26:19     
this also has a workshop website biomolecular design to artificial engineering proteins lians and nucleic     
1:26:27     
acids will demands promise for addressing pressing medical industrial environment     
1:26:32     
challenges while generative machine learning has shown significant potential in this area a palpable disconnect     
1:26:39     
exists with experimental biology and that is many machine learning research efforts prioritize     
1:26:46     
static benchmark performance potentially sidelining impactful biological applications so basically the way we do     
1:26:54     
benchmarking for these kind of machine learning algorithms actually aren't     
1:27:00     
suitable for biological applications where you may need to do real time analysis or the the benchmark simple     
1:27:07     
aren't sufficient we run into this problem in deep world all the time trying to work with embryos and other     
1:27:14     
types of uh uh biological imaging and so you know benchmarking is sort of     
1:27:22     
relative right you have things that you know a lot of the benchmarks we have or     
1:27:28     
for like image data sets that are standard images you know sometimes they     
1:27:34     
have very easy features easy to to segment things like that and in biology     
1:27:39     
we have kind of the opposite situation and then factor benchmarks or useful benchmarks there involve things like uh     
1:27:48     
you know having a heavy degree of noise sometimes we need to have take noise into account as part of the signal um     
1:27:56     
there all sorts of you know things complexities edge cases that are you     
1:28:03     
know important for the benchmark to pick up on that if we were in a normal situation like you know a normal     
1:28:10     
benchmark for image processing we would uh you know not capture capture so     
1:28:18     
um that's an interesting observation this workshop seeks to bridge this gap     
1:28:23     
by bringing computationalists and experimentalists together catalyzing a deeper interdisciplinary discourse     
1:28:31     
together we will explore the strengths and challenges of generative machine learning and biology experimental     
1:28:37     
integration of generative machine learning and biological problems ready for machine learning so you have to     
1:28:43     
define your problems find a data set and then those problems are very hard to     
1:28:49     
it's not like a typical applied machine learning problem it's not as packaged uh     
1:28:55     
sometimes you get you know single kinds of analyses you want to     
1:29:01     
do but the biological problems are deeper than that and often more open-ended in the sense that it just     
1:29:07     
raises more questions and that's fine but it's not you know you can't use a     
1:29:13     
standard production pipeline in Florida it's it's politely difficult to attract     
1:29:19     
high quality and diverse research we partnered with nature biotechnology for a special collection and we created     
1:29:26     
dedicated tracks for incilico machine learning research and hybrid machine learning experimental biology research     
1:29:33     
our lineup features emerging leaders as speakers and renowned scientists as panelists encapsulating a spectrum from     
1:29:40     
high throughput experimentation and computational biology to generative machine learning     
1:29:46     
with a diverse organizing team and backed by industry sponsors we dedicate the work pushing the boundaries of     
1:29:53     
machine learning general biology so this is the work this is     
1:30:01     
the gem workshop uh speakers are here     
1:30:08     
so George Church is one of the speakers uh Mike Moy is one of the     
1:30:16     
speakers some other people here so yeah and then uh I don't know if     
1:30:23     
they have papers this is gym 2024 this is generative and experimental perspectives for biomolecular design so     
1:30:30     
they're actually doing like uh they did one in 2024 I guess so this is their uh     
1:30:39     
workshop so this is where they're kind of putting the they put the papers from the proceedings in a journal so this one     
1:30:46     
was in cell systems the next year 2025 would be nature     
1:30:52     
biotechnology if they have a link to the actual special issue i don't think so     
1:30:57     
but yeah so yeah this is cool and then the call for papers here they had a call     
1:31:04     
for papers where they had two tracks machine learning and biology the machine learning track was uh dealt with papers     
1:31:12     
that introduced generative advancements for biomolecular design within silicut     
1:31:17     
results basically you know uh using generative AI to produce computational     
1:31:23     
results inverse design modeling and incilical benchmarks     
1:31:30     
and then the biology track which is biological problems and data right for generative machine learning and     
1:31:35     
deployment of machine learning for biomolecular design with wet lab experimental results and that would be     
1:31:43     
you know the focus there would be biological problems apt for machine learning applications high throughput     
1:31:50     
data generation methods adaptive experimental design and again incilical     
1:31:55     
benchmarks and articles so     
1:32:05     
Okay so that's uh then you know continuing with the     
1:32:11     
workshops there was a robot learning workshop uh towards robots with human level     
1:32:18     
abilities uh this workshop will synthetic data finally solve the data access problem and this is     
1:32:26     
u the workshop website as well this one uh accessing large scale     
1:32:32     
and high quality data has been shown to be one of the most important factors to the performance of machine learning     
1:32:38     
models so this is where you need to have real data to train the model to verify     
1:32:44     
the results etc recent work show that large language models can be great     
1:32:49     
greatly benefit from training with massive data from diverse read domain     
1:32:54     
specific sources and aligning with user intention however the use of certain data sources     
1:33:01     
can trigger privacy fairness copyright and safety concerns the impressive     
1:33:07     
performance of generative artificial intelligence popularized the usage of by the usage of synthetic data and many     
1:33:14     
research suggest guided synthesis uh synthesization or     
1:33:20     
synthesization can be useful for both general purpose and domain specific applications     
1:33:26     
so I guess there's this idea that you can use synthetic data to guide or to     
1:33:36     
supervise train which is interesting i mean with synthetic data usually use it     
1:33:42     
to fill in the gaps uh where you don't have data you might use it as a way to sort of train in a     
1:33:48     
pattern to the to the uh algorithm but this is where they're actually kind of     
1:33:53     
suggesting almost like a a supervised learning component to this uh synthetic     
1:33:59     
data instead of maybe like data labels or something like that for example you at all     
1:34:06     
2024 she atel 2024 how atall 2024 demonstrate promising preliminary     
1:34:14     
results in synthesizing private like data while woo at all 2024 highlight     
1:34:19     
existing gaps and challenges as techniques like     
1:34:24     
self-instruct self-alignment those two methods gain traction researchers are questioning the     
1:34:32     
implications of synthetic data which is in this review by Al Mohamah     
1:34:39     
um and Shulingov those are three review     
1:34:46     
articles on these synthetic data sets and their role in machine learning uh     
1:34:51     
will synthetic data ultimately solve the data access problem for machine learning this workshop sets seeks to address this     
1:34:58     
question by highlighting the limitations and opportunities of synthetic data so     
1:35:03     
this is uh definitely kind of an interesting topic     
1:35:09     
um and you know we haven't talked too much about synthetic data in terms of     
1:35:14     
its role in you know just kind of speculating on its role in machine learning but this is     
1:35:21     
the uh website     
1:35:29     
synthesis and limitations of synthetic data new algorithms for synthetic data     
1:35:35     
generation new applications using synthetic data using it for model     
1:35:40     
training and evaluation improving specific model capabilities such as reasoning math and     
1:35:47     
coding synthetic data to address privacy fairness and safety evaluation of synthetic data     
1:35:55     
quality and models trained on synthetic data conditional and unconditional     
1:36:01     
synthetic data generation uh data access of federated learning and privacy preserving     
1:36:08     
methods and mixing synthetic and natural     
1:36:17     
data so that that's certainly something interesting uh to think     
1:36:23     
about okay uh then there was this other workshop uh this is still on Saturday     
1:36:30     
improve self-improving foundation models without human supervision another workshop on machine     
1:36:36     
learning for genomics and explorations which they call MLG X     
1:36:43     
uh new frontiers and associated memories neural network weights as a new     
1:36:50     
data module uh modality so this is an interesting one given some of the     
1:36:56     
discussions we've had about Weight Watchers and some of the other tools     
1:37:01     
having to do with neural network weights focusing on that and training um the     
1:37:07     
ongoing deep learning revolution of the last decade has brought about hundreds of millions of neural networks trained     
1:37:13     
on diverse data sets at the same time the recent rise of foundation models has     
1:37:18     
led to a rapid increase in the number of publicly available models on hugging     
1:37:24     
face alone there were over a million models with thousands more added daily as a     
1:37:31     
result the ample knowledge contained in the data the abstraction learned via training as well as the training models     
1:37:38     
behaviors themselves are stored in the architectures and parameters of training networks despite this massive growth     
1:37:46     
little research has been conducted in the processing into processing model weights and they are rarely considered a     
1:37:52     
data mod uh this workshop aims to create a community around weight based on by     
1:37:58     
bringing together the scattered sub communities that already interface with model weights with the ultimate goal of     
1:38:04     
democratizing model weights as a proper data modality so this is the website for     
1:38:10     
the workshop this is a workshop on weight space     
1:38:16     
learning uh let's see     
1:38:24     
speakers familiar with any of them accepted papers this is uh papers and     
1:38:31     
posters so this uh first one is adversarial robustness and parameter     
1:38:36     
space classifiers there's equivariant neural function network for networks for     
1:38:42     
transformers there's ediabatic fine-tuning of neural quantum     
1:38:48     
states model diffusion for certifiable fot transfer learning and then     
1:38:53     
integrating metatitra hyperet networks with GBDTS and retrieval for     
1:38:59     
tabular and there were some posters fusion of graph neural networks via optimal     
1:39:06     
transport finding stable subnet networks at initialization with data data set distillation     
1:39:13     
the space between unfolding symmetries and sampling a model zoo vision     
1:39:21     
transformers a model zoo on phase transitions and neural networks     
1:39:27     
um and on and on i mean there are a lot of interesting things here but yeah this     
1:39:33     
is another really interesting topic     
1:39:39     
uh let's see uh then there was this other one workshop on sparsity and large language     
1:39:45     
models or SLMs deep dive into mixture of experts quantization hardware     
1:39:53     
inference uh and then finally the future of machine learning data practices and     
1:40:00     
repositories then there were some other workshops on Sunday uh workshop on reasoning and planning     
1:40:07     
for large language models emerging possibilities and challenges in     
1:40:12     
deep learning for code uh this I can't believe it's not better challenges applied in applied     
1:40:20     
deep learning there is another similar workshop topic like I can't believe it     
1:40:25     
worked or something like that anyways this is this is kind of cute     
1:40:30     
um then uh some other workshops here uh AI for Matt ICR 2025 A AI for     
1:40:39     
accelerated materials design workshop on spurious correlation and shortcut learning foundations and     
1:40:46     
solutions and then the workshop on world models which is this one that I wanted     
1:40:53     
to talk about because we've been talking about world models so the abstract here is our     
1:41:02     
workshop covers the widest range of topics related to world models including understanding modeling and closely     
1:41:09     
aligning with cutting edge generative AI and broader applications such as robotics and embodied it we are glad to     
1:41:17     
announce that nine confirmed top tier researchers including the founder of world models have confirmed to attend in     
1:41:23     
person as speakers and panelists the workshop widely targets AI researchers     
1:41:29     
industry professionals and students uh also topics is such as     
1:41:35     
generative AI reinforcement learning related applications so familiarity with recent     
1:41:42     
advancements in both fields will be beneficial but not mandatory uh so then they kind of go through uh     
1:41:50     
some of the things that we you know they talk about kind of the uh application     
1:41:57     
domains that might be relevant in summary our topics of interest mainly     
1:42:02     
include but are not limited to understanding world rules world model     
1:42:07     
training and evaluation scaling world models across language vision and control world models in general domains     
1:42:15     
for the contributed paper section okay so let's go to the workshop website this     
1:42:20     
is world models at ICLR so this kind of gets maybe into some of what they're trying to do     
1:42:27     
here this workshop explores classical world modeling backbones for     
1:42:32     
understanding and modeling the world such as transformers RNN state base models spati     
1:42:39     
temporal modeling of causality analysis building from these foundational topics     
1:42:44     
the workshop will also discuss the broader and evolving concept of world models of complex or world prediction     
1:42:50     
and simulation like video text generation and more specific     
1:42:56     
applications um let's see     
1:43:03     
uh the this workshop covers the widest range of world mo world models topics including understanding modeling as well     
1:43:10     
as scaling with cutting edge generative AI um and then we talk about sort of     
1:43:18     
these different topics within world models such as model based reinforcement learning causality sequential modeling     
1:43:26     
simulation of the environment diffusion models video generation foundational     
1:43:32     
models 2D to 3D robotics and embodied     
1:43:37     
AI and then you know they talk about these different types of topics such as     
1:43:42     
understanding world rules exploring how world models capture environmental     
1:43:48     
dynamics causal understanding spatialor patterns model based reinforcement     
1:43:54     
learning theoretical foundations for simulation and prediction uh the second one is world model     
1:44:01     
training and evaluation strengths limitations and challenges of current model architectures such as state space     
1:44:08     
models RN transformers but also training algorithms such as autogressive training     
1:44:14     
diffusion modeling reinforcement modeling normalizing flow we talked about uh flow matching we talked about     
1:44:22     
diffusion modeling uh we've talked about reinforcement learning not auto reggressive training that's just     
1:44:27     
basically auto reggression which you we might talk about in in a upcoming     
1:44:34     
meeting uh then there's scaling world model prediction and generation across language vision and control this is     
1:44:42     
investigating how integrating visual auditory and textual data improves realism in     
1:44:48     
models they have world models in general domains exploring world models in     
1:44:53     
robotics AI healthcare natural and social sciences and beyond to improve     
1:44:59     
prediction and decision then there are of course benchmarks data sets and demonstrations     
1:45:05     
about world models such as environment simulation     
1:45:10     
so that's uh you know that was pretty open-ended     
1:45:16     
actually so that's good um looks like Morgan left i know he was at the conference as a shame because I wanted     
1:45:23     
to ask him about the world models uh workshop but that's okay uh so did we     
1:45:29     
have any uh questions about that any comments     
1:45:37     
i didn't have any questions about that but I had questions about other other     
1:45:44     
sorry I uh I had questions about other comments okay other conferences ahead     
1:45:53     
okay um and even like like I think I did something about     
1:45:59     
Oh yeah and because I saw I was I was going through my emails trying to find     
1:46:06     
nothing but them i don't we can continue talking about that but just sort of like     
1:46:12     
uh things that we're trying to trying to do ahead     
1:46:17     
and we don't go through like the whole uh you know     
1:46:22     
uh whatever that thing like Excel sheet     
1:46:29     
stuff and there's a lot of things I've applied to a bunch of stuff but I I don't know     
1:46:34     
what like did the meta-cience thing happen is that still happening is is real life     
1:46:41     
happening i don't I feel like I missed so much about that yeah so I don't think     
1:46:46     
we're going to do a life this year okay so I don't think we're going to do medicine     
1:46:54     
i I got some email from them about like I don't know if it's just a life     
1:47:00     
reviewing stuff or program stuff i don't know i don't know so that's why I'm asking     
1:47:07     
there's a few other coms and things coming up um we can talk about I feel like I'm     
1:47:13     
kind of interjecting that so I don't know how much we wanted to say well I think     
1:47:19     
uh you know that's something that uh like I don't know i mean     
1:47:25     
awesome it's a couple weeks and they usually want a full paper so I wouldn't     
1:47:30     
want to like uh you know I don't think we can do anything i don't think we have     
1:47:36     
anything submit right and that's that's kind of what I was thinking but like I     
1:47:41     
know I haven't been around but uh I might I don't know um I     
1:47:48     
might do something with the program committee there or something because I I was following up on something i don't I     
1:47:54     
don't know if I'll say about it right now um but more so uh yeah I didn't I     
1:47:59     
didn't have a sense of like um I didn't know a paper we had ready     
1:48:06     
this year either but I know I've been away     
1:48:11     
um there are a few other conferences I think I'll     
1:48:16     
just post them in in the slide one was     
1:48:22     
about one of them Uh one was actually about something     
1:48:28     
about gaming or gaming     
1:48:36     
um oh um there's one uh cooperative AI which is in     
1:48:45     
Turkey that's about a call for practitioners and researchers so if     
1:48:50     
anyone's doing um     
1:48:55     
I don't know about Okay there there's one I'll post in the chat too about     
1:49:03     
um the one this is one I was interactive games and postgraduate research conference     
1:49:09     
um that's the submission deadline's a ways away later in May and     
1:49:17     
um like mental health and gaming things like that I'll try to I'll I'll post I'll post this in Slack right now but     
1:49:25     
um I was thinking I don't think Pain's here but um like for like board games VR     
1:49:32     
or like interactive play it just seems like there's stuff there so if that's interesting I know we're not really     
1:49:38     
doing play in the lab right now but um plot twist is essentially based about     
1:49:47     
all about that and we were at the inclusive gaming conference last year and there's also a sort of a data and     
1:49:54     
direction actual tiein someone at UCSD uh was featured for some research on     
1:50:02     
using gains as ways to basically train or and not train but evaluate     
1:50:08     
um certain models so I don't know like specifically I don't know the details     
1:50:13     
right now but using using games as a as a like like computer games or video game     
1:50:20     
in this case um as a way to test for certain things um there there's     
1:50:26     
something there that I might submit to the conference app um and that is a I     
1:50:33     
can't really I only have an image of it so I'll just I'm just gonna put it I'm just going to put it in     
1:50:43     
here i'm just putting it in the main one right now but um it's it's     
1:50:51     
a York St john University I guess um we have a few things there um there's     
1:51:00     
something else I want to say but I'm not able to i'll post I'll post things they     
1:51:06     
probably should be in the call for involvement one i'll post something recall for a moment um yeah sorry I'm really scared about     
1:51:13     
that is there outside of my own gibberish stuff is there anything else     
1:51:21     
that should be we should be paying attention to in a     
1:51:27     
directing people to work on it way outside of the big obvious thing which is the     
1:51:33     
summer that's obviously the main show for the next few months but All     
1:51:38     
right kind of working on for the Pika conference and things     
1:51:43     
but but you know that's kind of early stages um and then we have maybe some     
1:51:51     
other things this summer really on the schedule but yeah I should put together     
1:51:58     
like an action list or something because it' be kind of nice to have that     
1:52:04     
we have the sheet of submissions and things but you know that's there there     
1:52:09     
isn't that much to review right now so yeah yeah um and I like I don't like     
1:52:16     
um in terms of doing that or if you want to talk about anything else wise like     
1:52:23     
um let me know how I can best support that because I know I'm kind of coming in i have I have these other things here     
1:52:30     
and then I'm I'm trying to sort out like what um what if anything happen needs to     
1:52:37     
happen in a lab that I can facilitate um let me know a bit away about that but I'm here     
1:52:44     
to engage whatever I can now yeah I know     
1:52:52     
it's but congratulations on your completion of your program     
1:53:00     
i mean you you So you've got I guess you've got your degree already or Well I have I have the declaration from the     
1:53:08     
dean that I'm I'm valid like I got I'm sanctioned I'm sanctioned by the state     
1:53:18     
um I won't go there right now anyway um yeah I'm done i'm going to go to San     
1:53:25     
Diego unless I I it's been such a tough year because I heard the campus so many     
1:53:31     
things to be honest with you like it's been really I'm not going to talk about all the things going on but like you know um     
1:53:40     
I really really really intend to be in San Diego for graduation which is in June yeah and hey if anybody's watching     
1:53:48     
this in San Diego I'm trying to I'm trying I'm trying to make up for a lot     
1:53:54     
of missed connections and I'll I'll be there hopefully for more than a few days     
1:54:02     
and both be I like the for great memories there um as a town but then     
1:54:09     
actually doing more with the university this time that'll be in June so um thank     
1:54:15     
you for that Bradley and yeah like I'm kind of excited now because I feel like I'm kind of coming     
1:54:22     
I've been in a cage for like the better part of a year like seven to eight months i've just been I haven't had     
1:54:30     
freedom to do a lot of things I wanted to do when we had the question earlier uh     
1:54:36     
video as it's like um I kind of just dumped a lot of stuff     
1:54:43     
but like in particular it's like seven months of having to hold back on many     
1:54:50     
things um and then finally being done with grad school and being done with a     
1:54:56     
master's program being being done with that now and and a lot of other life     
1:55:02     
changes Um it's great     
1:55:07     
to I I don't know like a couple summers ago I remember I would go to the river and we'd have our Friday morning our     
1:55:14     
Friday call i was like I'm looking forward to that so much um with the projects and we go on the summer time to     
1:55:21     
kind of be more um robustly able to do things again is     
1:55:30     
great and so yeah um um in terms of other things like     
1:55:37     
future ahead ahead things coming our way there's that conference is another one     
1:55:44     
and um oh I need to check my email I don't expect but I got into     
1:55:50     
something but there might be a very fun um there's a few really interesting events coming up in the summer about     
1:55:58     
like AI and philosophy kind of stuff and then also some of the ecolapto I'll     
1:56:03     
try to post some of the stuff here that is sort of     
1:56:08     
um touring the country I suppose to to do certain finding spaces where we want     
1:56:15     
to talk about what what he wants to talk about what he wants to do so learn about them too there i don't really know how     
1:56:21     
to best talk about about the group here because it's not quite a lot of trles is     
1:56:26     
very much you know um we're designing a game or doing very specific stuff and uh     
1:56:37     
it's I I don't I don't feel comfortable like I'm work I'm with Echoto I guess     
1:56:45     
but also like I feel like I'm I'm a newly invited person there so I don't I don't quite know how to fully talk about     
1:56:51     
it but I think there'll be a lot of fun things there i would love to and I know Addie is very interested in some of the     
1:56:58     
leadership innovation stuff I'm talking about too so I think there'll be some really fun things there and um as a     
1:57:05     
general like thing like if people have a topic they'd like to see covered in data and direction or the leadership stuff or     
1:57:12     
early career folks have questions a lot of a lot of the articles I've put so far on the leadership from here to there     
1:57:19     
mentoring strategy and mentoring for innovation project blog substack a lot     
1:57:25     
of the articles there are literally just early career folks asking me questions about stuff and and me like yeah let's     
1:57:33     
let's just write something about this and and put it out there because they're valid questions and     
1:57:39     
um I think there's going to be more of that over the summer too anyway discussion series ahead     
1:57:45     
interviews ahead and then hopefully some conferences and definitely     
1:57:53     
um that sounds great thank you Jesse     
1:58:03     
so I wanted to get back to um So I wanted to get back to some of     
1:58:09     
the things uh in the Slack i know that Morgan's     
1:58:15     
talked about neuroscience networks so there's some things in     
1:58:21     
neuroscience networks that were posted some YouTube videos um this one here uh     
1:58:28     
on the use of quantum technologies in network neuroscience uh this one is graph 2 a     
1:58:34     
flexible open-source reproducible community oriented easy to use framework for     
1:58:41     
network analysis in neuroscience uh there's this video how     
1:58:47     
many types of causation should we consider in neuroscience this is the neuroscience and philosophy     
1:58:55     
uh this is beyond mechanism and extending causation this one is uh I guess a well     
1:59:03     
he post LinkedIn posts in their papers within it this is a network neuroscience     
1:59:09     
paper or perspective on translational network neuroscience nine roadblocks and     
1:59:16     
possible solutions this is definitely uh this is the open access journal network     
1:59:22     
neuroscience and this is just talking about translational network neuroscience     
1:59:27     
or ways to use network neuroscience in applied settings     
1:59:33     
um this one here revealing higher order neural representations regenerative artificial     
1:59:41     
intelligence uh we talked about like representations and artificial forms of     
1:59:48     
intelligence in in the past few meetings so they they kind of focus     
1:59:54     
on first order representations higher order     
1:59:59     
representations and then the in interaction between that's kind of an interesting paper um I would you might     
2:00:09     
we might go over the abstract actually so this is actually Megan Peters is on     
2:00:15     
this um as an author and this is um yeah     
2:00:21     
just okay so the abstract reads studies often aim to reveal how neural     
2:00:27     
representations code aspects of an observer's environment so we're talking about neural representations     
2:00:34     
um such as its contents or structure these are what they call first order representations or     
2:00:40     
FOSs because they're about the external world uh so you have like a first     
2:00:48     
starter representation that takes something in the external world and builds a model of it and internally it     
2:00:55     
may include certain details and may leave out other details and it's a first order representation because there's no     
2:01:03     
sort of uh you know it's not necessarily very symbolic it's just kind of like a parts     
2:01:10     
list or it's a correspondence map a less common target is higher order     
2:01:16     
representations or HOS which are about FORS so last time last time we talked     
2:01:22     
about metalarning last meeting and we talked about like all this you know there's all this work being done in     
2:01:28     
metalarning respect to basian uh approaches with respect to reinforcement     
2:01:35     
learning and all this other stuff and what they're doing here is they're just basically taking representations and     
2:01:40     
building these first order representations and proposing that you can build them as correspondence maps     
2:01:47     
and then have these HOS or higher order representations which are about the     
2:01:53     
first order representations so HS as opposed to being correspondence or being a model of     
2:02:01     
something in the world is a model of the contents stability and uncertainty of     
2:02:08     
those first order representations higher order representations of     
2:02:14     
uncertainty appear critically involved in adaptive behaviors including learning under uncertainty influencing learning     
2:02:22     
rates and internal model updating based on environmental feedback however higher     
2:02:28     
order uh representations about uncertainty are likely to be direct readouts of first order representation     
2:02:36     
characteristics so they're not like correspondence maps of the first order representations those might be like     
2:02:43     
second order representations so you could have a situation where you have like a first     
2:02:49     
order representation of this table in front with all the things on it of     
2:02:55     
interest and then I could make a correspondence map of that with the representation and then you know I'd     
2:03:01     
have that in my as my internal model it would be reduced in complexity it     
2:03:07     
would have like you know select selective features and then maybe have a     
2:03:12     
second order representation of that where I might have like a model of     
2:03:17     
motion where I have like the physics of things on the table so I have given a     
2:03:23     
model of the what's on the table then I have this model of physics or model of     
2:03:29     
motion that is second but that's not what we're talking about talking about higher order     
2:03:35     
representations where you have maybe a model of the uncertainty of that     
2:03:41     
representation or something else so um they're not readouts of F     
2:03:48     
characteristics uh higher order representations instead reflect estimation     
2:03:54     
processes which may be lossy biased or distorted so lossy means that it can     
2:04:02     
lose information that like you know you can encode something     
2:04:08     
uh in a way that loses information so there's lossless encoding which is where     
2:04:14     
you encode something without losing any information and then there's lossy     
2:04:19     
encoding which is where we lose information but not enough to you know     
2:04:24     
be disruptive but you may lose information that's necessary uh there also may be biasprone     
2:04:32     
encodings so those are where you encode things according to a certain bias in     
2:04:38     
the observer or distortive which means that there's noise involved in the that noise     
2:04:43     
corrupts this uh representation and which may also     
2:04:49     
incorporate estimations of distributions of uncertainty the observer is likely to experience so this     
2:04:56     
means that if like again we were talking about basian and likelihoods and things like that with respect to metal this is     
2:05:03     
where you have um you're basically estimating how uncertain something is or     
2:05:08     
an object so an object if I look at a cup on the table     
2:05:14     
um you know I may be uncertain as to whether it is a cup maybe something else it looks like or I may be uncertain as     
2:05:22     
to the physics how you know how likely is it that this cup will tip over or     
2:05:28     
that if I apply a certain force that it'll tip over and I can calculate uncertainty estimates for that and it's     
2:05:35     
all based on the observer and their experience if they're uh you know if the observer is experiencing something what     
2:05:42     
is that you it depends on the observer different observers are going to have different uh estimated distributions for     
2:05:50     
uncertainty and then of course in context so if I know the more I know about a certain setting the less     
2:05:57     
uncertain things are but not always because sometimes things are inherently uncertain and so we have to calculate     
2:06:05     
that well some research has targeted neural represent presentations of instantaneously estimated uncertainty uh     
2:06:13     
the brain represents uh distributions of expected uncertainty remains largely explored here we propose     
2:06:21     
a novel reinforcement learning based generative artificial intelligence approach to explore neural     
2:06:27     
representations and uncertainty distributions we use existing fMRI data where humans     
2:06:33     
learn to demo noise their brain states to achieve target neural patterns to train dnoising diffusion generative AI     
2:06:40     
models with reinforcement learning algorithms so noise distributions similar to how humans might learn to do     
2:06:47     
the same we then explore these models learn noise distribution     
2:06:53     
uh higher order representations compared to control models trained with traditional back     
2:06:59     
propagation results revealed model dependent differences in noise distribution representations with a     
2:07:05     
reinforce reinforcement based model uh offering much higher explanatory power     
2:07:11     
for human behavior offering an exciting path towards using generative AI to     
2:07:16     
explore normal noise distribution representations so again they're they're     
2:07:22     
making this connection between metalarning or these kind of meta     
2:07:28     
representations higher order representations and reinforcement learning which we've talked about is     
2:07:35     
something you can implement in the brain where people argument you can al argue that you can also implement basian     
2:07:41     
models in the brain so when you have feedback you can implement a basian     
2:07:47     
model but reinforcement learning is also feedback so these are you know     
2:07:54     
basically brain inspired in some ways you can link them to what's going on in     
2:07:59     
the neural anatomy what's going on in the brain activity all right so that's that paper     
2:08:06     
that's a really cool paper i like that this one translational network neuroscience is another good one uh     
2:08:12     
these videos are all good um there's some other videos they don't generate     
2:08:18     
the thumbnail sorry about that you'll just have to click through for those and we'll     
2:08:24     
explore uh there's this other meeting IT ICTS this is a meeting in     
2:08:31     
India this is a discussion meeting on neuroscience data science and dynamics     
2:08:37     
of dynamical systems um this is okay the touring lectures will be delivered by professor     
2:08:45     
Gabriel Minland from Buenus Aries the topic of the physics of bird     
2:08:50     
zone uh and so this is a turn     
2:08:55     
lecture and yeah so this is just kind of a you know Morgan will post different     
2:09:03     
snapshots of what's going on in the field that's one of them uh this is talk by Anthony Zador     
2:09:10     
from Michael Leven's YouTube channel uh from the conneto to AI and back     
2:09:16     
Anthony Zador of course has done a lot of work yeah he's different he's he's he     
2:09:21     
was involved or he's been involved in your own match that group so yeah he's     
2:09:27     
got some good ideas i checked that out and then of course this is the one that Morgan talked about with Zapench so     
2:09:34     
that was what he was talking about this is improving brain models is Zapbench this is a Google research     
2:09:41     
uh thing you have paper data sets code and tutorials um so this is where they're     
2:09:48     
working with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelli's farm and Harvard and     
2:09:55     
they've been working groups there and they introduced this tool called Zackbench a whole brain activity data     
2:10:03     
set benchmark with single cell resolution on the laral zebra fish so     
2:10:08     
this is the zebra fish brain here uh to enable the development and comparison of     
2:10:13     
more accurate brain activity so this is where Google's been     
2:10:18     
working on contoics brain connetoics and trying to improve our tools for this so in over     
2:10:27     
the years they've created uh maps in several species um they've worked on the     
2:10:33     
fly brain that's been uh reconstructed in you know in in     
2:10:38     
collaboration with Janellia Farm they've been working on different parts of the fly brain so they've worked on the     
2:10:44     
mushroom bodies and some other regions of the fly um but these structural maps     
2:10:49     
can only take us so far so you have these connetos where you're looking at connections between neurons uh like in     
2:10:57     
the fly brain they worked on high resolution imaging where they've been able to take a a connections between the neurons     
2:11:06     
and visualize those and gain a an appreciation for the contoics of uh     
2:11:14     
versus so you know this is scale it's several thousand neurons so we you know     
2:11:20     
it's it's a long haul to getting to humans it's also a long haul to getting to like a working model of the brain it     
2:11:28     
can generate behaviors that are just like uh the organism that it's model so     
2:11:34     
we have these structural maps we can recapitulate all the connections we can't necessarily know how the     
2:11:40     
connections are used or you know the context in which they're used what behaviors are generated necessarily     
2:11:47     
sometimes you have uh specific circuits where you have a pretty good idea of the     
2:11:53     
behaviors that are generated but in something like a fly brain you can't know like in the mushroom bodies for     
2:11:59     
example what combination of specific connections are activated to produce     
2:12:05     
specific things and maybe we'll never know that but we would like to have a better idea     
2:12:12     
what those look like so um you know we can do things like     
2:12:18     
record large scale brain activity and develop models from these observations but it's hard to kind of     
2:12:24     
make a a really strong connection between these maps and then things like     
2:12:31     
behavior or functional activity to bridge that limitation um we     
2:12:38     
required a whole brain data set of the larville zebra fish brain which um you     
2:12:43     
know there are a lot of nice developmental data sets of zebra fish because it's a mild organism people     
2:12:49     
worked on the embryology of and the laral development of different stages of laral development it's very fascinating     
2:12:56     
organism and it's even more complex than what we find in uh the fruitfly or soft     
2:13:06     
And it's it's closer to a mamalian brain in the sense that it's a vertebrae so we have that three lobe     
2:13:12     
structure you know kind of make more connections to the human brain this     
2:13:17     
way this data sets features recordings of roughly 70,000 neurons we are in the     
2:13:23     
process of generating a comprehensive conneto for the specimen for which the activity data was reported this unique     
2:13:30     
combination will for the first time allow us to directly investigate the relationship between the precise     
2:13:36     
structural wiring and dynamic patterns and activity across an entire vertebrate     
2:13:42     
brain so we have a vertebrate brain that is tractable to this type of analysis and so the zap bench refers to     
2:13:50     
zebra fish activity prediction benchmark so this is the zap zebra fish activity     
2:13:56     
prediction then the bench is benchmark so this is actually something they announced at     
2:14:02     
ICOR um with the Zapbench open source data set researchers have detailed reportings they can use to build models     
2:14:09     
of brain activity and using the benchmark they can quantify the accuracy of     
2:14:15     
predictive so we talk about benchmarking brain models here um we talk about datadriven     
2:14:22     
benchmarks in machine learning this has driven progress of weather forecasting     
2:14:28     
computer vision and language modeling there's an existing effort called the dynamic sensorium     
2:14:35     
competition which has improved our understanding of how most visual cortex processes visual     
2:14:41     
stimuli but this only covers in fact less than 0.1% of the mouse brain so this is a     
2:14:48     
very very small area of the mouse brain doing what it does and we can benchmark     
2:14:54     
it accordingly and but in um Zapbench they are basically doing almost the     
2:15:00     
entire brain of all of the disease so this dynamic     
2:15:06     
sensorium is this is the p the archive paper um there's a group here that has     
2:15:12     
done this the dynamic sensorium competition for predicting large scale mouse visual cortex activity for videos     
2:15:20     
so basically they they have videos that they show to the mouse they record from     
2:15:26     
the visual cortex and then they can make these predictions and then use that as a     
2:15:31     
set of benchmarks so it's really interesting work if we go up to     
2:15:38     
um this paper that they have here this is Zapbench a benchmark for     
2:15:44     
whole brain activity prediction in zebra fish this is the group of researchers here     
2:15:50     
and again they get they they kind of go over everything from this uh promotional     
2:15:55     
post for this paper and then the data sets codes and tutorial this is the Zapbench     
2:16:02     
uh data set of data sets they have volutric activity segmentation     
2:16:09     
uh traces for segmented neuron and then cell activity which renders activity     
2:16:15     
traces to visualize spatial relationships these traces are then mapped onto a volutric model of the brain where     
2:16:23     
you have the activity and the segmentations they segmentate segment out the neurons and they map the traces     
2:16:30     
to that cell activity and then this is uh some of the interactive results they just show like     
2:16:36     
um for different behavioral contexts they have like these different or or     
2:16:42     
different contexts in in the data set they have these different aspects of     
2:16:47     
gain dots flash turning so they have like all     
2:16:53     
these different things that happen in behavior um like taxis are these quick     
2:16:59     
movements towards a stimulus flash and I guess presenting a flash     
2:17:05     
stimulus turning position open loop rotation dark you     
2:17:11     
have to go to the manuscript to know what these baselines are but these are the benchmarks for these different     
2:17:16     
things so that's the idea what they want to get it's graphs that show kind of a baseline and then you know you can use     
2:17:25     
uh you can look across different systems within zebra fish or maybe proficial systems like     
2:17:32     
artificial embods for so they have code and tutorials here     
2:17:38     
interactive time series forecasting metrics printing evaluation and data     
2:17:45     
sets so I think that's all for today uh thank you for     
2:17:51     
attending and have a good evening thank you very much thank you bye bye

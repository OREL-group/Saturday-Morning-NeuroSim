Hello. Uh, welcome to Saturday morning neurosen. Uh, we haven't had a meeting in a couple    
0:06    
weeks and I wanted to have an update go through kind of a one meeting uh with    
0:12    
readings with have any discussion. I'm going to be the only one here but going    
0:17    
through different features like we would in a regular meeting. So the first thing I wanted to give is an update. So, our    
0:26    
Google Summer of Code Scholars are hard at work. They're working on their projects.    
0:32    
Um, we're now in week seven of the program and um several weeks into the coding period and they've been turning    
0:39    
out great code. Uh we have Dei who's working on the open-source sustainability project and    
0:46    
she's been populating her repository with uh her project that    
0:51    
involves agent-based modeling and reinforcement learning. She's using the SARSA approach    
0:58    
and you know coming up with some really good metrics for measuring a lot of this    
1:04    
and so this is um you know coming along pretty quickly. I'm very impressed. uh    
1:09    
Leith uh from the Divor group is working on DVO graph and he's also been pushing    
1:18    
his code to the repository and he's been working on hyperraphs    
1:23    
specifically different formulations of hyperraphs building visualizations of hyperraphs    
1:31    
and mapping that to the biology which I think is also very important    
1:37    
our other GOC scholar also involved in div    
1:43    
project is Giadrotha. Girotha has been graduating from his    
1:48    
graduate program. So he's been a little behind our other two scholars but he's still    
1:54    
working on this model of temporal hypographs. And so he's been also contributing to    
2:01    
the repository. He's been building visualizations, nice visualizations of    
2:07    
these temporal hyperraphs and the temporal structure of development in    
2:12    
particular and him and Lilith have been working on    
2:17    
different aspects of the biology. So this is going to be a nice addition to    
2:23    
dboorm as a pro as a group but also the do graph project.    
2:31    
So that's you know what our Google summer of code scholars have been up to.    
2:37    
Uh this week we had two meetings. The first was uh the debour meeting. We usually have that on Mondays and we    
2:44    
talked about a number of topics. Uh we picked some papers from our collaborators,    
2:50    
one on muscle cell growth. Um and we also did some things on    
2:57    
developmental mechanics kind of link those together. Then we had a discussion on    
3:05    
some research that Lewith is doing with Richard Gordon on centum    
3:12    
and C elegance working out the lineage tree for the centishum.    
3:17    
Lineage tree typically bifurcates. But in the case of centishum or fuse cells    
3:22    
of normal tissue with multiple nuclei, they    
3:28    
reticulate. They merge back together. A lot of these cells fuse they come from    
3:33    
different parts of the lineage tree and they fuse together in one uh phenotypic    
3:38    
structure. So we talked about that. Uh I also talked about this article on lifelike    
3:46    
simulations. So lifelike simulations are lifelike simulations. They look like    
3:52    
life. They act like life, but they're not living systems. And more importantly,    
3:58    
you don't need to use a representation of any known living system to achieve it.    
4:04    
So if we think about systems like morphogenesis or systems like ant county    
4:11    
or systems like bird flocks those all have agents or some sort of biochemical    
4:19    
set of reactions behaviors generated by brains etc etc those are they have some    
4:25    
biological substrate or biochemical substrate. In the case of lifelike    
4:32    
simulations, you can simulate processes that look like those systems have a substrate, but you don't have to model    
4:38    
the substrate. You can model in fact with any generic mathematical model. And    
4:43    
this is the logic that Steven Wolf uses to make statements about nature using    
4:51    
cellular automa. In this case, they were working on a agent-based simulation    
4:58    
that looked like life. And you know, it's really hard to say what life looks like. You know, when you see it. You can    
5:05    
define different systems, emerging systems, uh percolating systems,    
5:12    
you know, systems that incorporate migration of particles or the    
5:18    
organization of particles, spontaneous organization. things like that and so usually we have    
5:26    
a set of conditions for lifelike simulations and I talk about that in    
5:33    
okay the other meeting we had was on Friday that was the open source meeting that we usually have we had our Google    
5:41    
somewhere code updates and then we had a nice discussion by Morgan on the things    
5:48    
he's been involved with of biorinting organoids and building tissues and doing tissue    
5:55    
culture and ending up with something approximating a customized organoid    
6:02    
with a customized form and a customized biology. And so he's been uh going to workshops,    
6:10    
going to online workshops and person workshops and exploring this concept with a number of labs and trying to    
6:18    
figure out the way forward on this. It's really exciting. And then Jesse of course um he's    
6:25    
involved in he's he's doing this micro MBA and he's doing um some interesting    
6:31    
things in organizational research and project management which is    
6:37    
one of his specialty areas and then myself I presented on something called    
6:42    
openw washing which is where people present projects as open source but    
6:48    
they're not actually open source uh at least in the conventional sense that say like a free and open source software or    
6:55    
a foss organization would present it. And so this was an interesting    
7:00    
discussion on you know how materials are open, how they're transparent, the    
7:07    
licensing terms by which they're released and of course the organization itself. what are their goals and what    
7:14    
are their you know how do they envision these materials being used versus how the    
7:21    
contributors do. So there a lot of opportunities there but also a lot of    
7:26    
points to be made for not being totally honest about those aligning those goals.    
7:34    
Okay. So that's it for this week um in terms of updates.    
7:40    
Oh, hi. How are you? I I lost track of time    
7:47    
trying to build Copy 3D. Oh, their um    
7:53    
their Python day. They're gonna do their    
7:59    
summer school like end of July. Oh, yeah.    
8:17    
Yeah. So, I'm in Ren, Virginia. Oh, yeah. That's great. So, you were at the    
8:24    
workshop or you uh I mean, I was left left uh like late    
8:32    
Thursday night and came back here because My younger kids are here with my    
8:38    
brother's kids. So, it's cousin C. Yeah.    
8:45    
My parents    
8:53    
really really remarkable.    
8:59    
Yeah. like like    
9:04    
this is a way to build microfitic systems, right?    
9:11    
With benefits, right? Like like so it's like you one the    
9:19    
equipment is inexpensive, right? So it's just like it's a modification of standard consumer 3D    
9:27    
printer. uh uh two    
9:33    
you print in a bath.    
9:38    
Um so that's what they what they're calling fresh printing    
9:44    
and it's free form reversible    
9:50    
something something something. Um    
9:56    
but the point being that like You're you're choosing    
10:01    
a hydrogel where when you extrude into it,    
10:08    
it it keeps that shape. So this is like the hydrogel    
10:14    
the hydrogel moves for whatever you've extruded,    
10:22    
but then it keeps it keeps that material. So it's just like you're printing in this kind of semiolid path    
10:32    
like like you don't you don't have to rely on gravity or basically gravity    
10:38    
doesn't hold back. So you can print in 3D    
10:43    
by moving your syringe point    
10:49    
to wherever you want. So, so you go through and you can print    
10:56    
these super accurate, super, you know, intricate uh shapes in this    
11:04    
gel and it and it holds that for right.    
11:10    
Yeah. And then you just you can later heat up    
11:15    
the then you put it in the ink and the gel melts    
11:22    
and then it's just like and then you get your you get whatever you printed    
11:28    
I mean and then maybe you've got to do some extra washes    
11:37    
but then what's Cool. So we we we did the    
11:43    
you know this was just tests was really about kind of about the print printer    
11:49    
conversion in some degree like fresh printing    
11:55    
uh you know by printing in this gel. But the first boling was this algae    
12:02    
and it was really just to you know print something else something other than what we into the bath.    
12:11    
But then the second stage is using what they call chips which is this collagen based    
12:18    
profusible scaffold and now imagine where you know    
12:28    
you see these kind of microfed chips.    
12:35    
There's couple couple examples that I think are maybe good to look at about    
12:41    
just micrfluidics, but one of those is using micrfluidics for a for a mixing    
12:48    
process. So, we've got two two inlets,    
12:54    
separate, you know, what will be separate materials    
12:59    
and then they come together and then you say they may snake back and forth, what    
13:04    
they call pattern and then one out.    
13:11    
So people will use this both to    
13:17    
model physiological channels but also just by putting in two    
13:23    
things they're actually doing and and one example of that is actually    
13:30    
lipid nano particle fabrication. So you can have DNA and and lipids and    
13:41    
get encapsulation in the mixing just as an example. But in this case,    
13:47    
the the main thing is that like instead of doing kind of cool fabrication these    
13:54    
mic these microtic chips    
14:00    
you're doing fresh printing. to do this this this printing in a bath    
14:06    
using collagen. You can print something that looks    
14:14    
in gel looks plastic in the sense of like super well defined.    
14:23    
But now if you melt it, I mean even even when it's just melted    
14:30    
and still kind of in the gel solution, you can see when you just tap it that    
14:36    
the collagen is super super soft and super    
14:44    
I guess the technical term would be fluffy. I don't know. I don't know what the Um,    
14:53    
but it's really interesting because    
15:00    
you you can still use it in that kind of micrfluidic way,    
15:07    
right? In the sense that like there's there is an extra step in terms of just how do you how do you interface with    
15:14    
tubes, right? because it's so because it's so soft material, you can't    
15:22    
just jam a, you know, plastic pipe into these things.    
15:27    
So, there's there's an extra piece to make for the for the two inlets    
15:34    
and outlets in terms of how to interface, you know, your paras pumps, right? But    
15:41    
but but again this is kind of a feature not a bug    
15:47    
because what that allows you to do is again the the the softness is because    
15:56    
you've printed collagen and and so you've got a biomeaterial    
16:04    
that that you can either see    
16:09    
so you can actually create a cell bio that that prints with the collagen,    
16:18    
right? So in that case like your your material    
16:24    
already contains cells or you can profuse cells    
16:31    
through this microfit    
16:37    
collagen platform. Yeah. And and and get that kind of, you know,    
16:45    
wall base, you know, like like covering the channels, things like that.    
16:52    
So, you know, again, like like one of the    
16:58    
Yeah, I I would love it. I mean,    
17:03    
I get why they're saying like like we're doing, you know, they're always    
17:08    
like we're doing this as a service to the open source community like we're teaching we're teaching this thing    
17:15    
because I was just like you need to do like a two day workshop platforms    
17:21    
and they're they're like I think you misunderstand why    
17:29    
we don't have a grant to teach this right I think was kind of their point    
17:36    
and That's okay. That that that to me is    
17:41    
just an opportunity and that because I said, you know, this is uh I    
17:50    
think a really unersold or or I didn't appreciate it as until I    
17:59    
got there and saw, you know, their applications of it as as well as like    
18:06    
hearing people talking about where it's just like there are actual limitations    
18:11    
to the current fabrication technologies    
18:17    
in that you you you are making these these    
18:23    
loaded platforms from these these kind of artificial materials    
18:30    
specifically because most of them are used for drug studies right and they don't want the drugs to seep    
18:37    
into the Oh, okay. So, so like like they don't they they    
18:45    
they're kind of like artificial to preserve    
18:52    
to to to make the system simpler. Um but but it also makes them less    
19:01    
realistic. Right. Right. Or less less accurate.    
19:06    
Uh Yeah. And and so    
19:13    
it it was super interesting. I mean again like I'd love more    
19:22    
expert background in micros. I mean, you know, the other funny thing showing up at this was was coming with    
19:31    
to, you know, like like one we were,    
19:36    
you know, so everybody was just like    
19:44    
and yeah, so trying to explain to them what a community science lab is.    
19:49    
Yeah. Uh but the the other was that like    
19:55    
you know that everybody else showing up like either sort of had a connection to    
20:01    
this lab. It was basically this was a workshop that they were doing for their    
20:06    
collaborators. Oh okay. you know, so it's just like it was like a lot of groups in Pittsburgh    
20:14    
that are like neurosurgery or other, you    
20:20    
know, other departments outside, right? So it's like it's like these guys are    
20:26    
bioe the other groups were like the applications people right from    
20:33    
dermatology you know pulmonary uh    
20:40    
liver you know like all these different super interesting one that was focused    
20:46    
on cyia and    
20:51    
yeah it It's it's    
21:00    
nobody was doing neurons. Yeah. Except you know, you know, the one group    
21:08    
that looks it's coming from a kind of neural translational engineering    
21:16    
lab. Um definitely had a lot of experience with that. think you know    
21:22    
culturing your a lot of experience doing rat surgeries things like that    
21:29    
and and they were just like yeah neuronal culture is the hardest    
21:36    
and and you know but I think they understood that like yeah if you can get    
21:42    
that to work that you really have a super interesting opportunity in terms    
21:50    
of the kind of the kind of constructs that are possible    
21:56    
with this. So the way in which I mean the cultures    
22:04    
will be fundamentally different from 2D neural culture    
22:10    
and and you know and you can    
22:19    
new territory is the other other and certainly    
22:25    
the bye you know the CM Bio groups that did this    
22:33    
certainly see how this can play into kind of like shaping ordinary culture    
22:41    
potential and just    
22:46    
very very exciting. Yeah. Well, that sounds good. Yeah. I'm glad to hear a little bit more about    
22:52    
that. And uh    
22:58    
I I don't know. Uh I guess it's it's very experimental. It sounds like it's not like they've really kind of gotten    
23:05    
outside of their local experimentation and stuff like that. But    
23:11    
yeah, but they're they're you know like like    
23:16    
at the same time they're far along with muscle with    
23:23    
cardiac tissue. They're far along with epidermis    
23:32    
pancreas. Uh    
23:38    
like like bone plus muscle plus skin.    
23:44    
Um you know vessels, you know, both both blood vessels and um    
23:54    
and heart pumps, heart valves.    
23:59    
uh you know it there's definitely an emphasis    
24:06    
on kind of like muscle skeletal you know um    
24:11    
as they point out like this you know it's the largest organ in the body    
24:19    
you know so so you know there's kind of a reason for that I mean it's definitely    
24:26    
partly a kind of like ease You know, it's like it is, you know, ease easier.    
24:33    
You know, it's not easy, but it's it's certain things that they can, you know,    
24:41    
again, like muscle just being these things where they can almost protein    
24:48    
and and yeah, so they're they're far along.    
24:53    
And there's the other interesting Anyway, it    
24:59    
was also great because they they could really give us a breakdown of like who's    
25:05    
doing anything else. Yeah.    
25:10    
And connecting us with some great great people in the Bay Area.    
25:16    
Okay. So, that's exciting. And and there's there's groups there both doing like    
25:24    
printer development. um uh with some other kind of features that    
25:32    
are interesting and accessible for the kind of thing we can do at the tower. Um as well as like you know the center for    
25:39    
cellular construction that's like definitely you know pushing every single    
25:45    
kind of synthetic biology direction.    
25:50    
So yeah it's it's experimental but like outside of the brain, there's a lot of    
25:58    
there's a like a lot of activity and a lot of like successes,    
26:05    
you know, like people people getting lab on a chip stuff done, right?    
26:10    
Um and and you know, like I think we've talked about before like lab on a chip    
26:18    
seems to be the way to do you know the way that people are doing new stuff.    
26:24    
Yeah. Um and you know we said we there was a lot of joke about    
26:31    
how with the crumbling American democracy um    
26:37    
there is a funding opportunity for alternatives to animal testing.    
26:42    
Yeah. I'm not saying it's a silver lining, right?    
26:48    
Um but uh these these are these are people who are well positioned for    
26:56    
like like you know if there's a demand for like at least an alternative plan for for animal    
27:04    
testing like these are the these are the kind of you know this is the kind of    
27:10    
technology. I like that how this combines 3D    
27:16    
printing with cell culture with tissue engineering and then gives you that soft material    
27:23    
kind of platform to work with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, like    
27:28    
like then just uh coming on the off the back of that um and and doing some some    
27:37    
research on the way home, you know, it's like it's no surprise that some of the    
27:43    
best, you know, kind of similar work that I saw    
27:50    
um bio printing was coming from soft robotics lab at SER. you know,    
27:57    
like like so definitely    
28:04    
Yeah. Yeah. There's there's    
28:11    
a lot of overlap there. Um and and I    
28:16    
love that that Kleinberg just came from he said the most interesting conference    
28:21    
that he's been to uh recently was the biohybrid    
28:27    
um it was like biohybrid robotics meeting and that's where he met Michael    
28:33    
Le and and when he saw this is the other cool thing is that you know he saw the    
28:40    
bot stuff and he was just like hey this is very similar to what we're doing    
28:48    
with 3D printing and cell you know and and you know so like like    
28:54    
they're because they're a deep cell culture group like they already work    
29:00    
with embryos for other reasons you know and so you know he and I ended up    
29:07    
talking late at dinner and you know like like how    
29:14    
how kind of like the anchor box and and like how accessible that equip    
29:22    
is and yeah.    
29:29    
So yeah, all all the all the complexity    
29:35    
now lies with the    
29:40    
the self. I mean it's just like like you still have to nail the    
29:47    
right that's that's the small that's the small pipe that's also the expensive    
29:54    
or you know the expenses expenses you know talking to a guy    
30:01    
that really was like the the brains behind the the uh the 3D printer kind of    
30:10    
you know jailbreaking in conversion. Um like    
30:16    
his lab costs I mean so so he he confirmed that like    
30:21    
his biggest lab setup cost was was microscopes    
30:28    
right and his biggest recurring cost is cell culture reagents    
30:34    
right you know it's just like like that's that's you know after people that's    
30:44    
Which again, these aren't these aren't surprises, but I was just trying to get that across at the lab in San Francisco,    
30:51    
but like like we need to fund raise for microscopes because it's like that's    
30:57    
it's just really hard to do for less than like 100k, right?    
31:03    
And and we've got to finish our PSL 2, you know, which    
31:10    
incomplete doesn't mean that you can actually nail    
31:18    
and and that you know stem cells for neuronal differentiation    
31:26    
the most notoriously hard ones to tackle.    
31:31    
But that just one final thing just was really interesting and and exciting in    
31:37    
terms of also how a lot of these groups are    
31:42    
integrating both synthetic biology and and genetic    
31:48    
modifications. So, so    
31:54    
a keynote that they brought in from the outside from Penn State    
32:00    
obviously. Oh yeah. The other thing is that almost all these guys also have    
32:05    
this is like like they all certainly see I mean the organoid people are just as    
32:12    
bad, right? Uh so I I get it like they all see    
32:20    
they all see a commercial future for this right or you know they they all see it to some    
32:28    
degree I can't blame any academic for thinking that they should be starting a company these days just because you know    
32:36    
because of funding but but I think they all see    
32:42    
the the commercial potential and and feel like they should be taking    
32:49    
out patents and, you know, getting getting a commercial entity lined up to    
32:56    
to be a vehicle for this.    
33:02    
Um, yeah. So, diving diving out into    
33:08    
um, you know, IPSC of    
33:16    
helpful protocols and techniques to make it    
33:23    
potentially doable in a low resource community by laborator    
33:31    
but feeling really good about the printing and what that you know kind of    
33:37    
like the features that that offers. Oh, great. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I    
33:42    
wanted to go over some papers and things like that. They're kind of a that's a tangential    
33:48    
um turn from like what we're talking about here, but uh    
33:54    
they have some interesting things in the queue. We haven't gotten together in a while. So, actually this paper is maybe    
34:01    
somewhat related. It's not really that related, but it's something new by it's a review by Adam    
34:08    
Saffron, Inus Hippolito, and Andy Clark. And this is Frontiers in Neuroo.    
34:15    
Um, and this is on it's an editorial. I think it's a special issue    
34:22    
uh bio from embodied cognition to inactive robots.    
34:27    
So, you know, this is where they're thinking about and activism, embodiment,    
34:35    
um, intelligence, dynamical systems, robotics, and putting all that together kind of a    
34:42    
theoretical framework. So, it's not, you know, this kind of uh, biodvelopment of    
34:48    
robots, it's this sort of theoretical aspect of it. So, why don't we go through this?    
34:57    
So there's an introduction here where there's an Emily Dickinson poem talking about the brain    
35:04    
and um then uh they talk they start in if the connections of the human brain    
35:10    
were disentangled and placed into a sequence they would indeed be wider than    
35:15    
the sky being hundreds of kilometers long and likely capable of stretching to the moon and back. big reference wider    
35:22    
than the sky in this um poem.    
35:27    
Uh if we consider the kinds of intelligence generated by brain body environment systems then such emergent    
35:34    
minds may be vast still in terms of their complex combinatorics with the pinnacle of expressive power    
35:41    
potentially being found in language with its infinite use of finite means.    
35:48    
And this is just kind of the sort of generativity of language. That's what this refers to. The field of artificial    
35:55    
intelligence and machine learning AI/ML seeks to reproduce the powers of    
36:00    
biological learners where we struggle to recapitulate the ways in which even supposedly simple animals demonstrate    
36:08    
the ability to respond flexibly to a wide range of situations.    
36:13    
In this research topic, we were grateful to receive a diverse assortment of articles that address ways in which    
36:20    
principles of inactivism and embodied cognition might allow for advances in    
36:25    
AI/ML potentially without requiring explicit representations,    
36:31    
prespecified algorithms or centralized control structures. What follows? We    
36:38    
briefly summarize these contributions, highlight some potential implications    
36:43    
and end with the discussion of potential ways forward for AI/ML    
36:48    
and cognitive science more generally. So there are a whole bunch of papers in this collection. I think I remember    
36:54    
seeing a solicitation for this and it may have grown out of the out of a    
36:59    
collection from the embodied intelligence workshop I think about two years ago. I think they were soliciting    
37:06    
for this um issue and then another issue    
37:12    
um at the same time. So this was I think the one that they solicited that is    
37:17    
frontiers of neur robotics and I think we decided not to do that because of the cost of a publishing an    
37:24    
article. So this is uh they kind of go through the different articles in the special    
37:30    
issue. So the first one is the acquisition of culturally patterned attention styles under active inference.    
37:38    
That's by Axel constant at all. So if we go to that paper,    
37:44    
here's this paper here. Um Andy Clark is on this paper, Axel Constant,    
37:52    
and some other people. Um so this is an active inferencebased    
37:58    
simulation study of visual foraging. The goal of the simulation is to show the effect of the acquisition of    
38:04    
culturally patterned attention styles on cognitive task performance under active    
38:10    
influence. We show a cultural artifacts like antique base decorations drive cognitive    
38:17    
functions such as perception, action, and learning as well as task performance in a simple visual discrimination task.    
38:25    
We then describe a new act of inference-based research pipeline that future work may employ to inquire on    
38:32    
deep guiding principles determining the manner in which material culture drives human thought by building and rebuilding    
38:39    
our patterns of attention. It's pretty interesting paper. Um so that's the first one.    
38:48    
Second one is enacting plant inspired robotics. This is Lean Calvo and this is    
38:53    
where they look at plants as a holistic source of inspiration for soft robotics    
38:58    
in terms of their nonentralized modular architectures and highly plastic phenotypes. This was something that I    
39:05    
saw actually at the embodied intelligence workshop like two years ago. They were showing their work. They    
39:11    
were it was basically uh something they call robots    
39:16    
which you see here. So this is where you basically build an agent that acquires    
39:24    
sources of matter and energy and puts them into growth or growing a phenotype.    
39:31    
And so they have this whole area that they're kind of pioneering robots    
39:37    
and then they get into the what happens when you're growing your phenotype in    
39:42    
sighting. So you have uh so in contrast with notions of    
39:48    
autonomy based on the independent operability of systems over an observation window, plants and other    
39:55    
living organisms exhibit a stronger form of autonomous functioning in terms of needing to support self-p production    
40:02    
dynamics that create distinctions between themselves in the domain of interactions that maintain the    
40:08    
conditions of viability for the system. So that's u work on plants and but it's    
40:16    
also that kind of work where you want to grow a robotic system and you want to    
40:22    
have a system that um you know can be plastic can have these modular    
40:28    
architectures very different from sort of an animal inspired    
40:33    
uh or or in a lot of cases mamalian inspired robotic system.    
40:40    
Uh this is another one carving up participation sense making and sociomorphing for    
40:46    
artificial minds. Uh this is on social cognition    
40:51    
and uh participatory sense making. Uh this one embodied object    
40:58    
representation, learning and recognition shows how robotics can be informed by considering the ways in which biological    
41:06    
agents achieve scene understanding or adaptive object manipulation    
41:11    
and navigation capabilities by leveraging active interactions with the world in their first encounters with    
41:18    
novel situations. Uh this is inspired by neuroscience    
41:24    
theories in which neoccortical columns build predictive models about objects    
41:29    
within alocentric reference frames and this is what they call the cortical    
41:34    
column network architecture or CCN architecture. So I don't think this is the um the    
41:42    
group um the pneumment group. I think this is a    
41:48    
different group that they're kind of focusing on the same idea. Yeah. I mean I was definitely I mean in    
41:54    
my head I was just like that does sound like thousands. Yeah. Yeah.    
41:59    
But who's vandal? Vanderale. So this paper has Yeah.    
42:08    
Trun Vander for verbalin. Yeah. Okay.    
42:14    
But verbal CMU, right? So, yeah.    
42:20    
So, so it's like a bunch of G people plus Tim. Yeah.    
42:26    
Oh, I see there's someone from New who reviewed it. Super tight.    
42:32    
Yeah. Well, I guess it was good enough for them. So, I guess review.    
42:38    
Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's funny.    
42:45    
But Yeah. Okay.    
42:50    
Yeah. And again, this is on these kind of cortical column networks.    
42:56    
Um, and it's it's based in the visual system. So, you're trying to again do visual perception.    
43:03    
Um, and you know, this is pattern recognition just a little bit different way than    
43:09    
we're used to with neural networks.    
43:15    
So that and then um there's this next paper grounding context in embodied    
43:20    
cognitive robotics. This describes how autonomous machines may be augmented with greater behavioral    
43:27    
flexibility by providing systems with a global context that integrates agent    
43:33    
related environmental and task related information. Through the interaction of these core    
43:39    
elements, agents are capable of three things.    
43:45    
The first is selecting self-relevant tasks on the basis of current and anticipated future needs. This could be    
43:52    
for say like learning or mastering contingencies. Second is performing tasks within    
43:58    
continuous performance monitoring. And then three abandoning unsuccessful    
44:04    
tasks based in overall prediction errors during situated action cycles.    
44:11    
So this is uh you know the kind of how they think about grounding which is a    
44:18    
classic theme in cognitive science. Um and so uh that's that's this paper    
44:25    
and then the next paper is the problem of meaning the free energy principle artificial agency. This is Julius    
44:32    
Kristine at all described how biological agents solve the problem of meaning by    
44:39    
acting in ways that express sensitivity to context dependent relevance. Um so this is very similar uh in term    
44:48    
but this is cast in an activist framework. The authors argue that robustly    
44:53    
autonomous agents require stable self- sustaining patterns of sensory motor    
44:58    
interaction around values, norms, and goals as they encounter different    
45:05    
and differently meaningful environments. So they talk about inactivism as well as    
45:10    
the free energy principle including the challenge that these perspectives are fundamentally    
45:16    
incompatible with biological systems exhibiting historical path dependent learning but    
45:23    
with free energy minimizing agents preserve or ser severing this historicity.    
45:29    
So free energy minimization is where you're uh selecting from an ensemble    
45:36    
you know and then you're optimizing for the um I guess the the minimal or    
45:44    
maximum as opposed to biological systems where you have this historical path dependence    
45:51    
meaning that the thing that came before influences the thing that comes next. So it's uh you know    
45:59    
free energy principle. You could think of it as sort of being argotic or something like that versus like    
46:05    
historically contingent. Uh okay. Uh such free energy principle    
46:12    
agents also show a lack of interactional asymmetry present in an activist account    
46:17    
of autonomy. uh in these fundamental art.    
46:23    
Um in addition to addressing these challenges, it is suggested that rather than fundamental incompatibility,    
46:29    
the free energy principle needs inactivism for the problem of meaning and inactivism needs the free energy    
46:36    
principle for precise formal modeling the necessary constituent factors for realizing agency.    
46:43    
So a lot of stuff there on an activism for energy principle perhaps reconciling    
46:48    
them and then reconciling that with cognitive science    
46:54    
and you know seeing where the sort of the connections are.    
47:00    
Okay. So the next paper is avoiding catastrophe active dendrites enable    
47:06    
multitask learning in dynamic environments and this is IR at all. Um this is where    
47:14    
they introduce a neural network architecture for enhancing the embodied systems to operate in dynamic    
47:20    
environments while flexibly adapting at changing task contexts and continuously    
47:26    
learning without catastrophic forgetting/influence. So this is uh where they're trying to    
47:33    
overcome or or make the system robust to catastrophic forgetting. A lot of times you'll get this if you change task uh    
47:41    
change tasks or task contexts. So you learn something in one context, you    
47:46    
switch to a different context and everything you've learned is now generalizable and you have to relearn everything. You    
47:54    
know, this is of course if you have a generalizable model, this isn't as much of a concern, but people have been    
47:59    
trying to figure out how to generalize from a training set for a long time. And    
48:05    
so one way around that maybe is to build a system that's robust to catastrophe.    
48:10    
And that's what they're doing here. Uh this is achieved by incorporating active dendrites and sparsity promoting local    
48:18    
inhibitory systems. So dynamically constraining and routing information in a context specific    
48:25    
manner. The architecture is tested on several benchmarks including a multitask    
48:31    
reinforcement learning environment which agents must solve a variety of    
48:36    
manipulation tasks such as metalarning in addition to a continual learning    
48:42    
setup in which task predictions change over the course of training which is reversal. So metalarning versus    
48:49    
reversal. In both simulations, the architecture developed overlapping at distinct sparse subnet networks that    
48:57    
mediated the fluid adaptation to multiple tasks with minimal forgetting,    
49:02    
providing for the first time a demonstration of high performance with respectable multitasking and continual.    
49:12    
This actually sounds like maybe some of the sort of broad outlines of what we're trying to do in the    
49:19    
um ever good regulator theorem paper at least thinking in terms of some of the    
49:24    
ways to think about learning and networks and regulation at least in the    
49:30    
EGRT paper regulation I use regulation here but yeah it's like this idea of solving    
49:38    
a or potentially solving a lot of the problems of modern machine learning with    
49:43    
some sort of newer paradigm experimental paradigm where you can get    
49:48    
different types of learning, different types of training regimens and it gives you these different um levels of    
49:55    
robustness in the system. So the next paper is in social neuroi    
50:02    
social interaction is the dark matter of AI. Bulota and Dumas introduce a three-axxis    
50:09    
framework for social learning and biologically inspired AI and uh I guess this is informed by the    
50:16    
free energy principle. So there are three of these. The first is brain    
50:22    
inspired models of cognitive architectures such as global workspace and attention    
50:28    
schema theories that bridge individual and social intelligence.    
50:34    
Two are dynamical systems perspectives for handling the inherently time dependent nature of cognition.    
50:41    
Then three is embodiment as a source of sophisticated communicative signals.    
50:47    
These social interactions are essential elements of advanced cognitive ability    
50:53    
yet remain underexplored in AI constituing dark matter with respect to    
50:58    
attempts to understand human human I guess like intelligence. So    
51:05    
basically animallike intelligence. Um, in light of this gap in our understanding, the authors review the    
51:11    
role of social learning in cognitive development and this new field of social neuro AAI.    
51:18    
Uh, then there's uh this other paper here, goal oriented behavior with a habit-based adaptive sensory motor map    
51:26    
network. And this goes through sort of this um goal orientation and then habit    
51:34    
and and again kind of going over how to implement a habit-based robot controller. It draws on an activist    
51:41    
principles to realize agency by an adaptive sensory motor map network architecture.    
51:49    
Uh this paper here in embodied intelligence smooth coping in the learning intelligent decision agent    
51:56    
cognitive architecture. Kron study at all describe how skillful    
52:02    
interactions may become habituated and ingrained through experience thereby placing less stress on cognitive load    
52:09    
relative to considered and deliberate thought and action. These are just things like walking, driving, skiing,    
52:18    
short order cooking, etc. And then this gets into some    
52:24    
philosophical uh literature, philosophical arguments    
52:30    
and then kind of thinking about this in terms of a theory.    
52:37    
Uh looks like uh Pikanini we know from the uh the discussions we had on the    
52:45    
brain as a computer and things like that. Uh he has a paper    
52:50    
in here situated neural representations solving the problems of content    
52:56    
where he argues that situated approaches to mind based on embodiment embedding    
53:02    
and action effect are deeply intertwined with neural representation with such a computational approach    
53:09    
requiring embodiment embedding and action and a effect at its very poor.    
53:16    
uh situatedness is suggested to be necessary to describe the adaptive shaping of computations in a number of    
53:24    
ways. Um this one here is an an activist    
53:29    
inspired mathematical model of cognition. Um this is where they look at sensory    
53:35    
motor cognition and model this using a deterministic    
53:41    
automa. Then there's this paper using inactive robotics to think outside of the problem    
53:48    
solving box how sensory motor contingencies constrain the forms of emergent autonomous habits.    
53:56    
Um and then this actually this is kind of interesting given what we were talking about earlier.    
54:03    
Um this suggests that AI ought to take inspiration from the precarious self-maintaining organization of living    
54:10    
systems. They demonstrate how robots controlled by Iterative deformable sensory motor medium    
54:17    
or DSM and realize a spontaneous emergence of organized ecology of habits    
54:23    
capable of reenacting adaptive behaviors with habits formed within modalities and    
54:29    
relatively greater similarity to habits across modalities.    
54:34    
And this is similar to observations of biological systems. Um, this talks uh, so I'm going to look    
54:42    
this paper up and we'll open it up    
54:47    
and this is uh, okay. So let's look at the    
54:53    
uh, abstract. Uh we suggest that the influence of    
54:59    
biology and biologically inspired robotics can be embraced at a deeper level than is typical if we adopt an    
55:06    
inactive approach that moves the focus of interest from how problems are solved, how    
55:12    
problems emerge in the first place. In addition to being inspired by mechanisms found in natural systems or by    
55:19    
evolutionary design principles directed at solving problems posited by the environment, we can take inspiration    
55:26    
from the precarious self-maintaining organization of living systems. We    
55:32    
investigate forms of cognition that are also precarious and self-maintaining and that thus also like life have their    
55:40    
own problems that must be addressed if they are to persist. So they use a simulation to explore precarious    
55:47    
self-reinforcing sensory motor habits as a building block for a robot's behavior.    
55:53    
Our simulations of simple robots controlled by an iterative deform deformable sensor sensory motor medium    
56:00    
or IDSM demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of different habits, the    
56:06    
reenactment and the organization of an ecology of habits within each agent. The    
56:12    
form of the emergent habits is constrained with the sensory modality of the robot such that habits formed under    
56:19    
one modality say vision are more similar to each other than they are habits from under another let's say audition    
56:28    
and so we discuss these results in the wider context of three things or four    
56:34    
things. The first are inactive approaches to life and mind. The second    
56:40    
is sensory motor contingency theory. Third is adaptationist versus    
56:45    
structuralist explanations in biology. And then d the limits of functionalist    
56:50    
problem solving approaches to artificial intelligence.    
56:56    
So what we do now is functionalist and what they're suggesting is that there's    
57:01    
maybe the structuralist explanation. You know there is this in biology of    
57:07    
course we use an adaptationist explanation. So functionalist for modern    
57:13    
AI systems adaptationist for modern biological systems. And then they're talking about maybe more of a structural    
57:20    
explanation. So that's kind of where they're going with this paper.    
57:27    
Actually they have a nice part in here on alternative conceptions of the mind and    
57:35    
this was uh sort of goes back to cybernetics. So they they site Grey Walter and Ashb    
57:43    
and so these are of course early cyberneticists who are doing things with robots and with models. Um and so they    
57:51    
say alternative conceptions of the mind were available at the origins of artificial intelligence and robotics but    
57:57    
the rapid success of computer science left them aside. Over time the limitations of the problem solving    
58:04    
centered computational theory of the mind became apparent and the biologically inspired embodied and later    
58:11    
inactive conceptions of the mind gain momentum. We are now immersed in a mesh of hybrid architectures applied to a    
58:18    
wide range of practices from industrial to scientific modeling applications and    
58:24    
a new summer of artificial intelligence is rising with robots as a major container of social and technological    
58:30    
expectations. So they kind of cite the early cyberneticis    
58:35    
and sort of say that there was this alternate path that was never taken, but I'm not sure that they actually explore    
58:43    
back down that path. Nevertheless, I think this is looks like a really good paper in terms of framing maybe some of    
58:51    
the assumptions that we're making um in our models. Then we have other papers.    
58:56    
There's this one is reach space analysis of baseline differential extrinsic    
59:01    
plasticity control or D control and this is uh where you're looking at    
59:09    
sensory motor goal or I guess in this case goal-f free simulated agents that    
59:14    
produce environmentally aware behaviors. So they further extend this mechanism to    
59:20    
intentional behavior to determine whether shortcircuited DP or differential exttrinsic plasticity can    
59:28    
generate desired trajectories in a robotic arm by a simple open loop control with transient limit cycle    
59:35    
dynamics exploring experiments involving target reaching in circular motions. So    
59:40    
this almost sounds like an alternative to control theory for robots where in    
59:46    
control theory you're often using feedback and you're using this sort of    
59:51    
goal oriented uh feedback mechanism uh and control plant mechanism to guide u    
1:00:00    
sensoring behavior. In this case, they are these go-f free simulated agents    
1:00:05    
producing environmental way behaviors, meaning responding to environment and then building these open loop systems    
1:00:12    
that could perhaps generate similar trajectories.    
1:00:19    
This next one is resonance is a design strategy for AI and social robots.    
1:00:25    
thinking about physical mechanisms of resonance and adaptive resonance with    
1:00:30    
human experience consider with consideration for enhancing those experiences with human    
1:00:37    
robot interactions. This one here with self- concern across    
1:00:43    
scales a biologically inspired direction for embodied artificial intelligence.    
1:00:49    
Sims focuses on a foundation for intelligence for all biological systems that reflects an existential tasks of    
1:00:56    
continued viability. So this is like that other paper we saw where they talked about    
1:01:02    
this was the egg in Renandian paper where they talked about precarious    
1:01:08    
self-maintaining or organizational living systems. In this paper by Sims,    
1:01:14    
this is uh sort of this continued viability.    
1:01:20    
Self- concern is introduced as a property of a complex system that describes its tendency to bring about    
1:01:25    
states that are compatible with its continued self-maintenance, a potential means of recapitulating the    
1:01:33    
power and principles of humanlike intelligence and artificial systems.    
1:01:40    
So there couple more papers here I'm not going to go over necessarily. I think    
1:01:46    
this is another paper by Eggbert Garner and Eggbert. Uh embodied embodiment enables    
1:01:53    
non-predictive ways of coping with self-caused sensory stimuli. This demonstrates how sensory attenuation for    
1:02:00    
self relative to externally caused stimula can be explained inactively.    
1:02:07    
Yeah. So there are a couple more papers I'm not going to go through, but I think you get the sense that there's a very    
1:02:13    
heavy emphasis on embodiment and and activism and kind of framing a lot of traditional    
1:02:21    
questions in cognitive science in that way. Looking at how those that those    
1:02:26    
concepts fit into things like the free energy principle and sort of cognitive sciences.    
1:02:34    
uh you know there's this sort of focus in cognitive science on problem solving and function. So usually if you're    
1:02:42    
describing something like attention there's this functional description of attention. Attention does something. It    
1:02:51    
processes information. It gives you this output. It's an input output scheme. And    
1:02:56    
so that doesn't necessarily consider, you know, other things that are going on    
1:03:01    
with attention, maybe its origins or other things that might be of equal    
1:03:07    
usefulness in applying this to say robotics or artificial intelligence or    
1:03:13    
something like that. And I mean I don't know how closely this    
1:03:18    
hues to some of the uh like anthrobot stuff and the biobot stuff but there was    
1:03:23    
a lot of I think movement that the whole point of this though is to move in that direction to have like a sort of a    
1:03:31    
theory for this going forward. Yeah, I you know course what makes    
1:03:41    
So one just want to say it's totally wrong but Tim verbal    
1:03:46    
I think I was thinking of Tim okay anyway like Tim Verblin I know because    
1:03:55    
so he's he's like some leads at ver at    
1:04:02    
Okay. And so I think I just know him from a bunch of first papers    
1:04:10    
as opposed to the diffusion imaging experts at CM.    
1:04:15    
Yeah. Um but uh yeah,    
1:04:21    
it's you know there's still that this very    
1:04:28    
like Yeah, the problem of of scaling this    
1:04:35    
toots is of course they have systems, right?    
1:04:42    
You know, I mean, I guess it just kind of pushes Michael's point about like    
1:04:52    
that there are many diverse intelligence, right?    
1:04:57    
Yeah. And cognition all the way down. is yeah yeah yeah um    
1:05:03    
but it is it is so that that's certainly what makes it    
1:05:09    
interesting is that like you have to you have to understand this as being some    
1:05:16    
possible from some collection of cells that don't even have a ner you know    
1:05:23    
don't even share a nervous system let understand how a single cell behavior is    
1:05:29    
is guided And yeah, so great great talk from    
1:05:40    
I don't know what the lever is it lever institute in Cambridge    
1:05:46    
sounds something like that like physics of life or I forget what their    
1:05:52    
mission is but yeah great great talk on kind of like    
1:05:58    
chemotaxis behavior seems to involve    
1:06:11    
some of those things just have trouble, you know, some of these concepts I have trouble putting into a cellular box,    
1:06:18    
right? But I but I you know I think that is more my problems    
1:06:28    
are just like like habits and language right make it such    
1:06:37    
but I I I also noticed very    
1:06:44    
small group of people publishing. Yeah. Yeah. So like like some of those    
1:06:49    
authors I could see that the reviewers were like same same authors from the    
1:06:56    
first paper you know it is it is just the reviewer of the one    
1:07:03    
and yeah I'm not suggesting something bad but    
1:07:08    
just you know it's just kind of like it's a very small Yeah. Yeah.    
1:07:16    
Well anyways. Yeah, I thought that Oh, go ahead. Yeah, it and the final thing that like    
1:07:21    
like when we were kind of thinking about thousand frames like you go to the    
1:07:27    
discussion section of that paper. Yeah. And it's like the first reference is the thousand brains.    
1:07:34    
It's like it's totally Hawkins 2017.    
1:07:39    
Yeah, there's a lot of self-reference in a lot of this stuff. I mean, some of it is that it's like people are starting to    
1:07:45    
think about it, so you don't have a lot of deep background in, but also like,    
1:07:51    
you know, there's like who's going to review the paper? Um, and that's a problem with review.    
1:07:59    
Absolutely. I mean, you know, like, you know, there's like two MRI guys that    
1:08:07    
are both resigned to the fact that every time they publish a paper, the other one gets asked Yeah,    
1:08:12    
because they're like, "Nobody understands this stuff except these two." So, so at least there's two of    
1:08:20    
them. Yeah. So, you can at least call it.    
1:08:27    
Yeah. Yeah. But Yeah.    
1:08:35    
But, you know, it's it's    
1:08:42    
Okay. Yeah, I thought that was interesting. Um,    
1:08:49    
it it's it's also, you know, just thinking a bit about the,    
1:08:55    
you know, me throwing stones at all the the organoid people and five people that    
1:09:02    
got companies filed pats and it's just like like how many students of Fen or or    
1:09:10    
people associated with Fen are like working at robotics companies, right now    
1:09:15    
like pushing pushing active inferences    
1:09:32    
because it's not just verses. Yeah.    
1:09:39    
Okay. So I uh I I had I did talk about    
1:09:44    
at our last meeting I did talk about Valentino Bradenberg and how he was a neuroanatomist    
1:09:51    
and that how that may have influenced it or he did influence his work on vehicles    
1:09:57    
and some of the thing some of the cross topics there    
1:10:02    
wanted to follow up with some additional stuff on that. uh mainly this idea that    
1:10:08    
uh Valentino Benberg is what he called himself as a biocyiberneticist.    
1:10:14    
So we talked about the cyberneticists like Ray Walter who did a lot of things with robotics or Ashby who did some    
1:10:21    
things with um intelligence and then you know we had people who    
1:10:27    
maybe weren't as connected to that original Macy conference as    
1:10:33    
you know we would like but they're still sort of in that cybernetics game. So    
1:10:38    
Bradenberg was kind of considered a biocyiberneticist which is applying the principles of cybernetics to uh    
1:10:45    
biological systems in this case also simulated systems. So I have some    
1:10:50    
readings here um that you know these are kind of deep cuts uh so they're some of    
1:10:56    
them are old well they're all old because if they're written by Valentino Bradenberg they'd be you know written    
1:11:03    
maybe in the 20th century. uh but we'll see what and then I have something to show in terms of how we think about    
1:11:11    
uh some of these concepts with developmental work vehicles and how his    
1:11:17    
ideas square away with that. So the first paper is this um advanced    
1:11:25    
physiological sciences article and I'm not quite sure what year this was    
1:11:30    
because they don't put it in the citation but uh this is volume 16    
1:11:36    
sensory functions. This is anatomical basis for divergence    
1:11:41    
convergence and integration in the cerebral cortex. So as I mentioned    
1:11:46    
before he was u a biocyberneticist there's a biocyibernetics    
1:11:54    
uh wing of the max plunk institute so they have this u they still actually    
1:12:00    
have biocybernetics as an area of specialty and I guess in this case what they're doing is looking    
1:12:06    
at uh mainly biological systems like the brain in this sort of cybernetics way    
1:12:13    
and I don't know what cybernetics means But this is what kind of what Valentina    
1:12:18    
Bradenberg was thinking about. So what his concern was here was looking at the    
1:12:23    
anatomical um aspects of cerebral cortex    
1:12:29    
and then looking at um you know some of these you know the electrphysiology of    
1:12:35    
it and the anatomy and how that comes together.    
1:12:41    
So he talks about cortical electrphysiologists and he says they're beginning to    
1:12:46    
generate functional models which must be eventually be fitted into the known structures of the cortex. So this was    
1:12:53    
many years ago now. So this is I'm not sure if this is still true but um I    
1:12:59    
guess we know if I have functional models now but like you know again we have to fit this into the known    
1:13:05    
structure of the cortex and you know that can always be challenging    
1:13:11    
quite independently from this ancillary rule of histologology. The structure of the cerebral cortex is impressive enough    
1:13:17    
to invite speculation on its own. particularly the view of the cortical computer derived from the    
1:13:24    
electrophysiology of sensory motor areas is quite different from that uh from    
1:13:30    
that which the global view of the cortical anatomy inspires. So there's this idea of the cortical    
1:13:36    
computer and how this is based on the electrophysiology of certain areas of    
1:13:43    
cortex and then there's this global view of cortical anatomy.    
1:13:48    
These two views will eventually converge. As a counterweight to the prevailing trend, I shall collect here    
1:13:54    
some obvious facts from cortical anatomy which are frequently overlooked although    
1:13:59    
they might significantly contribute to our ideas of the working of the cortex as a whole. So he was struggling with    
1:14:06    
this idea that there's this you know there are these areas of cortex which we    
1:14:11    
study quite intensely. we have computational models of those and then we have cortex in general and what that    
1:14:20    
is. So this is again kind of thinking about the neural anatomy but also    
1:14:26    
thinking about the function and then um you know kind of putting that together.    
1:14:34    
So he kind of goes through the macroscopic macroscopic anatomy he goes    
1:14:40    
through the description of the synapses. This is all descriptive. So, this is not necessarily    
1:14:46    
um I mean it just tells you what's there. Um    
1:14:52    
and then talking about some of the classification of synapses.    
1:14:57    
Um and then the density of neurons, the types of neurons,    
1:15:03    
relative number of the three types, exonal density. So, it's like this kind of laundry list of what he's seeing in    
1:15:09    
this model. This is um so yeah this is the albino housemouse.    
1:15:17    
So this is uh being compared to human cortex but focusing on the albino    
1:15:23    
housemos. So you go through all of this uh description    
1:15:30    
divergence and convergence. So this is uh interesting that this is a    
1:15:36    
learning machine. It is important that it be free to learn whatever patterns are presented. There must be the    
1:15:42    
possibility of a connection from every neuron to as many as possible many as possible other neurons. If a paramidital    
1:15:49    
cell has 5,000 synaptic contacts with how many different cells is it connected? So this is where you know we    
1:15:57    
have uh one cell being connected to every other cell having this fully connected    
1:16:03    
architecture. And so this is so there are two lines of arguments to suggest the answer is with    
1:16:11    
almost as many and this is cited in Braenberg 1978.    
1:16:16    
Um first we consider that the cross-section of the dendritic tree of the neuron and    
1:16:22    
derive a geometric measure of probability of a fiber entering its confines and hitting it once twice etc.    
1:16:30    
The probability is very small for two or more hits. So I think this is a picture of this where you have this dendritic    
1:16:38    
tree and you look at the architecture of the tree and see how many times it sort of intersects    
1:16:44    
and you're getting a measure of the sort of full connectivity of the uh cortex.    
1:16:53    
So this is a cross-section of the basil denditic tree of a pyramidal cell as seen by a straight fiber entering its    
1:16:59    
confines. So this shows this And then there's this probabilistic estimation that's made uh    
1:17:08    
you know what are the uh surface area of this region and the area of the c circumscribed circle the probability    
1:17:15    
probability of hitting it twice is proportional to the small hatched area here. So this these cross twice and you    
1:17:24    
see this here. Um second we may picture a neuron as a    
1:17:29    
cloud of postsaptic sites intermingled with thous many thousands of clouds of    
1:17:34    
postsaptic sites of other neurons. If a fiber entering that region picks its contacts at random, we may calculate the    
1:17:42    
probability of it hitting that neuron once or many more times by the binomial    
1:17:47    
distribution. Here again it turns out the probability of multiple hits is quite small. So he's working out this    
1:17:54    
problem by doing sort of a topological model and figuring out how if you just    
1:17:59    
generate connections, how often do they cross each other and you can calculate that    
1:18:06    
probability and then doing a sort of a probability density function approach    
1:18:11    
where you just assume like u you know just a cloud of interactions.    
1:18:17    
And in both cases it turns out that this is a quite a small probability of    
1:18:23    
happening. So what what does this mean? This means    
1:18:28    
ultimately we derive the picture of the cortex as a device which reshuffles the incoming information in as many as    
1:18:36    
possible ways perhaps in order to discover correlated activity and to incorporate this knowledge in the form    
1:18:42    
of what he calls cell assemblies which of course are a thing that um he    
1:18:47    
proposes in 1978. cell assemblies in the cerebral cortex    
1:18:53    
and then you know we have more modern work that kind of expounds it.    
1:19:00    
So that's the first paper. The second paper is this brain size and    
1:19:05    
number of neurons and exercise and synthetic neuro anatomy. This is a more recent. This is from 2001.    
1:19:13    
And um so he he kind of gives this these different models of um sort of    
1:19:22    
invariances in comparative neuro anatomy. Uh so let's go through the    
1:19:27    
abstract. Certain remarkable invariances have long been known in comparative neural    
1:19:33    
anatomy, such as the proportionality between normal density and the inverse    
1:19:38    
of the cubic root of brain volume or that between the square root of brain weight and the cubic root of body    
1:19:44    
weight. Very likely these quantitative relations reflect some general principles of the architecture of neural    
1:19:52    
networks. So we have these quantitative aspects. So we have brain volume, brain weight,    
1:20:00    
body weight. So this is the sort of elementary scaling that you'll see in biological systems. Uh brain growth is    
1:20:08    
you know a brain can grow but it's usually with respect to the body. So you get bigger brains and bigger animals,    
1:20:15    
smaller brains and smaller animals. And then that scaling can change itself. that scaling function    
1:20:22    
can change its slope based on the expansion of vertical regions or sometimes in birds it's um    
1:20:31    
the the toe and suffer and so you get this sort    
1:20:38    
of uh scaled relationship and it gives us these quantitative    
1:20:43    
measures that we can get a sense of the architecture of    
1:20:49    
you also see this in in the uh in the hippocampus of different    
1:20:55    
organisms especially if they engage in a lot of foraging versus not    
1:21:01    
under the assumption that most of the brain volume is due to fibers. We propose four abstract models. So the    
1:21:07    
first is constant fiber length per neuron. Two is fiber lengths that are    
1:21:12    
proportional to brain diameter. Three is a complete set of connections between all neurons.    
1:21:20    
and four is complete set of connections between compartments each containing the square root of the total number of    
1:21:26    
neurons. So these are four abstract models. These are just assuming different things about    
1:21:31    
the brain volume and what's inside there. So we kind of think that most of    
1:21:37    
the brain volume is due to fibers and connections packed in there. We also you    
1:21:43    
know can assume maybe a constant fiber length. So if we assume a constant fiber length and we assume that most of the    
1:21:49    
volume is fibers, we can then calculate the number of neurons.    
1:21:55    
We can also assume the fiber length is proportionate to human brain diameter.    
1:22:00    
We can assume a complete set of connections between all neurons which gives us maybe a number for the number    
1:22:06    
of connections and then the number of neurons. And then four is a complete set of    
1:22:11    
connections between compartments each containing the square root of the total number of neurons. So this is where we    
1:22:17    
have modularity. We have these modules that are connected selective with very    
1:22:23    
few connections and then each module is fully connected with it.    
1:22:29    
Um and then so talks about the models in terms of what they correspond to. Model    
1:22:35    
one conforms well the cerebellar cortex. Model two yields the observed    
1:22:40    
comparative invariances between the number of neurons and brain size.    
1:22:46    
And this is of course a salometric scaling idea. Model 3 is totally    
1:22:51    
unrealistic. So that is our um complete set of connections between    
1:22:58    
all neurons. So that's actually totally unrealistic. And then model four is compatible with    
1:23:03    
the volume of the hemisphere white substance and therefore alian species.    
1:23:08    
So what this paper is suggesting um kind of is maybe in contrast to the other    
1:23:15    
paper but also maybe supporting the other paper is that we can think about    
1:23:21    
the brain or the volume of cortex in terms of how it's connected. we can work    
1:23:27    
backwards, find the uh number of neurons, find the connectivity patterns and then you know uh make certain    
1:23:35    
assumptions about those connectivity patterns and see how well that model fits the data.    
1:23:40    
So no, we don't have fully connected neur neural networks. we actually have    
1:23:46    
maybe this modular network where there's maybe local full connectivity and then    
1:23:53    
selective global connectivity and that would fit what we see in mamalian species.    
1:24:01    
So he goes through um you know a lot about    
1:24:07    
this sort of the set of assumptions how these are set up. We have these four models    
1:24:14    
and talking about real brains. Uh unashamedly unrealistic as our    
1:24:21    
schemes of one to four may seem. They do yield some values that are remarkably close to measurements of real brains.    
1:24:29    
And so we're going to boost through some of these comparisons.    
1:24:35    
Um and so yeah, we know from experiments    
1:24:41    
that elementary scaling is a 2/3 power law. The number of neurons in the 2/3    
1:24:48    
power of brain weight is something that was established experimentally back in    
1:24:53    
the 1950s and 1960s. So this is where we have the alometric    
1:24:59    
scaling for the number of neurons versus brain weight in grams. So the weight of the the meat or the weight of the sort    
1:25:06    
of the tissue versus the number of neurons within that volume of tissue. So    
1:25:12    
you can see that you know monkey, cat, rat and mouse all fall along this slope.    
1:25:17    
And then humans are out here as an outlier. And the reason humans are out as an outlier is because in in our uh in    
1:25:26    
a lot of primates you have this expansion in great apes you have this expansion of the brain and in humans you    
1:25:33    
have the greatest expansion of brain tissue and so you have this outlier.    
1:25:42    
Okay. So then you know this just talks about like thinking about this approach of uh what he calls    
1:25:51    
synthetic neuroanatomy where we're using simulations we're using mathematical models to model a lot    
1:25:58    
all of this stuff and so I think it's a useful approach    
1:26:03    
um it's definitely something that we've picked up on in our group and this is a    
1:26:09    
slide I made up of these four models of the brain So in black is from this paper    
1:26:14    
we just talked about and then in red is sort of the way that this is dealt with    
1:26:19    
in the developmental neuro simulation paradigm. And if you're interested in more about this, we have a series of    
1:26:25    
papers um on our website that have been published in various places that go over    
1:26:31    
some of these concepts. And so um neur developmental neuro simulation kind of    
1:26:38    
addresses all four of these models in different ways. And so if you think about like a vehicle because he's    
1:26:44    
talking about real neural anatomy but eventually he gets to this sort of model of vehicles    
1:26:51    
and you know thinking about the vehicle versus the actual brain. Um you know    
1:26:58    
we'll talk about vehicles here but he's talking about sort of real brains. What    
1:27:03    
we're interested in is using vehicles as a means to get to simulated brains or developmentally relevant brains.    
1:27:11    
Um so then the first uh model that is brains of uniform density    
1:27:16    
and this is where we have a comp a compartment which contains a brain. The    
1:27:22    
density is uniform across that. The volume is sort of uh there's a volume    
1:27:28    
and a density of content. So there's this little container here this gray region that has a certain density of and    
1:27:35    
within that density we have neurons and axons dendrites. we have the connections and the neurons.    
1:27:42    
And in developmental neuros simulation, this is uh a size of a network that's    
1:27:48    
growing. So in in developmental neuro simulation, our network is constantly    
1:27:53    
growing within a volume or the volume is expanding and this expands the size of    
1:27:59    
our network. And so we kind of approach this in a little bit different way. Remember from    
1:28:05    
our last discussion, Braenberg kind of downplayed the significance of    
1:28:11    
development or at least he didn't talk about development in his work. In our case, we're explicitly interested in    
1:28:16    
development. So, we're interested in the size of this neural network in this    
1:28:21    
network of connections. And for a uniform density, we probably have a fully connected network. And so, we    
1:28:28    
characterize our uh matrix of network connections as a determinant    
1:28:35    
which is here A. And so what is the size of a? And so in developmental neural    
1:28:41    
simulation, you have this determinant that gets recalculated over time as the network grows. And so this grows in    
1:28:49    
size. And this can be also stated in terms of density. I'll have not done    
1:28:54    
this here where you have a restricted space in which you can put more and more    
1:29:00    
neurons. So the size I should also probably put the density of a as well but I'll do    
1:29:06    
that later. Um the second part is this network here in    
1:29:12    
this vehicle from sensor to a factor which we can characterize as wij.    
1:29:19    
This is where the length of each of these connections is proportional to the diameter of the brain.    
1:29:26    
So as uh WIJ grows as the body grows this is in in Brainenberg's work this is    
1:29:33    
brain body scaling in developmental neuros simulation this is also brain body scaling but in this case we don't    
1:29:39    
have just a compartment of a brain we have this mapping from sensor to a factor which as this distance between    
1:29:46    
the sensor and a factors grow or the relationship between them changes we get    
1:29:51    
a a different length of our connection. So our connections are you know we have things that are connected. So we have    
1:29:59    
sensors connected to inner neurons connected to aectors. We can describe that with wij    
1:30:05    
but we also get more connections. We also get uh a longer distance between    
1:30:12    
the sensor the inner neuron the inner neuron factor and so forth. We can characterize Wij    
1:30:18    
both in terms of growth in terms of number of units but also in terms of the    
1:30:25    
length of these connections. And of course biologically speaking the length of the connection is important because    
1:30:31    
the longer the connection the more conduction delay you get and the more    
1:30:36    
leakage you can get unless you have myelinated axons. So these are you know    
1:30:42    
things to consider. um you know I don't know if we consider this in a synthetic model but definitely    
1:30:48    
in biology then models three and four are the first number three is a complete set of    
1:30:54    
connections between neurons which is just basically this mass of connections    
1:31:00    
without any modularity and then four is where you have this fully connected end    
1:31:06    
to the half compartments these are modules with limited connections but internally with complete    
1:31:12    
connectivity and So we can bridge those two models actually in the developmental    
1:31:18    
neural simulation paradigm by saying that a selective set of connections between neurons involves n to the half    
1:31:26    
compartments. And so we can actually have these kind of compartments play the    
1:31:31    
role of inter neurons or other modules in a in an agent brain.    
1:31:38    
whether those are functional or not is you know we can we haven't really gotten to the point where we would test those    
1:31:44    
kinds of hypotheses. In any case um so let's go on the next    
1:31:49    
paper here and this is from 1974. So he was doing his work in the you know from the 50s to    
1:31:58    
2001. So this is like a long period of time that was working. Uh but this is uh    
1:32:03    
from 1974 and again he was doing a lot of neuro anatomy. So some of this is just really cut and dry neural anatomy.    
1:32:10    
It doesn't think about too much about the simulation aspects or the modeling aspects. But in the last paper as we saw    
1:32:18    
there is this very strong simulation aspect biocyibernetic aspect.    
1:32:25    
So um summary of this paper he's working in um so he's working in the visual so    
1:32:32    
in the first visual ganglene of the fly musa domestica there are many similar    
1:32:37    
visual channels or cartridges connected to each other by various systems of fibers most regular of which consist of    
1:32:45    
the collateral branches of the L4 neuron which is contained in each cartridge.    
1:32:50    
The three collaterals of L4 run to three different cartridges. One of which is the parent cartridge of the neuron. The    
1:32:56    
other two being neighbors of that cartridge in two directions and a hexagonal array. Within each cartridge,    
1:33:03    
there are thus the endings of three collaterals in three different L4 neurons. These make close physical    
1:33:09    
contact and serial sectioning shows that each collateral is presinaptic to the other two. It follows that there are    
1:33:16    
reciprocal synapses between any pair of these collaterals. And then the network relationships thus    
1:33:23    
set up is a simple scheme of coupling in a hexagonal. So he shows images of this.    
1:33:29    
So he works in this area uh where he's thinking about um flies and their visual    
1:33:36    
ganglen. So in diparians the visual field is resolved in discrete points    
1:33:42    
each corresponding to the central axis of one omatidia. So the fly visual    
1:33:47    
system is different from the mamalian visual system that they have these small omatidia that form discrete points or    
1:33:55    
dots in a visual array. So you know we have sort of this    
1:34:01    
call a camera like eye which has like spatial resolution more continuous    
1:34:06    
spatial resolution. we have um you know we can detect shapes and blobs and    
1:34:12    
things like that. In the fly visual system we have these dots and they're p    
1:34:20    
you can present things in terms of dots and they find patterns between dots. Um    
1:34:26    
and so this divides things up into these subunits and there are thousands of subunits in the eye. they function much    
1:34:34    
differently than our um than our retina. So this is you know kind of the basis    
1:34:41    
for a different type of visual system and then looking at how that's organized.    
1:34:46    
So this is the arrangement of L4 or collaterals between the L4 main fiber    
1:34:52    
which is the black dot and the cartridges the white circle. So you have this sort of organization.    
1:34:58    
Uh it's a different type of organization than the mamalian visual system. And I think this is important because a lot of    
1:35:05    
what we do in in pattern recognition in our studies of visual perception say    
1:35:10    
using neural network is to assume this sort of model that is presumptive of    
1:35:17    
mamalian cortex. And this is not mamalian cortex. This is a very    
1:35:22    
different way of organizing a visual system. And so this is just showing how    
1:35:27    
these, you know, how these systems are organized, how they're wired up, and then how they function. So this is an    
1:35:35    
electro microraph of a syninnapse. So this is an electron microraph where you    
1:35:40    
see the different structures. They're pretty well resolved. Um,    
1:35:46    
and he shows he's labeled L3, L4, R six.    
1:35:51    
And the receptor cell axon is R six. The neurons are L3 and L4. And you can see    
1:35:59    
the connections here. L1 and L2.    
1:36:05    
So he gets through the neuro anatomy. He talks about the connectivity. He has this diagram of reciprocal    
1:36:11    
contacts between L3 L4 endt. And so this just shows what the cartridges look    
1:36:18    
like. So remember this is all neuro anatomy and one of the basis one of the    
1:36:24    
bases for great vehicles was to say okay there's this very highly specific    
1:36:29    
anatomical relationship between sensor and if we look at an insect we can see    
1:36:35    
that there are these structures in the sensor. we have these structures in between the sensor and aector which is    
1:36:41    
kind of the brain wiring and then the aector which has its own structure and so what he's doing is working out all    
1:36:47    
this the idea is that if you work out the anatomy enough you can get this very precise model that can produce all sorts    
1:36:54    
of behaviors which is what he was interested in in the book vehicles and    
1:37:00    
so this just really kind of describes um this s sort of system our findings    
1:37:05    
indicate that reciprocal synapses as described in RAW at all 1966 in the    
1:37:11    
old factory bulb with the rabbit maybe a more widespread feature of nervous systems than has hitherto been supposed.    
1:37:19    
So his argument also is that some of these aspects um of neuroanatomy of    
1:37:25    
wiring are universal across different nervous systems. So we should lean into    
1:37:30    
those universal aspects. So yeah, he he talks quite a bit here    
1:37:36    
about uh symmetry and about some of these synaptic relationships    
1:37:42    
and how they might be, you know, really kind of if we can characterize them well    
1:37:47    
enough, we should be able to characterize the behavior they use.    
1:37:52    
He also has this other paper from 1974, thoughts on cerebral cortex, talking    
1:37:58    
about his thoughts on cortex. So um this is kind of where he thinks about it as    
1:38:04    
an input output system much in the spirit of cybernetics. So input output    
1:38:09    
means you have a sensory input you have some sort of output and then that gives    
1:38:15    
you behavior. Um so I'll just read the abstract here. Um so the cortex is often    
1:38:23    
described as a network processing information in the direction from sensory to motor area. signaling from    
1:38:30    
sensors to aectors. The motor aectors, the sensors that were bringing in stuff in the room that requires an input of    
1:38:37    
sensory information, output of motor uh behavior and something in between.    
1:38:45    
So this is kind of the assumption. However, the structure of the cortex is asymmetrical only in the vertical    
1:38:51    
direction suggesting an input output transformation between layers rather    
1:38:56    
than between areas. So if you think about the brain is uh you know having these modules or having these layers the    
1:39:04    
asymmetry is only in the vertical direction um this operation must be a very generally applicable one since the    
1:39:12    
plan of the cortex is basically the same everywhere. So in an attempt to understand it a    
1:39:19    
skeleton cortex of only paramidal neurons is considered. They are characterized by a doubled invertic    
1:39:25    
expansion. An apical one in which the first layer which is considered as the input layer    
1:39:31    
and a basil one which receives excitation from the axon collaterals of other paramidal cells.    
1:39:38    
So when he talks about layers, he's talking about the layers of cortex going from one down to six and kind of coming    
1:39:45    
back up. That's what he's kind of getting at with this. Um    
1:39:52    
if paramidital cells learn perhaps by growing dendritic spines to respond to frequent constellations of activity in    
1:39:58    
their apherence each will learn a property of the input through its apical dendrites provided it was preceded by    
1:40:05    
other properties sensed by neighboring paridital cells which influence it through basil dendrites. So in these    
1:40:12    
layers of cortex you have a lot of feedback but you also have this uh functional    
1:40:18    
uh specificity for each layer. Um thus the paramidital cells will code    
1:40:25    
its input in terms of properties which have a tendency to follow each other. This will be a a coding which reflects    
1:40:32    
the causal structure of the world. Various uses of a network embodying the conditional probabilities of events in    
1:40:38    
the input is described including the recognition of familiar sequences and prediction.    
1:40:44    
Local variation of fiber patterns in the cerebral cortex described as milo architectures is interpreted as a    
1:40:51    
macroscopical expression of the different statistics of the set of conditional probabilities linking events    
1:40:58    
represented by individual paramidal cells in different areas and in different functional.    
1:41:04    
So this is going through his thoughts about the sort of the vertical    
1:41:09    
asymmetries of cerebral cortex uh much more than between regions and    
1:41:16    
how that plays. So he's really kind of mapping out this sort of theory of cortex and this is not something that um    
1:41:24    
the nment people talk about. focus a lot on um Vernon Mount Castle's work on    
1:41:31    
discovering these kind of layers of cortex and the kind of relationships between one another. thinking about    
1:41:38    
things in these cortical columns, which is just a stack of these different layers of cortex arranged in units that    
1:41:44    
do things like process images or um process sound and and you know kind of    
1:41:50    
going through each layer doing different aspects of the processing.    
1:41:56    
And so you know he gives this conventional view of cortex as sort of these modules that are distinct sensory    
1:42:03    
areas. So you have connections between say sensory motor motor um you might    
1:42:10    
have visual and auditory and you know you you have to move between the regions    
1:42:16    
and so this is kind of this these regions of cortex and then you have the symmetry of the cortex which is this    
1:42:23    
layered cortex. So uh he says the anatomical picture does not bear out    
1:42:28    
this sort of model of distinct regions. Um if I am given a small cube exis    
1:42:36    
excised from a logical network showing the same asymmetrical pattern on four of its six sides and an isotropic    
1:42:43    
organization on the other two. I shall hardly suppose that the network processes information in the direction    
1:42:49    
indicated by the arrow a parallel to the layers of the asymmetrical organization of B. So as    
1:42:56    
you move across the surface of the cortex, that's a different thing than    
1:43:01    
moving up and down the cortex. But that's kind of the point making.    
1:43:08    
Okay? And so just thinking about the anatomy of the cortex gives us sort of,    
1:43:13    
you know, you have to reinterpret that in this differential view. So, you know, he's talking about this in 1974    
1:43:20    
and actually he's modeling the cortex using the skeleton cortex where he's    
1:43:25    
kind of thinking about it just stripping down everything in the cortex to these paramidital cells. And again, this is an    
1:43:32    
early version of computer simulation or you know thinking about this in terms of    
1:43:38    
computer simulation. And so this is a basic network of paramidal neurons or pine neurons    
1:43:45    
showing the apherent fibrous in the first layer apical denderites    
1:43:50    
basil denderrites and so forth. These are the apical dendrites. These are the    
1:43:56    
basil dendrites. So this is um    
1:44:02    
this is a pretty good paper. Um this actually reflects a little bit on what paramidital neurons represent. So each    
1:44:10    
paramidital neuron is connected in its own special way to a particular set of fibers the input layer through the    
1:44:16    
branches of its apical dendrit. We may say that each pine neuron represents a property of the input in the sense of    
1:44:23    
clean's 1956 representation of events and nerve nets namely in the sense that the pine neuron    
1:44:30    
becomes activated when an event has occurred in the input that is the property of which the pine neuron stands    
1:44:36    
for. We disregard for the moment the important question of how much synaptic influence under the peripheral portion    
1:44:43    
of the apocalyp ultimately arrive at the initial segment of the axon    
1:44:49    
but we can model this anyways. Um yeah so he builds this nice model and    
1:44:57    
uses pine neurons as memory elements as well. thinks about this in terms of the engram    
1:45:04    
and in terms of um different types of associative learning    
1:45:11    
and how that relates to modifiable synapses. So he's really thinking of this at the anatomical layer but he has    
1:45:17    
interests in you know traditional cognitive questions like memory    
1:45:23    
associative learning and so forth sensory motor learning. Um    
1:45:30    
So the assumption of this kind of memory in the pi neurons throws new light on the question of what they represent.    
1:45:36    
Having learned in the fashion described they represent properties of the input which have a tendency to occur in a    
1:45:41    
certain sequence. So he's thinking about sequential learning or sequential information or if emphasis is not as    
1:45:48    
much on the temporal order of events as on the fact that occurrence of one event raises the probability of the occurrence    
1:45:54    
of another such as an heavy. We might say that pinerans represent those    
1:45:59    
properties of the input in terms of which the causal structure of the world represented becomes evident. If a    
1:46:06    
connection axon lateral based dendrid has been established as a syninnapse because that has frequently contributed    
1:46:13    
to the state of excitation of the neuron. It follows that the synapse is a record of the conditional probability and gain    
1:46:20    
the activity of the presinaptic neuron with that of the post synaptic one.    
1:46:25    
So in terms of the outside world that synapse stands for a causal relation between the events represented by the    
1:46:31    
two neurons. So he's not just suggesting there's associative learning but that    
1:46:36    
there's this causal representation. So you know that's something that    
1:46:42    
um may be controversial even today to think about this in terms of a causal relation because there are a lot of    
1:46:48    
feedbacks as well and you know that's something that I don't know if he modeled that but that's something in the    
1:46:54    
brain that you often have and knowing like there's this whole area called credit assignment where you're trying to    
1:47:01    
figure out like what neuron is contributing or what set of neurons is contributing to what behavior.    
1:47:10    
This last paper are two views of the cerebral cortex. Um this is from brain    
1:47:16    
theory in 1986 and this kind of talks about um cerebral    
1:47:23    
cortex again and um he talks about reciprocal positive feedback. Um and so    
1:47:31    
he makes this comment here. Cortical anatomists and physiologists learn to shape their findings so as to    
1:47:37    
make them acceptable to the theoreticians. The resulting situation of reciprocal positive feedback has some    
1:47:44    
stable solutions. So uh there are a couple well let's see how many are there's five solutions here. The first    
1:47:51    
is random networks with and without learning. Lashley's philosophy is of this category as is headed's theory of    
1:47:58    
cell assemblies and um so head also this theory of cell assemblies Rosenblad's    
1:48:04    
perceptrons is also of this subject two the circuit diagram in this is in    
1:48:09    
the spirit of radio engineering the amplifier entered neurohysiology from communication engineering with it came    
1:48:16    
various ideas so this is kind of focusing on this uh aspect of    
1:48:23    
cybernetics as a circuit diagram. Read the digital computer and a logical    
1:48:28    
theory of nerve nets. This was soon recognized as a misleading analogy that the digital computer has at any rate    
1:48:35    
among all models of cortical function unique distinction of being a very useful machine and the theory formulated    
1:48:42    
by McCulla and Pitts made more palatable by clean lent the brain a flarable    
1:48:47    
mightiness for which uh which was gratefully recognized by    
1:48:53    
four the idea of projection derived from optics. So this is where you get these maps of the body surface or some sensory    
1:49:00    
space repeated many times in cortex or in some cortical structures. So again    
1:49:06    
projectionist research is still flourishing but uh we don't really understand    
1:49:12    
the details. Uh I think we're better off now than we were then. But still this is    
1:49:19    
um sort of derived from optics where you're projecting things in different ways uh through a lens. In this case the    
1:49:26    
lens is through the nervous system and processing of the uh sensory organs.    
1:49:34    
Number five, the idea of localization or function derived from dualist philosophy. If you are utterly convinced    
1:49:41    
that the connection between mind and brain escapes us as a matter of principle, all you can do is find out    
1:49:46    
what part of the brain is related to what faculty of the mind without asking any further questions about the nature    
1:49:52    
of the connection. This leads to very useful partitioning of the brain and perhaps less useful dissection of the    
1:49:57    
psyche on anatomical grounds. So he kind of goes through these points.    
1:50:04    
Um and then in view of these findings, it would seem difficult to sustain the    
1:50:09    
essential random network philosophy which has grown dear to our hearts on the basis of many anatomical facts.    
1:50:17    
However, I will show that it is possible to make the two points of view quite compatible with one another.    
1:50:23    
So he goes through this um talking about the neuropill in the mouse    
1:50:29    
cortex. Um so he says that all the essential features of cerebral cortex can be found    
1:50:35    
in the mouse except that in humans it's scaled up by a factor of 1,000 in terms    
1:50:40    
of size. It is a task requiring some experience to tell a hisytological section of a mus cortex from a human    
1:50:47    
one. Um before we approach the problem of the shape of neurons in the cortex, we take    
1:50:54    
a more global view and collect some quantitative data. So that's what he's doing here.    
1:50:59    
Making some measurements, the density of neurons, uh distinctions between synapse types,    
1:51:07    
uh axonal density,    
1:51:12    
uh and then the axonal trees of various neuron types.    
1:51:18    
uh dendrites uh the cross-section of a dendritic or    
1:51:25    
tree. So there are a lot of measurements you can use from the neuro anatomy.    
1:51:33    
In principle these figures provide the basis for a connectivity matrix of the cortical neurons. But of course the form    
1:51:39    
factors reflecting the shape of dendritic and axonal ramifications are also involved. The probability of a    
1:51:46    
connection between any two neurons in a block of tissue depends crucially on their distance. There are two ways of    
1:51:52    
calculating this for neighboring paramotic sites. One is based on the assumption that the connection by    
1:51:58    
straight axon collaterals that the form factor in the receiving side is described by the cross-section of the    
1:52:04    
dendritic tree. So you can describe the shape through these metrics that he's collecting from the neural anatomy and    
1:52:12    
then model these as appropriate.    
1:52:18    
So um what are the propositions which can be extracted from these anatomical    
1:52:24    
facts? Four of them are presented in table three. So we have the first one which is a and    
1:52:33    
they involve certain measures and that is most synapses are on spines.    
1:52:39    
The second which involves these other measures most contacts are paramidital to paramidital.    
1:52:45    
The third point is that the number of neurons apherent to a given IEL is    
1:52:50    
almost as great around 5,000 is the number of its apherent synapses.    
1:52:55    
Similarly for epherent synapses apherent are the ones heading towards a cell. Epherent are the ones coming from a    
1:53:02    
cell. And it's just a way in this case it's a neuron anatomical way to describe    
1:53:07    
feed forward and feedback. Then D which has another set of measures    
1:53:12    
still the cortex is a mixing machine. The activity is related in ever new    
1:53:18    
combinations from one set of neurons to the next. So you have this idea or this    
1:53:23    
idea that was prevalent I guess early on that cortex is this all to all connectivity machine. But then you know    
1:53:30    
we kind of thought well maybe not because there's you know distinct function and so you know there's this idea of    
1:53:37    
modularity there's all this also this idea of a mixing machine where there new    
1:53:42    
combinations generated all the time and so you know this this kind of I    
1:53:48    
guess is maybe the inspiration for connectionism but it gives us this sort of model of    
1:53:56    
you know connections versus function. The upshot is proposition D. Cortex is a    
1:54:03    
system of fairly uniform units, paramidital cells with smaller number of    
1:54:08    
neurons for different kinds of interspersed connected to each other by widespread but very weak links. So weak    
1:54:14    
in fact that the activity of one single cell can hardly exert an appreciable influence on the others. We must assume    
1:54:22    
that the elementary event is constituted by fairly large sets of active paramidital cells so that fresh sets    
1:54:28    
will be activated in succession due to synapse synapses performed in the cort    
1:54:34    
preformed in the cortical tissue and molded by a learning process. The picture I have in mind is influenced by    
1:54:40    
Heb's theory of cell assemblies by Abalis's sinfire chains by various    
1:54:45    
developments in this work by palm. So I guess um in this part of his career he was really kind of thinking very    
1:54:53    
theoretically in terms of like what is this what does the neuroanatomy I'm    
1:54:58    
looking at mean? Eventually of course he'd go on to write the vehicles book where he put all this together in these    
1:55:05    
toy models called vehicles and kind of like stating out some of these like    
1:55:10    
cleaning up some of these observations and stating them as the vehicle models.    
1:55:16    
So here's a wiring diagram here illustration of a naive neural model explaining some of the effects described    
1:55:22    
by Horn Weasel who did the uh cortical columns processing basic shapes um in in    
1:55:32    
visual cortex. So this so the um in a here the array of    
1:55:40    
dots represents the sampling points in a portion of the visual field. corresponding to the individual cones of    
1:55:46    
the retina. So you have this visual field, you have the cones, their dots. They're not like omatidia like we saw    
1:55:52    
with the insects, but they do have this sort of spatial array that they're located and they represent different    
1:55:59    
parts of the um visual field.    
1:56:04    
Uh okay. Um    
1:56:14    
so this kind of shows how they phase shift and then these two C and or see it    
1:56:20    
shows the connectivity between those different parts of the uh visual field    
1:56:26    
as you rotate them 18°. So these are things that belong to    
1:56:32    
different orientation columns. So one orientation column represents the visual    
1:56:38    
field like this and the other one represents it like this. They're shifted in orientation in in angle but they    
1:56:46    
represent the same spatial information.    
1:56:53    
Then he has some nice drawings of orientation specificity.    
1:56:58    
Uh this is an array of hyper columns seen from the top. So he's really into drawings and linking that with these    
1:57:05    
hisystologicals. Okay. So I think that's it for the    
1:57:11    
Braenberg stuff. I I went through and did a deep dive on that to get a sense of what was out there in uh his work and    
1:57:19    
his legacy and I think it's really interesting. So, I have the the one that we did last time, the last meeting, and    
1:57:24    
then this one. And I hope that's, you know, kind of inspiring for people to think about, you know, how to apply that    
1:57:31    
to agents and and other things like that.    
1:57:46    
Yeah. the range of his work.    
1:57:58    
Interest in collecting this mean not only finding common structures across    
1:58:04    
across different species    
1:58:10    
and types but relating those to conversational    
1:58:17    
structures paradigms. again    
1:58:24    
sort of what you see coming together,    
1:58:29    
right? Yeah. This is like about 10 years maybe    
1:58:36    
before vehicles leading up to it. So he's thinking like kind of you know he's    
1:58:41    
of course doing his neuroanatomy early in his career and then he's moving towards this theoretical thing this    
1:58:47    
theoretical interpretation then moving towards the vehicles which includes some of the things but some of you know    
1:58:54    
focusing on cortex which is interesting because the cortex is a major part of this this work but doesn't show up in    
1:59:02    
vehicles which begs the question like what is the relevance of cortex to    
1:59:07    
vehicles the portical bottles.    
1:59:17    
Yeah. So again, yeah, this is all um and then relating it back to the last thing I    
1:59:23    
talked about, which was of course there was a lot of free energy principle, but there was some work that was mmenta    
1:59:30    
flavored with cortical columns. And that's interesting too because you know    
1:59:35    
cortical columns are this organization. It's different from the sort of the connectionist view where you have this    
1:59:44    
uh you have layers but the layers are sort of you know they don't have a structure kind of like these random sets    
1:59:51    
of connections and they process things. So it's kind of like maybe an abstraction of the cortex of cortical    
1:59:58    
layers but it could also be like a sheet of neurons. It's not clear exactly what    
2:00:03    
that analogy is and it does things. It produces interesting things. But what's    
2:00:08    
the anatomical rooting for that with the cortical columns concept? It's very    
2:00:15    
explicit in terms of the anatomy rather than being vague or implicit. And so    
2:00:21    
that means that that opens up this sort of expectation that it can model uh like    
2:00:27    
sensory processing or multiensory processing better. And I don't know if that's true. um you know    
2:00:42    
so yeah that so I don't know if Jesse had anything to say or if    
2:00:48    
he's available. Hey, um I kind of came in a bit late, but I happened to see on    
2:00:56    
YouTube that you made like a deep dive or something like that. And I look    
2:01:02    
forward to going back to either seeing this recording or    
2:01:07    
to I think it's I've kind of um    
2:01:12    
I've been hoping for or anticipating or wanting to see something like this because I feel like it's such an interesting time and many things in the    
2:01:19    
life. So, excuse me.    
2:01:24    
Um, I look forward to going to it again. Uh, I don't know what was covered earlier today. Um, I might I might share    
2:01:33    
just a couple things maybe at the end. Yeah. I won't say a whole lot.    
2:01:38    
Um, anything that happened earlier that you think I should go back and look at    
2:01:45    
things? Um I mean Morgan gave a nice extended view of the stuff that he    
2:01:52    
talked about yesterday in the open source meeting um on bioprinting and    
2:01:58    
some of the stuff they're doing with cell culture. Then I went over a special issue of    
2:02:04    
was that bio neuroai and it was a special issue with Adam Saffron and um    
2:02:13    
and and colleagues uh there they were doing a bunch of things with respect to an activism free energy principle    
2:02:21    
topics in in the space of robots for robotics.    
2:02:26    
It will probably be good and I think it might be    
2:02:34    
Uh two things of note this week on those similar topics would be um mirror match    
2:02:42    
has started and I'm just I'm just a a project mentor so I'm not super    
2:02:48    
involved. Yeah. Um, but that is    
2:02:53    
apparently I don't um I don't even remember um which I signed    
2:03:02    
up for, but either way I'm in I'm in both. Um    
2:03:08    
I'm in I'm a mentor for the neuro AI and mention for the other one. Okay. So that's exciting. And as you know    
2:03:14    
Neuromax is always very intense and and    
2:03:19    
It's kind of nice to be involved, but also not too involved this    
2:03:25    
time because there's so much other stuff    
2:03:30    
going on. It's actually a as I mentioned in the previous Friday,    
2:03:37    
it's super deeper.    
2:03:43    
Uh there's a lot going on. What what I want to do what I want to be doing this weekend is yes finishing the u u    
2:03:56    
um finishing the    
2:04:07    
the the presentation that's you know that's one thing that I can certainly do    
2:04:12    
and want to Um but    
2:04:19    
um more so than that    
2:04:28    
uh this    
2:04:34    
disappointing um there's I was trying to show um something from Echol.    
2:04:45    
Uh because we had uh Yeah, here we go. All right.    
2:04:56    
Here it is. I'll just I'll very quickly mention this. Uh, I forget if we've talked about who    
2:05:04    
um person    
2:05:11    
um    
2:05:21    
um all right. Uh, have we mentioned um    
2:05:29    
Anna    
2:05:37    
Anna? See see Oh, yeah.    
2:05:43    
Embodiment. Yeah. Yeah. Embodiment. Okay.    
2:05:49    
Long awaited. This this happened this week. Um it was    
2:05:55    
it was Elon Baron Holtz who is very interesting um in the sense of he's    
2:06:02    
doing a lot in this space of LM are    
2:06:08    
I think the AI height version of saying oh yeah you kind of like a you know LM    
2:06:14    
are are how but to that's maybe a bit unfair and I    
2:06:19    
think but a lot Elon's doing a lot right now with    
2:06:25    
LLM and the structure of language and how languages process in general and relating that to clinical science and    
2:06:32    
all stuff and Anna is much more um biological    
2:06:39    
embodiment focus and it was interesting because the discussion um which I don't    
2:06:46    
think is online yet I stumbled around thinking it was on YouTube but I don't think it is yet. The discussion was very    
2:06:51    
interesting because Ann is um um a very interesting she enjoys being a    
2:06:58    
philosopher, enjoys exploring, was very knowledgeable about embodiment and kind    
2:07:03    
of the Velian lineage. the sort of things that we talked about and it's interesting to kind of tease apart where    
2:07:11    
the defenses of embodiment which I'm sympathetic to and what Elon's doing which I'm still trying to sort out    
2:07:18    
exactly how I feel about it because one of part of it reminds me of um you know    
2:07:24    
the brain the mind is a blank with that concept and okay now LM version of that    
2:07:30    
which is a paper that I supposed to but also Um there's there's um    
2:07:39    
in my if I had infinite time this weekend or or    
2:07:45    
various other things I would assemble I would pro I would I would finish that paper and then I would also assemble    
2:07:52    
this sort of um one of the most interesting things to me from eological discussions about mind stuff    
2:08:00    
is len like I'm I'm kind putting forward this term. I kind of want to make    
2:08:05    
something using this term. So I it's it's there. Uh but but basically one of the main concept of language is    
2:08:12    
coordination or coordinating coordinating    
2:08:17    
ideas, coordinating um relations to avoidances or in a in a in a py way um    
2:08:26    
language as um teologicalation.    
2:08:32    
So about tools and that's that's I have a draft of something I want to write about that not because I really believe    
2:08:38    
it as um the best way to approach this but as a way to try to I think that lens    
2:08:46    
would be really useful for differentiating what we were talking about in in many some recent    
2:08:51    
conversations there and for those who don't know equal is sort of um    
2:09:00    
it's sort of like an impromptu to some things are very planned out, some of them are are much less so. But this is    
2:09:07    
sort of a oh, we have opportunity to get Elon and Anna together. it kind of came    
2:09:14    
you know brief briefly and so I was able to join the discussion or sort of    
2:09:19    
impromptu but not quite and we join the discussion and talk about stuff and it was good but essentially um Elon's Elon    
2:09:29    
is sorting out this LLM language invocation    
2:09:35    
Anna is is a really interesting embodiment to talk to about a variety of    
2:09:41    
And Addie is sort of working from a higher level on Addie of Solopus,    
2:09:49    
chairman, founder, lead is working on    
2:09:55    
um essentially old factory language, but oldactory language as an example of    
2:10:02    
making languages or or giving languages of different sort of forms or environments or cortises or sensory    
2:10:08    
makeups. and just so it's a means to explore the space in general and that's a very curious thing that's happening    
2:10:15    
and and I I you know uh I'll leave it at that when    
2:10:22    
that's available at 3 I think and and stuff like that um    
2:10:28    
but that that happened this week and I think there was one or one or similar other event um in that nature    
2:10:38    
but you mentioned And oh yeah, and your MS stuff. And then um    
2:10:45    
the last the last sort of general thing I'll say is I want to check out the    
2:10:50    
Syron stuff. And this is this as I mentioned yesterday, this is a huge week    
2:10:56    
for um a lot of the nitty-gritty stuff like a a very    
2:11:02    
particular take of professional development. I'm doing the micro MBA. Um, I'm actively meeting with a lot of    
2:11:09    
folks in the how you build certain things since I'm excited about that for    
2:11:14    
what I want to do with JPro at large, but also some other personal projects. Um, and and trying to distill for people    
2:11:22    
going into the space, what do they need to know? I think the term was like organizational literacy. Um and and I    
2:11:31    
that's a that excuse me I think is sort of adjacent to    
2:11:37    
or or a box to me this sort of broader curriculum that fits the presentation    
2:11:42    
of like how do you present to different audiences that's sort of a very you're you're an agent or a node communicating    
2:11:48    
between some of these groups and then how do we do some of the structuring how do we do yeah sure funding and all that    
2:11:55    
other stuff but there's there's a lot of team strategy planning communication but I    
2:12:00    
think overlaps we think about and um    
2:12:05    
I'm going to try to continue the concrete comfortize to make concrete    
2:12:11    
some of these um things ahead over the summer so more on    
2:12:17    
that right that sounds great    
2:12:22    
yeah well thank you Jesse for that update and thank Morgan for your update and um why    
2:12:30    
don't we call it a day. Um thanks for attending. Yeah, I might reach out to you folks    
2:12:37    
both about some of the the discussion series things we've been talking about. U but that's about it. Otherwise,    
2:12:45    
thank you.

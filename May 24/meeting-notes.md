## Notes
NeuroAI ‚Äî> June 8-10 ‚Äî> Neurotech summit (Minneault, Escola).

Edge Esmeralda. 

Cybernetics program ‚Äî popularity to particular terms (rules). 

Network Theory ‚Äî Cybernetics ~ Complexity Theory.


Universality assumptions: mechanistic, computational model of brains.

cybernetics expanded out, fit into Rosenbluth typology.

metaphoric power, evolution of terms.


Simulations of Alignment ‚Äî Bengio-LeCun debate is recast from Wiener and Alan debates about electronic brains (1940s, 1950s).

Revisit Rosenbluth typology:

Acousto-Electric imaging. arXiv paper on Predictive Processing (Open EPhys).

Frequency-tag signal, stimulate tissue ‚Äî> collect data (solve inverse problem). Signal modulation, Pre-modeling other overhead. Demodulate high-frequency signal.

S:R issues, like cardiac imaging. Stephanie Jones ‚Äî Computational Neuroscience group (hnn.brown.edu). 256/512 electrode system (at reasonable prices). Spatially-specific neuromodulation. Kernel Flow 2: high-density fNIR system.


Meta-brains, BVs ‚Äî> Rosenbluth‚Äôs behavioral typology.

how does LLM behavior differ from ours? Tokenization, how active, purposeful.

mind, parts of experience. How do they work?


Whatever the mind is/isn‚Äôt, having abnormal affinity with something that seems understandable.

output that comes through sophisticated means.

* linking to innovations (mind is a cup, a vase).


Disembodied LLMs vs. embodied TVs. Fit into control outputs (behaviors) of cybernetics.

connect Representational Brains and Phenotypes with multi agent, AI, and RL approaches.

what is a physical body connected to? Pitfall of embodiment ‚Äî what is body connected to?

Ecologically-bound to generative context. Multi-inheritance model.

Anti-homogeneity (uniqueness). What is the ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù of embodiment? Cognitive Science as a planetary science.

entangle LLMs/linguistic acquisition with bodies, multisensory world.

kernel.com ‚Äî> devkit. Spatial maps and compositionality.

spatial maps and compositionality. Motor control system ‚Äî> foundation of compositional components.

Neural-Spatial ‚Äî> William James, pianists are ‚Äúcaching things in fingers‚Äù.

Meta papers on speech decoding (big push for compositionality).

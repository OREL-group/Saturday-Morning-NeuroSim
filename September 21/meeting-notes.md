## NOTES:
Jesse: progress on grants and other activity.

Trevor: Americorps. Invisible illness. Datasets and projects.

Shubham: University project --- working on a final-year project. Photonic imaging.

* device, measure energy levels through fingers.

Morgan: working on some consulting. 

* adolescent psychiatry, adverse child experrience ~ development of psychosis.

* Poverty in Bangladesh study. 

Overview of synthetic biology since 2000.

* survival can be framed as problem-solving -- what level of abstraction?

* Chris Fields -- Quantum computation @ cellular level.

* can we say computation as sub-cellular but not at the organismal level?

* life -- mastered time before mastering space.


Surprisal, predictive processing, and non-uniform Bayesian modeling.

* why is play enjoyable? Is it the soft materials, or the improvisation?


Multi-organism view of evolution -- what is it doing?

* history is adaptive., shows a type of learning. Generations.

* brainless organisms -- edit anatomy. No blueprint.

* Schizophrenia -- many genes making micro-decisions. Good enough "solutions".


Tissue talk -- Weiss institute. Ignorance on how to engineer biology.


ML Street Talk -- Mark Solms. Cortical/sub-cortical (brainstem regions).

* decorticated cats, can still do a lot of stuff (emotional responses).

* combine TMS with frug delivery, tumor-killing.

* build-a-cell -- synthetic cells and vescicles.

* understand things well on a mechanistic level.


Genetic ensembles: 100s of genes are involved in a high-dimensional spaces; multi-scale problem solving.


Two issues with SAINT:

1) fMRI requirement (TMS -- can it be so well-targeted?).

2) population-specific.

Neuronavigation systems:

* brain sits in a fluid --> Neurolink switch -- 80% of threads have pulled out in human trials.

* as the head moves, the brain moves.


Dipolar shift between lying in a magnet and sitting up.

* TFUS -- focused ultrasound. Better than TMS, TES. Can you hit a voxel-sized patch?


Romainian Orphans (important cohort to look at).

* how can we make a difference in mental health?

* frontal salience paper. Is it a novel depression marker? Better tailored interventions.


Check on these papers in 10 years. Long-term lessons.

* don't have circuit parsing tools in depression, schizophrenia.

* if schizophrenia was dopamine-driven, we would have cured it in the 1970s.


Goal-driven stuff, suprisal.

* goals, solutions, inputs, outputs.

* solving problem of x,y,z (way to frame problem, but not a natural kind).


Avoidance of the Usual Affordances

* play as reward (why is it fun?)

* how much role-playing is neccessary? Alien scientist model.

* vantage points -- not as beholden.

Jesse Parent says:
For later: there's something about the goal / problem framing that smacks a bit of "unreliable narrator", even if only from the perspective of that there's some anthropomorphism around framing or identifying a goal/problem/solution/output. 
Jesse Parent says:
"the avoidance of usual affordances" , yeah, is a key concept to me re the last 20 minutes of discussion 

## TRANSCRIPT
0:03     
hello hi all right uh good morning     
0:10     
morning so uh welcome to the meeting um this week we had a couple of meetings uh     
0:17     
we had our Deva Weare meeting which was good as usual we covered some papers in there uh we covered uh one of the gck     
0:26     
projects sort of the finale for that um and in on Wednesday we did the cognition     
0:34     
Futures meeting so we continued with the cybernetics paper that we've been uh     
0:40     
working on working our way through so last week we did the body of the text we     
0:46     
did that in two meetings and Jesse read it word for word so that was a a good     
0:54     
feat um we had some comments but we're looking for additional comments     
1:00     
um and then this week what we did was we went through some of the references and you know it's     
1:07     
always uh attempting to go through every reference and kind of read about it but     
1:12     
we did go through some of the more cybernetic oriented references and talk     
1:18     
about those a little bit so that's on on the Cog that's the cognition Futures meeting for this week where we talked     
1:25     
about that so we we talked a little bit about WR ashb we talked about the Ashby     
1:32     
box we talked about some of the other contributions to or sort of     
1:38     
intellectual precursors to machine learning from cybernetics which was actually     
1:45     
fascinating to kind of read a little bit about Ashby and just kind of be in that mindset thinking about like how he     
1:53     
described you know like statistical as statistical phenomena and you know systems phen     
2:01     
and this is well before we had a language and machine learning for so it's really interesting     
2:07     
stuff um hey I won't be able to say that     
2:13     
much till later but my general updates are just     
2:20     
um uh a lots a lots going on in general this week it's been a very um full week     
2:28     
and been a bit time constrained I've had to um manage a lot of things this week     
2:38     
but uh it's nice to go through the paper there     
2:44     
um there's a little bit of progress on     
2:49     
some uh grants and other activity there's also if I don't know if     
2:57     
I'll be around later for this but um uh I remember in the chat Sunday     
3:05     
Trevor mentioned something about um basically something with the maror     
3:13     
which I would follow up on if they're here later on just curious about that     
3:18     
um I've also been looking into a lot of things around invisible illnesses this     
3:24     
week um and I'm curious about     
3:31     
um I'm curious what can be done     
3:37     
from like our vantage point on certain things like there's certain like open open data sets and and products to help     
3:45     
out better volunteer with um but I'm I'm considering some other things too but     
3:52     
that's really all I can say for now um may be able to save it more later but     
3:58     
yeah well that sounds good thank you um yeah I saw that conversation in     
4:05     
the slack it's like tror was talking about like you had a project idea and he was     
4:11     
talking about some aspects of that looks like sham has joined us     
4:18     
welcome shup uh Hey Bradley Hi how are you actually     
4:24     
uh I'm I'm good um so actually I will I will be working on a project as part of     
4:31     
my uh uh University uh uh for my final year uh am I am I audible     
4:39     
yeah yeah so um uh in that project we will be uh using electrotonic Imaging to     
4:47     
uh detect brain functions um so that is the title for the project but I don't     
4:54     
really know what can be done uh what application can be made out of it so     
5:00     
because you have been working on neuroscience and everything so I thought I can ask um you for some     
5:08     
guidance yeah well I have to see what's you know what's uh what the project is     
5:14     
what the um you know what's going on there but yeah I'd be happy to give     
5:20     
feedback and Morgan I think might be able to do that as well yeah yeah um I'm I'm not exactly     
5:29     
familiar with electronic um if you've got a a reference or     
5:37     
something I I could I could probably say     
5:42     
more yeah but yeah I mean in general like just the research yeah yeah research questions or     
5:50     
what what people are trying to do with     
5:58     
it did you have any other update [Music] shoom I know I like owe you a couple     
6:05     
things I owe you a certificate and uh I agreed to write a letter of recommendation so that that'll     
6:13     
come pretty [Music] soon yeah okay uh I can share some     
6:21     
updates later uh until up until now uh we have done some work um what it does     
6:28     
is we have this device is where you can uh measure a person's energy levels from     
6:34     
their fingers and um utilize that data to find more about but I don't really     
6:42     
know what application can be made out of it so I'll share more details with you probably next week on Saturday again     
6:47     
okay that sounds good okay thank you so much yeah thank     
6:54     
you so there are a couple things in the uh slack that may be interesting so     
6:59     
we've been continuing to populate the computational Psychiatry Channel um this     
7:06     
is you know I don't know where we reviewed this last probably in July or     
7:11     
August so there's been a lot of activity in here it's like Trevor and Morgan have     
7:16     
done most of it but you know keeping up with it is always important so I think     
7:22     
you know there are a lot of different things in here that we could     
7:27     
review um I'll just kind of look through a couple of them and uh just just bring them to people's     
7:34     
attention here so you know there's all sorts of um AI types uh studies like     
7:41     
this one AI based differential diagnosis of dementia ideologies on multimodal     
7:48     
data this is a study in nature um uh I think Jess wanted to bump I     
7:57     
don't know if it was this paper but it was another paper to discuss later uh this is a nature     
8:03     
paper personalized brain circuit scores identifi clinically distinct biotypes     
8:09     
and depression and anxiety that's I think the one that Jesse bumped um he said it's wor Morgan said     
8:16     
it's worth it so that's oh is that the um um yeah let me let me move but is     
8:22     
that the Le Williams yeah yeah it is yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely     
8:28     
definitely worth it yeah yeah so this is where we have we need to     
8:33     
derive quantitative measures based on coherent neurobiological dysfunctions or     
8:39     
biotypes to enable stratification of patients with depression and     
8:44     
anxiety uh using task free and task aoke data a standard fmri protocol conducted     
8:51     
across multiple studies in patients with depression and anxiety when treatment     
8:57     
free and after randomization of pharmacal therapy or behavioral     
9:03     
therapy uh from these patients we derive personalized and interpretable scores of     
9:08     
brain circuit dysfunction rounded in a theoretical taxonomy     
9:15     
um there six biotypes that they extracted from the data they show     
9:20     
consistency with their theoretical taxonomy and were distinguished by symptoms behavioral performance on     
9:27     
General and emotional cognitive computerized tests in response to pharmacotherapy as well as behavioral     
9:34     
therapy our results provide a new Theory driven clinically validated and     
9:39     
interpretable quantitative method to parse the biological heterogeneity of     
9:45     
depression and anxiety thus they represent a promising approach to Advan Precision clinical     
9:51     
care and Psychiatry they have a study where they have treatment free people they have uh     
9:57     
randomized treatments and then they develop these scores brain     
10:02     
circuit dysfunction and develop these six     
10:07     
biotypes and so you have these profiles of different parts of the brain and how they     
10:14     
behave or how they are um activated I guess and so they're able to derve this     
10:21     
sort of theory driven approach to looking at brain dysfunction so this is uh uh kind of     
10:30     
showing what they did and these are the clustering of regional brain circuit     
10:35     
scores identifying six biotypes of depression and anxiety so this is the first Network     
10:42     
here this is the second Network the third network the fourth the fifth and the     
10:49     
sixth so they're all kind of networks that involve different areas of the brain so these intrinsic     
10:56     
circuits the default Network the attention Network and the salience and then the test drive     
11:02     
circuits are negative positive and cognitive uh so this is kind of where they're getting their color coding from     
11:10     
so you can see in the second example here these uh this is all     
11:16     
attentional uh this one here is attentional uh salience and default so a     
11:22     
is all three B is just the attentional C is uh the negative and     
11:30     
positive uh D is cognitive control uh and F is within Norms so     
11:38     
there's nothing uh you know doesn't involve anything so this is kind of an     
11:44     
interesting kind of way that they do this okay back to the     
11:52     
channel uh there's a paper onos uh cybin psilocybin desynchronizes the human     
12:00     
brain so you know we know that Amanda is interested in uh the effects of     
12:05     
hallucinogenics on cognition Morgan and her have been talking about that so     
12:11     
that's a I guess that's a slash article pointing to a New York Times     
12:17     
article uh let's see um you know a number of seminar     
12:24     
Series this paper schizophrenia genomics genetic complexity and function     
12:30     
insights this is uh where we have you know looking at the genomics of     
12:38     
schizophrenia the abstract reads determining the causes of schizophrenia has been a notoriously incable problem     
12:45     
resistant to a multitude of investigative approaches over centuries in recent decades genomic Studies have     
12:51     
delivered hundreds of robust findings that implicate now 300 common genetic     
12:56     
variants by genome white Association studies and more than 20 rare variants     
13:02     
by a whole XOM sequencing copy number variant studies so you have these uh you     
13:08     
know these different types of genomic studies Association studies uh whole XOM sequencing and then     
13:15     
looking at copy number variation um is risk factors for schizophrenia so they've actually     
13:22     
found uh you know a large number of genetic variants that are kind of     
13:27     
associated with schizophrenia but they want to look more deeply into this in parallel functional genomic and     
13:34     
neurobiological Studies have provided exceptionally detailed information about     
13:40     
the cellular composition of the brain and its interconnections and neurotypical     
13:45     
individuals increasingly also those with schizophrenia so this is something where     
13:50     
we're interested in characterizing these neurotypical and uh U neurod Divergent     
13:58     
uh brain taken together these results suggest unexpected complexity in the mechanisms     
14:04     
that drive schizophrenia pointing to the involvement of ensembles of genes this     
14:09     
idea of polygenicity rather than single Gene causation so basically you know we have     
14:17     
you know a lot of times people try to ascribe single genes to single traits and of course that's not the way our     
14:23     
genome Works especially in a complex system like the brain we have they actually in     
14:29     
this paper Champion the view of genetic ensembles or ensembles of genes so     
14:35     
multiple genes having relatively small effects on a phenotype and so this is     
14:42     
what they're talking about here in this review We describe what we now know about the genetics of schizophrenia and     
14:50     
consider the neurobiological implications of this information so this is a I if I have     
14:57     
access to this uh but this is uh a nice overview I think of what people are     
15:03     
doing in this area Okay um so yeah uh Trevor he put     
15:13     
this paper in from the bioarch this is from a previous meeting     
15:19     
um they also have a framework for mesan dopamine systems based on protective     
15:25     
heavy and learning a neural substrate for addiction and reward so those are two     
15:32     
papers I think maybe from this was from previous meeting on August 10th so     
15:38     
reference that meeting for that conversation and then uh Morgan links to     
15:43     
Ryan Smith's website at The laurate Institute uh which Dr Smith's lab     
15:50     
focuses in understanding the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying emotion cognition interactions and how     
15:58     
they relate to body interactions that's all something that     
16:03     
Trevor expressed interest in so that was back in August     
16:09     
10th um and then this is a conversation that Trevor and Morgan were having and I     
16:18     
think we had this in the meeting too about looking at uh GW and some other     
16:24     
things I know that Trevor's I talked to him about mandelian randomization and maybe doing a short     
16:30     
presentation on that sometime so that's something that's what this is referring to uh then dealing in randomization is a     
16:38     
technique that people uh I don't remember who is the inventor who'll have to inform us on this this is this is     
16:45     
graph DB this is a database uh for health data science so there's all sorts     
16:50     
of data here if you're interested that's sort of like a uh a     
16:57     
gen bank or a a ncbi for sort of EP epidemiological data I     
17:08     
guess um let's see this is oh this is a auline     
17:14     
randomization analysis uh gut microbiotic composition so this is a gut     
17:21     
microbiotic composition is causally linked to Multiple Sclerosis and this is the melan random     
17:29     
of analysis on this this is something Morgan pointed out to Trevor so he could give some     
17:35     
feedback and yeah travor said he's not really doesn't have enough of a grasp on Mr methods you know how they might be     
17:42     
applied to the microbiome so this guy George Dave Smith was the self-professed     
17:48     
inventor of melan randomization so yeah I'd like to hear more about this     
17:54     
approach um so this is a link to this new set of     
18:00     
paper or the first of a new set of papers from the Levan lab and this is     
18:05     
where uh Mike 11 says here's the first of a series of preprints that will be     
18:10     
posted over the next few weeks and this is called the multiscale wisdom of the body collective intelligence is a     
18:17     
tractable interface for Next Generation biom medicine so of course we know the     
18:23     
wisdom of the body is the name of uh Canon's book on homeostasis and it was     
18:29     
published back in like 1930s it was about 100 years ago and he talked about you know     
18:36     
homeostasis medicine and Physiology and kind of thinking about     
18:41     
like how you have these physiological set points that are you know kind of the     
18:46     
basis for we talk about most of the time we talk about homeostasis and so this is the     
18:53     
multiscale wisdom of the body so this is actually where you know they're collect     
18:59     
intelligence at multiple scales so that's that's something to check out     
19:05     
if you're interested this paper is uh on stress sensitive neural circuits change the gut     
19:13     
microbiome so this is a paper more on more gut microbiome stuff so I don't     
19:18     
know if we really have an interest in that but that's where we seem to have a fair number of papers being published on     
19:25     
some interesting topics these days there's are more videos from from YouTube that might be of interest to     
19:32     
people uh this is multiscale neuro development this I think is a a research     
19:42     
group yeah so this is a research group out of Germany where they're doing this     
19:48     
type of uh you know they're going from genes to the brain and they're looking     
19:53     
at these different scales of organization so from genes the cell types and the Brain     
19:59     
the microscale architecture of the brain to the wiring space or how the connectome is set up and then these     
20:06     
macroscale Dynamics so we go from the wiring of the connectone to the Dynamics     
20:11     
of the connectone the the functional Dynamics so this is uh you know studying     
20:17     
the maturation of cytoarchitecture connectivity and functional Dynamics across early life so     
20:23     
this is also there's a developmental component to this as well so looks     
20:29     
pretty interesting um not sure what they have in terms of Publications looks like     
20:34     
they're doing a lot of um you know they're doing tool     
20:39     
development they're doing a lot of uh different types of uh narrow Imaging     
20:47     
studies and they have sort of their Vision paper here actually this is a paper where     
20:55     
they've been able to establish some models and things like that and then uh     
21:03     
some other kind of you know putting the pieces in place kind of like what we do with developmental     
21:10     
a okay uh as another paper on connection     
21:17     
uh connectivity and and depression so we have uh you know a connecto the frontal     
21:23     
stal sance Network it's expanding uh in case of     
21:30     
depression so we see in the image here we have healthy controls and effective     
21:37     
brains we have you know showing how how this network expands and then there's     
21:44     
some other things here where you Trevor and Morgan are having a conversation     
21:50     
another paper on neurodevelopmental disruptions behind schizophrenia cognitive deficits so this is from Neuroscience     
21:58     
news neurodevelopmental disruptions behind schizophrenia cognitive     
22:03     
deficits so a recent review of genetic and population studies reveals that     
22:09     
premorbid cognitive deficits in schizophrenia such as lower IQ are largely due to neurodevelopmental     
22:16     
disruptions rather than inherited genetic variance that directly increase schizophrenia risk so these are     
22:23     
disruptions that are you know due to aspects of the environment as ects of     
22:28     
the developmental trajectory U these findings suggest that non-familial factors including rare     
22:35     
genetic mutations and environmental influences play a significant role in     
22:40     
both cognitive impairments and schizophrenia risk this challenge uh this challenges the leld belief that     
22:47     
cognitive deficits and schizophrenia share the same genetic Origins that's     
22:53     
interesting the research highlights the need to explore early neurodevelopmental disruptions     
22:59     
develop prevention and treatment strategies for both cognitive impairment and     
23:04     
schizophrenia this is the genetics of cognition in schizophrenia and it's a conceptual     
23:10     
review kind of going over um different aspects     
23:16     
of uh the genetic predisposition and cognitive impairment as risk factors for     
23:22     
schizophrenia and the factors that influence the degree of cognitive impairment and those with the disorder     
23:29     
there is clear evidence that premorbid cognitive impairment is frequently present in those who developed     
23:35     
schizophrenia and across the range of abilities or premorbid cognition is     
23:40     
associated with higher liability to the disorder so this is taken from evidence     
23:46     
uh from genetic and population studies uh this shows that premor     
23:52     
premorbid cognitive impairment is a marker for underlying neurodevelopmental risk factors for the disorder rather     
23:59     
than a uh prodromal manifestation the premorbid cognitive     
24:04     
deficit seems to be largely explained by non-familial factors rather than familial factors as mentioned in the uh     
24:12     
press release there is also evidence that neurodevelopmental risk may be better indexed by the degree to which premorbid     
24:21     
cognitive ability deviates from familial expectations than by cognitive ability     
24:26     
per se so this is again you know say re restating what was in the press release     
24:33     
or I guess the Press releas is restating this um yeah this this kind of just     
24:39     
talks about that we already went over that so this is a conceptual review just     
24:45     
kind of shows sort of their model of the relationships     
24:50     
here there's uh neurodevelopmental impairment that leads to premorbid IQ     
24:56     
familial expectation this comes from common risk a Wheels     
25:01     
rare damaging mutations the environment and stochastic factors which can be a     
25:07     
number of random factors that are involved um and then this just shows the     
25:13     
severity of impairment and then functional outcomes there's a paper genetic     
25:19     
dependent brain signatures of resilience interactions among childhood abuse genetic risks and brain     
25:26     
function so this is resilience to emotional disorders uh but we don't have good     
25:32     
signatures of brain resilience you know if you want to know anything about how we're resilient to different things in     
25:40     
mental health you know any trauma that we experience we don't really have a     
25:45     
good measure of the resilience aspect analyzing bringing responses to angry faces in a longitudinally large scale     
25:53     
adolescent cohort which is this imagine consortion we have Identify two     
25:59     
functional networks related to the orbital frontal and occipital regions as canidate brain signatures of resilience     
26:05     
and girls but not boys higher activation in the orbital frontal network was associated with fewer emotional symptoms     
26:12     
following childhood abuse but only when polygenic burden for depression was high     
26:18     
so this is where if you have high uh depression burden if you're a     
26:24     
girl there's higher activation in this frontal n this finding defined a genetic dependent     
26:30     
brain or GD GDP sign GDB signature of resilience notably the GDB signature     
26:38     
predicted subsequent emotional disorders in late adolescence extending urly adulthood and     
26:45     
generalized to another independent prospective cohort or ABCD uh our findings underscore the     
26:52     
genetic modulation of resilient brain connections laying the foundation for enhancing adolescent mental health     
26:59     
through resilience promotion so they identify these brain networks they uh do this in girls and     
27:07     
boys they find these two networks the frontal and the occipital and you know they have     
27:14     
different levels sort of triggers for resilience so that's interesting um I     
27:21     
know that people have studied resilience of brain networks in general in other     
27:27     
words if if you take remove nodes from the brain Network you know how resilient     
27:32     
is it and you know that's that's something that you can look at but looking at you know resilience through     
27:39     
sort of this behavioral metric it's an interesting yeah there's there's um I'm     
27:48     
not seeing it right now I don't know if I posted this but but you know     
27:54     
again there's this um there's this very strong relationship between adverse     
28:02     
childhood experiences and development of psychosis right yeah and     
28:09     
um uh there was a recent study uh using     
28:16     
using kids yeah studying kids um in     
28:23     
Bangladesh um who uh were experiencing     
28:28     
severe poverty and and a number of other um yeah this this kind of awful you miss     
28:37     
adverse childhood experiences yeah um but uh yeah relates relates to this you     
28:45     
know or again like like super important to look at uh     
28:54     
um you know together together with the the     
28:59     
um you know cognitive or or you know this this low low IQ um conditions which     
29:08     
which you know were really prominent in our data set from from Oxford the the     
29:14     
Adolescent psychiat Treatment you know we we had we had subjects that we had to exclude because their their IQ was less     
29:22     
than 70 oh and and yeah which which which again seems     
29:30     
strange to me that you know because it seemed to be     
29:37     
like yeah part part of the disorder yeah and um     
29:44     
uh but but you know again studying studying uh these kids that are     
29:50     
experiencing you know severe poverty and and you know Associated kind of     
29:56     
trauma again super important because of this relationship you know and um if you will     
30:06     
you know environmental relationship um much like studying these um you know     
30:13     
there was this this awful case in when Romania's um communist government fell     
30:20     
apart um there were all these kids in orphanages that had been severely     
30:27     
neglected you know and it became a really important po you know     
30:35     
cohort um to look at um both in terms of     
30:40     
just you know obviously to to you know try and     
30:45     
correct what they what had been done you know as well as just um     
30:52     
uh what was possible for the kids that had been in there the longest versus the     
30:59     
kids that they kind of only just entered into the into the program before the government fell     
31:06     
um uh yeah anyway     
31:14     
yeah I loved that the California the first California Surgeon General I don't     
31:20     
think I've mentioned this before but uh you know was only was only the position was only made     
31:29     
like eight years ago or something like that so um yeah so like this was this is     
31:36     
a woman appointed by Gavin new um uh she she was     
31:44     
pediatrician and when she BR you know they they kind of set a particular goal     
31:51     
you know as as like a focus of their of their time as as C General right and she     
32:00     
set hers um to cut uh adverse childhood experiences in California by     
32:07     
50% you know which which well yeah there's a whole bunch of things I loved about     
32:13     
that but you know from a from a um as     
32:18     
[Music] as someone who's who's talked with politicians about you know what can be     
32:26     
done for for you know making a difference in mental     
32:31     
health you know this is this is something that we know can make a difference right like so many of the     
32:37     
things that we have are kind of you know attempts to manage symptoms later     
32:43     
and certainly not not treatment right um yeah that's that's the relates     
32:53     
to to yeah some of these some of these issues you know I it's like especially     
33:00     
about the um that frontal salience paper sorry just thinking about some of the     
33:06     
papers yeah yeah like like you know it's     
33:11     
um I'm I'm look you know I understand why     
33:17     
they think that this is better than you know the 50 other papers that claim to     
33:24     
to find a a depression marker yeah yeah you know uh but um yeah I I think I     
33:34     
think we've seen so many depression markers come and go that we should start to collect you know the kind of the     
33:41     
warning signs yeah of these papers uh and as well as just talk about     
33:49     
um yeah the the effectiveness of these treat you know like like are are people     
33:56     
who have this circuit signature um     
34:04     
um are interventions better tailored to them right yeah like I I I I certainly     
34:14     
um like the the lean Williams approach or you know attempt again this is this     
34:22     
is someone who's who's been you know really leading the way in in     
34:30     
um trying trying to operationalize Precision Psychiatry and and so she she has an     
34:38     
annual symposia at Stanford where she she brings in people that you know she     
34:44     
she's gotta it's always good to see the speakers there because it's it's people     
34:50     
you know she she's she's got a great you know curated list of of people that are     
34:56     
that are um TR trying to do that in in their practice wherever they are     
35:03     
right and you know and these are potentially big researchers is part of     
35:08     
big health networks and things like that um but U     
35:15     
uh it's a real question you know how how you know just you know I I I     
35:23     
certainly want to you know some of these papers I I Mark as as like let's check     
35:28     
on this in 10 years you know like like will this you     
35:34     
know like okay so now that now if if we show this then what we can you     
35:41     
know there there these stroke treatments right where it's just like if you know the kind of stroke the person has then     
35:48     
you can give them this treatment versus this treatment want don't kill them and the other will you know absolutely save     
35:54     
their life right right like I wish I you know I don't want the the kill one to be     
36:01     
one of those options but like you know we don't have that in depression right we don't we don't have this this this     
36:07     
set of tools where it's just like we just need to figure out what the you know what what what circuit does this     
36:14     
person not have working properly you know and and     
36:20     
uh and and schizophrenia you know the the the joke is that um you know if if     
36:27     
schizophrenia was a dopamine disorder then we would have cured it in the 70s     
36:33     
something like right like like it's U it     
36:38     
uh yeah and yeah anyway but I thanks     
36:46     
thanks for going through some of those I I it's it's good to remind what uh     
36:54     
what's getting posted in there and yeah     
37:04     
I yeah I regret um being a little late today it sounds like I missed out on some really interesting discussion um     
37:12     
yeah I was gonna ask um uh just your your opinion Morgan so you know over at     
37:18     
Stanford um was the you may be familiar with the saint protocol with like TMS     
37:24     
therapy so y I was just just talking about that yeah neur X's slack yeah oh     
37:32     
interesting well um you know if One Believes some of the the numbers you know it's what like 80 plus percent     
37:40     
response rate or something so I guess I don't know um you know like the maybe     
37:49     
they like identifying that 20% that doesn't respond would be super useful but the the biomarker stuff I've seen um     
37:58     
the you know he has a startup company for after you're familiar with it where he uh they like do a bre MRI and then um     
38:08     
and then they exactly position it just over the right you know part of the left     
38:15     
I think but um uh yeah I was reading another paper     
38:21     
paper that was basically saying the biomarker um like at least the the rtmf     
38:26     
stuff is like not really youthful at all but I I don't know I mean this is you     
38:32     
know so again it's this is one of these things right where it's just     
38:38     
like when these treatments come along you know by kind of by definition     
38:44     
there's there's a lack of of a good sample size right like we you know and     
38:52     
again when I talk about like shouldn't we perhaps learn from the     
38:59     
30 to 40 Years of you know kind     
39:04     
[Music] of supposed supposed like biomarker     
39:10     
identification and and new new treatments you know like like again like     
39:17     
whatever whatever I see a ddes do uh article that's you     
39:23     
know it's about schizophrenia it's it's almost invariably it's like new new schizophrenia treatments you know like     
39:31     
ground groundbreaking treatment or something something like that right this is like how many groundbreaking     
39:37     
treatments can you have in a decade and and how how many of them in     
39:45     
20 years you know are are no longer talked about or or are are talked about     
39:52     
but like they're talked about in a Reddit you know in a subreddit um     
39:57     
people you know applying it to themselves right right which which these     
40:04     
these communities exist right so like they're they're you know like like again     
40:11     
I I try to um I try to share this with     
40:16     
with people especially in in neur attack I mean people coming into Psychiatry going to n ATT attack     
40:24     
and uh you know the the people people almost building their own     
40:30     
tdcs equipment you know and then asking on the subreddit like here here are my symptoms     
40:38     
you know what should I turn the dial up to oh my and for how long you know and     
40:46     
and you know again like I I read these papers you know um so you know it     
40:55     
does I mean I I've got I've got two two issues with Saint one um the the fmai     
41:04     
requirement I I I just find it     
41:10     
[Music] um I I find it hard to believe that that TMS can be so well     
41:18     
targeted you know like like it's it's such a big     
41:23     
blast and uh and the region that you're looking for is is somewhat well     
41:31     
identified by anatomical um you know anatomical landmarks like     
41:39     
like I feel like you can get within you know anyway it it's it's surprising that     
41:47     
fmri targeting personalization would be useful given given the modality or you     
41:53     
know given the the the the simulation technique as well as the fact that again I just     
42:00     
don't know if people control for the fact that when you're in the MRI you're lying down and usually when you're doing     
42:05     
TMS you're sitting up and and the Brain shifts and I don't know if anybody     
42:12     
controls for that but um and then yeah I mean Saints you know     
42:19     
is just just let's do it faster     
42:24     
stronger you know in a in a amount of time um you know     
42:32     
it's the numbers are are remarkable you know and and I just I hope in 10 years     
42:39     
that those those match up or or do we see what again is is has been seen many     
42:49     
times in Psychiatry where there's this this fall off you know of time in terms     
42:56     
of the effectiveness of of some of some new treatment     
43:02     
yeah as as it's as it's applied more widely and whatever it was about you     
43:09     
know perhaps the the population being studied or something like that so but you know this is this is     
43:17     
like I I of course that it's that it is seeing that     
43:23     
Effectiveness right um and as you said like like it's     
43:29     
definitely you know you definitely want to see like what is it about those others that aren't     
43:34     
responding um you know I think it's interesting to start looking at the the     
43:41     
same groups that um I mean you know it would be again     
43:47     
wonderful but difficult to do to you know take take the kinds of people that     
43:52     
get um that get uh uh recommend for ECT     
43:59     
and to to do Saint you know to to     
44:04     
randomize Saint and ECT across the same subjects right yeah and because yeah     
44:13     
because that's yeah for for a lot of     
44:19     
reasons right in terms of their they're the these are people that you know have     
44:25     
have been tried on several several other     
44:34     
drugs I guess you know is it possible that you know I just kind of view it     
44:39     
through a cical lens but um perhaps there's a realization that the the     
44:45     
primary driver of the FY might just be like you were saying the the the the     
44:51     
duration and the compressed treatment and that's just not really like the protocol probably has limitations in     
44:58     
it's like patentability and like commercialization and so I that's my     
45:03     
suspicion where the resting say fmri comes in because then it then it becomes like a whole different thing then it's     
45:08     
like you know then you have to have like a certified places and then you need to really I think you have to have like 7t     
45:15     
or at least a 3 MRI no no it's it's not nothing you know I I     
45:23     
don't think even 1s is is um approv clinically yeah oh I didn't realize okay     
45:29     
so it's got be I believe it's still it's still considered research     
45:35     
grade but but but um uh certainly 3T is fine like like     
45:43     
there's nothing there's nothing that fancy about what they're what they're asking for in terms of the skin but     
45:49     
you're you're right it is one of these things where it's just like it's it does kind of look designed     
45:58     
to be novel enough that like like it doesn't yeah it it it it     
46:07     
can uh I I don't I don't know if patented is the right word but you know     
46:13     
it it's IP can be yeah maintained um and um you know     
46:24     
again it just it's I haven't seen the the I haven't seen the     
46:32     
um the evidence in terms of the the requirement     
46:38     
of um the FM neuron navigation you know     
46:44     
but like like having spent having spent some of this this     
46:50     
week working with some neuron navigation um it's it's a little     
47:00     
uh yeah it's a bit of an art and and again I'm I'm still you know this this     
47:08     
came up in terms of the the the way the brain sits in     
47:14     
fluid uh um you know the neuralink um     
47:19     
the neuralink threads right so so nurlink switched     
47:25     
it's it's it's most recent you know they they they've done these human trials right I     
47:32     
mean I think to this point but the first the first patient you know they they remove a part     
47:39     
of the skull they have these threads that go you know and they replace that     
47:44     
that part of the skull with this with this the the device and and     
47:53     
electronics and then you've got threads that go into the tissue     
47:58     
and I think they said within quite a short amount of time I I forget now if     
48:05     
it was weeks or months but you know something like 80% of the threats had     
48:11     
pulled out right it was still it was still effective you know for the for the     
48:18     
tasks which is which is saying something um but I believe that they said it was     
48:24     
like 80% pulled because a as the head's moving that the the     
48:31     
brain is is moving right which again you know and the the     
48:37     
greatest shift is basically between lying down and sitting up right     
48:44     
and I'm pretty sure all the neuron navigation systems I've seen they take your MRI which is is done lying down and     
48:54     
they apply it to the person sitting up you know and um so I you know I I can     
49:04     
point to this this medical um what     
49:11     
it Medical University South Carolina musk not not the same     
49:17     
one uh that was doing EG in the magnet and     
49:24     
what they showed was that that they did EG in the magnet versus EG     
49:31     
sitting in a chair that the there was this dipolar     
49:37     
shift I forget the task now um I don't know if it was maybe it was just even     
49:44     
like finger tapping or something like that but it it was something that was you know pretty pretty Superior and and     
49:54     
then in the magnet they they saw this shift back like you know 20° or     
50:02     
something like that anyway it just again it it just speaks to this like is the neur     
50:08     
navigation really um and yeah yeah anyway I I I I     
50:17     
want to follow up on it you know for sure and we're we're looking at it you know there's there's a number of     
50:24     
companies here in the Bay area that are doing this um tuss you know focused     
50:30     
ultrasound and you know the the certainly The     
50:36     
Desire with Focus ultrasound is that you you better than electrical you know tees     
50:47     
or TMS you can actually you know hit a very small like like you know an ephi     
50:56     
like voxal size you know and my question then is     
51:03     
just yeah like how well how well can you hit that um in terms of of given given     
51:10     
brain shift and given you know what what what     
51:16     
um what would be a um a good demonstration you know like like in     
51:23     
terms of um functional activation     
51:28     
modulation right but it super interesting you know and and uh I know     
51:37     
one of these groups um that uh she she talked at the um California neurot     
51:44     
technology conference that's the the student run neurotech conference here um     
51:50     
I forget I think her company is sand M um anyway but they're they're looking at     
51:55     
generalized anxiety disorder with again I think     
52:03     
a I think a subcortical Target but I don't know if that's been announced but     
52:10     
the interesting thing about the subcortical targets is of course that that's where you'd expect less shift     
52:15     
like like it would potentially be on     
52:21     
that that axis would would the subcortical would move the least the the     
52:27     
the the cortical especially at the top of the head would move the     
52:33     
most I think there's an argument to be made too that some cortical targets may     
52:38     
have more evolutionary conservation with the preclinical models yeah     
52:45     
well I don't know if you saw this I I I thought this was really interesting like like um you know one of my favorite     
52:52     
YouTube channels is is machine learning Street Talk and um which usually     
52:59     
interviews machine learning people right um but um this this like yesterday or a     
53:07     
couple days ago it was Mark songs uh I don't know if you're familiar but um you know it's a neuros     
53:14     
psychologist and it was he he was talking about the     
53:22     
the yeah it was talking a lot about the differences between cortical and subcortical and and um and brain     
53:32     
stem regions talking a lot about experiments with decorticated uh cats     
53:39     
and things like that you know and and yeah a lot of good stuff     
53:47     
that that only you know it's the kind of thing that only Nur psychologists talk about like if we remove this then the     
53:53     
person can still do that you but but it's a really interesting     
54:00     
point right because um yeah I've been in some     
54:06     
strange discussions recently about you know what happens to people when they're when they're they're missing a cortex     
54:13     
and you know as he points out like you know in animals they could     
54:19     
still do quite a lot of stuff yeah and so you know maybe maybe it's not best to     
54:25     
say that the cortex is the the seed of the     
54:32     
Soul that's interesting um I've been looking quite a bit at this     
54:38     
ultrasound stuff and there are some um uh limitations with the focus     
54:44     
ultrasound stuff involves you know like the intensity and like the response time Ben     
54:51     
sorum um at Rowan University he like tried to like figure out the exact     
54:56     
Pathways of like what's going on um and there's like a there's a particular     
55:01     
protein that it targets but just in terms of of its like neural     
55:08     
activation right yeah so there's um I think it's like A6 one or a63 something     
55:14     
that's the the the Hugo um name you the gene Target um but it uh it's like this     
55:21     
uh it's expressed in a lot of neurons not every neuron but in a lot of them and     
55:27     
um it's thought to be the primary driver of like for you have to be really     
55:33     
specific when you're talking about this Focus po sound because like what intensity are you talking about what frequency what stimulus pattern but um     
55:41     
uh this seems to be the the one that you know when people are talking about clinical things that it's usually     
55:47     
driving um uh the activity but it it it's it's not necessarily really ideal for a lot     
55:54     
of um like use cases and stuff I'm sure you're familiar with son genetics this idea of     
56:00     
like introducing um new stuff so I think there's a lot of     
56:05     
interesting opportunity there and yeah I don't I feel yeah I don't want to dominate the conversation or anything     
56:11     
but yeah I would love you were asking you know what's the um like you know what's that that you know think said     
56:18     
like functional activation or you know maybe you know in common Paran killer app or something like that um and and I     
56:27     
guess I've been thinking about that I have some ideas yeah no there's definitely like     
56:33     
combining it with other kinds of you know drug delivery or um you know I mean     
56:40     
again like Focus ultrasound like is already useful you know in     
56:48     
cancer in terms of of destroying tumors right so it's just like like it's it's     
56:54     
already useful or you know like like certainly that's how I was introduced to it by surgeons that were were again     
57:03     
focused on its its tumor killing ability and then this ability to to um     
57:12     
allow the blood bloodb brain barrier to open up the bloodb brain barrier temporarily and and have it kind of     
57:19     
reheal after youve you've delivered whatever you know like like that's super     
57:25     
interesting um and and then these these newer things where you're potentially using it to you     
57:33     
know do a really targeted delivery where you know you're now I mean again build a     
57:40     
cell seminar is such great series you know is doing was talking this week     
57:46     
about um uh synthetic cells and synthetic vesicles     
57:53     
right and and the ability to to you know use these as as again these like um     
58:03     
targeted with with molecular logic or you know they've now attached to     
58:10     
something or they've now you know they've got a receptor for something and     
58:15     
then then then the vesicle opens or you know the vesicle's delivered so it's it's really interesting some of the um     
58:23     
the abilities to to say combine these um     
58:28     
um but um yeah but these are all things that again we understand kind of well     
58:36     
mechanistically right whereas like you know schizophrenia in particular or you know the early papers that we were     
58:42     
talking about or Bradley was just reading from the computational Psychiatry Channel you know is just     
58:49     
getting at these you know these issues in the genetics of of     
58:56     
schizophrenia that that relates to you know hundreds of of genes that you know     
59:02     
that are involved in neur development right and so you've got you know like     
59:09     
such a such a high dimensional space that which these are these are you know     
59:16     
um being used and and again you then you throw in kind of you know Le     
59:23     
multiscale um problem solving terms of you know so say you've got these 50 you     
59:30     
know particular alals you know that's that's just creating a situation where     
59:37     
you know the the cells will then respond in God knows what ways but you know they     
59:45     
will they will start developing differently because of those alals versus these 50     
59:53     
other different ones right you know and um yeah so it's just really you know     
1:00:02     
so so much we need to we need to do in terms of the the brain organ of     
1:00:09     
Genesis which get gets us to the other channel yeah yeah all right yeah I think     
1:00:15     
that's good yeah so we did Trevor kind of came in late but we did review the     
1:00:21     
computational Psychiatry channel so that's got a lot of good stuff in it we should try to do that more and look and     
1:00:28     
see what's there and kind of work through it like this this is great uh so     
1:00:33     
yeah and I think there's more to say about this so we should do that in the channel and maybe next week you can kind     
1:00:39     
of revisit this um maybe we'll do the brain organoids Channel next week because there's a lot of good stuff in     
1:00:45     
there as well so a couple things kind of odds and ends and then I'm going to get     
1:00:50     
into a really interesting topic on a talk that I saw this week um     
1:00:56     
the first one here is this handbook rout ledge handbook on the philosophy of scientific modeling which I that was a     
1:01:03     
really nice this is a free ebook you can download it from Taylor and Francis philosophical handbook so it's on the     
1:01:11     
philosophy of scientific modeling um and it's kind of an interesting set of topics so you know we     
1:01:19     
have different types of you know chapters on theories and models the     
1:01:25     
emergence of the mod modeling attitude uh practice oriented approaches to modeling and then you know some topics     
1:01:32     
like representation idealization uh de idealization which     
1:01:38     
means you know idealizing a problem or de idealizing a problem as they Define it     
1:01:43     
here uh models fiction in the imagination so you know if you build a model it can be hyper realistic can be     
1:01:51     
sort of uh building a you know an imaginary thing in some ways uh some     
1:01:56     
interesting philosophical topics uh Target systems minimal models which is you know     
1:02:04     
like modeling the minimal number of parts that you need to really kind of represent a system um you know in a in a     
1:02:12     
reasonable manner so a lot of times when we do biological modeling we do a lot of minimal modeling and that's considered     
1:02:19     
good enough uh computer simulations scientific law and     
1:02:24     
theoretical models the puzzle of modelbased explanation and then there's this part     
1:02:31     
on methodological aspects of robustness analysis model evaluation evaluating     
1:02:37     
different models um models data models and Big Data models and     
1:02:44     
measurement model transfer in science and then related topics kind of going     
1:02:51     
off into different areas related to modeling scientific models and thought experiments looks good models and Maps     
1:03:00     
metaphors analogies and models and of course this is stuff we talked about many times before interdisciplinary     
1:03:08     
interdisciplinarity through modeling um and then modeling in the wild part five kind of talking about     
1:03:15     
different applications of models in finance climate um different epistemic     
1:03:22     
applications and machine learning models biomedical models um modeling history the Deep     
1:03:33     
past um formal language Theory and how Network models contribute to     
1:03:39     
science so I think really nice set of chapters there this is again this rout     
1:03:45     
ledge handbook on philosophy of scientific modeling so it's a really nice reference especially for a lot of     
1:03:51     
the philosophical issues we talk about in the group here okay uh the next thing I want to talk     
1:03:58     
about is that neurom match which of course offers um their summer schools on     
1:04:05     
neuro Ai and deep learning and computational Neuroscience is now open a course in     
1:04:12     
open science so I'm glad to see this because you know this is a topic that sort of     
1:04:18     
you know there's been a lot of hype around it there you know but there isn't a a really good curriculum around it at     
1:04:26     
least not yet so this is where kind of they're getting into open science 101 to teach people how to do open science so     
1:04:34     
open science is really a practice oriented thing it's you know doing good practice to make your science open and     
1:04:41     
transparent as well as accessible to other people so that could mean you know open     
1:04:47     
protocols open papers like pre-prints um other types of things um     
1:04:54     
where you're just making your science transparent and and giving access to     
1:05:00     
people of the finished product so um the way they approach open     
1:05:07     
science is that it's a five-day course so it's like the one week so it's not as     
1:05:12     
long as the other courses that they offer uh which I think is about the right size for what we're doing here um     
1:05:20     
the first day is the ethos of open science so this is just kind of like describing you know how to     
1:05:26     
think uh about the space how people are doing things um you know in the open     
1:05:33     
science landscape you know where do you fit in a lot of times you know open     
1:05:38     
science is sort of a Continuum so sometimes groups will engage in open     
1:05:44     
science you know maybe they'll just pre-print their papers sometimes they'll you know go a     
1:05:49     
step further and um make their protocols open you know which means that you don't     
1:05:56     
bury your protocol in a paper you maybe make videos you put like interactive     
1:06:01     
notebooks together and put them prominently online and things like that sometimes people will actually do     
1:06:08     
things like you know um shery agents or um you know provide open data sets from     
1:06:16     
their experiments that's also open science so there's a Continuum of open     
1:06:21     
science um this just kind of talks about you know how open science Works what are     
1:06:27     
the principles and then what are the benefits to the people doing it so typically you know groups will do open     
1:06:34     
science to different degrees research group will maybe open up you know do one     
1:06:40     
thing in open science like preprints or a lot of things it might be heavily invested in it and so really depends on     
1:06:47     
what the benefit to the group is you know sometimes you know you can incentivize people um a lot of funding     
1:06:54     
agencies for example of you know um mandated that you know people release     
1:07:01     
their papers as pre-prints or mandated that data be provided at you know in in     
1:07:08     
an open repository so those are things ways that you know you can kind of     
1:07:14     
facilitate open science but also showing groups that there's a benef clear benefit to doing this that it produces     
1:07:20     
better science that it helps the community sort of learn from what you're doing doing and if everyone does this     
1:07:28     
it's a very virtuous cycle and so you know then they talk about the current challenges in open     
1:07:34     
science landscape so you know the current challenges basically are you know maintaining different repositories     
1:07:41     
different tools there's a cost of course to opening up your data sets creating     
1:07:48     
preprints creating preprint servers and how do we sort of overcome that a lot of     
1:07:54     
the challenges of course are also in terms of evalue career evaluation so if     
1:08:00     
you you know participate in open science you're spending a lot of time on these activities are they rewarded by     
1:08:07     
promotion and tenure committees or you know do people think that preprints are     
1:08:13     
worth citing things like that uh so there's a lot of practicality     
1:08:18     
in the ethos aspect even though it's the term ethos is used it's actually a very     
1:08:24     
practical set of consider ation um then day two is open tools and     
1:08:29     
resources this is where you have the essential tools and resources of practicing open science the     
1:08:37     
exploration of the use make share framework so this is where you you use     
1:08:42     
something you make something you share something so if I create a data set and     
1:08:48     
I put it up you know in a repository and make it open to people those people you     
1:08:53     
know I make something and then I share it and then other people can use it and     
1:08:58     
you know the idea would be that that would be reciprocal thing so other groups that might use data might make a     
1:09:05     
resource and then share it with me and I can use it so that's the idea behind use     
1:09:10     
make share and it's really you know based on this idea of a Creative Commons and so you know you're you're     
1:09:17     
dealing with the sort of the sort of the Grist for a virtuous cycle uh which is     
1:09:23     
good and then the immediate application of open science tools which of course you know where you have data you know     
1:09:30     
databases you have preprint servers you have you know places where you can make     
1:09:35     
open protocols open interactive notebooks for code things like     
1:09:40     
that A3 is open data uh so this is just kind of going through how open data is     
1:09:47     
used and how uh you know you create something like a data management plan     
1:09:52     
which is something that I think the NIH and NSF require for Grants where you     
1:09:57     
have to describe how you're going to manage your data so a lot of times when you get a grant like a large Grant a     
1:10:04     
multi-year grant but even if you have a smaller Grant if you generate data you know you     
1:10:10     
should have a management plan in place in other words if you just generate data and just use it once and dump it out or     
1:10:17     
just put it in a folder somewhere and forget about it uh that's not good     
1:10:23     
that's what they call the file drawer problem because you've basically     
1:10:28     
cherry-picked your data that you generated and then you don't let anyone else see it so it has very limited     
1:10:35     
utility and of course in a funding agency is paying for people to basically generate data you know that's not great     
1:10:43     
it's not a great use of our money and so what you need to do instead is to have a     
1:10:49     
plan we're going to manage our data we're going to sort of first of all have a method for making sure that the data     
1:10:56     
is um robust that you know you don't have a lot of problems with um people     
1:11:02     
making up data uh or less nefariously mismanaging     
1:11:08     
the data so that it's not reproducible um but also being able to     
1:11:13     
take the data annotate it curate it and then maybe share it in a open repository     
1:11:21     
so a lot of genomic data that's been a requirement for years where a few do a genomic study you usually upload the     
1:11:27     
data to um ncbi and you know it's available for     
1:11:33     
other people to use you also have a lot of metadata with it so that people can actually use it in context um and so     
1:11:41     
that's what kind of data management plan that a lot of funding agencies require and I think it's a good thing to have     
1:11:48     
just even if you're not applying for a grant because it allows you to establish a data pipeline it allows you to     
1:11:54     
establish Lish you know what you're doing with the data and how you can get the maximum use out of your     
1:12:01     
data then there's some best practices involved in sharing and citing open data which are you that's they go over there     
1:12:09     
then there's open code day for so then they get into like kind of you know you have a couple of components of a     
1:12:16     
research Grant you know you have the data collection the data generation and     
1:12:23     
usually you'll make some you'll write some code or you'll manage code to do an     
1:12:29     
analysis or to actually collect the data and so this is where open code comes in     
1:12:34     
and so then you know we we talk they talk about open code this is not this     
1:12:39     
quite the same thing as open source software because you know you're not building a you're not engineering an     
1:12:46     
software artifact but you are managing code sometimes it's you know in a you     
1:12:52     
know in a a defined program sometimes you're writing your own program but you're basically having to develop     
1:12:57     
protocols for sharing code managing code uh debugging code uh you know     
1:13:04     
refactoring code if necessary those are all part important things and then     
1:13:09     
finally Open results so this is where you're sharing your results with the     
1:13:14     
community of science you're trying to figure out how to report them so some     
1:13:21     
people just kind of use a paper format of course we can pre PR things which     
1:13:26     
means that you can maybe publish smaller chunks of results or you can publish     
1:13:31     
them very quickly and get feedback on them you can also publish you know     
1:13:39     
smaller reports that aren't um you know they're not publishable units but they     
1:13:47     
can be published as maybe things that are negative results or other things     
1:13:52     
that you find uh interesting and so this is all very nice curriculum I I teach     
1:13:59     
some of these things in my project management course I have a lecture on open data I have some things in open     
1:14:06     
science and open source software that I I like this topic and I think they've done a good job of kind of going     
1:14:12     
especially for the practicing scientist to take this onewe course so they can learn a lot about this in a condensed     
1:14:18     
way so this is happening in October November and December so they have three     
1:14:24     
sessions once a month or each month each of the next three months okay so that's uh on open     
1:14:33     
science um now I wanted to get into this     
1:14:45     
um so I went to this uh I didn't go I saw this talk on YouTube this is uh the     
1:14:53     
Santa face um series so Stannis La ulam was a flexity     
1:14:59     
theorist who was around around the midcentury and he did a lot of interesting work he's a mathematician     
1:15:07     
physicist um one he's kind of considered sort of a father of complexity Theory     
1:15:14     
and so they have this series of talks at Santa Fe Institute in tribute to     
1:15:21     
him um and one of the people who who gave a talk was David cocow who's a     
1:15:29     
faculty member at SFI and he's published this book called the complex world so this is an     
1:15:36     
introductory book to the foundations of complexity science and so uh David CAU     
1:15:42     
gave this talk he was uh you know kind of going through the history of     
1:15:48     
complexity Theory some interesting asides about like the history of science     
1:15:55     
uh you know in terms of like the way people thought about different     
1:16:00     
mechanisms so for example he made the point that like Darwin originally     
1:16:06     
thought of natural selection as sort of a steam engine and he never published     
1:16:12     
that analogy but he used that analogy in fact in 19th century a lot of people use the steam engine analogy for different     
1:16:18     
things sometimes it was on base like you know if you're working in uh statistical     
1:16:24     
mechanics at the time if you're James Clerk Maxwell you use the steam engine as a metaphor it's pretty appropriate if     
1:16:32     
you use it for natural selection maybe not so much but you know uh he so he went through some of these aspects of um     
1:16:40     
The History of Science and kind of the point of that was to show that sort of complexity theory is     
1:16:47     
born out of the theory of machines we we talked about some of these kind of     
1:16:52     
metaphors talking about the machine metaphor in particular in our uh     
1:16:58     
cognition Futures group so we've had that discussion there but I thought it was interesting in light of that but     
1:17:05     
anyways this is the book that he's written so this book is available this talk is available on YouTube more     
1:17:11     
generally and so this is what I'm going to talk about now so     
1:17:17     
um yeah so this is the The Talk The Complex world three centuries of     
1:17:22     
deliberation it's really about the History of Science leading up to complex     
1:17:27     
complexity Theory and thinking about complex     
1:17:33     
systems um this is a nice table that he had in um I think it's from the book um     
1:17:42     
this is about kind of how people have thought about systems theory different citations of     
1:17:51     
this and it's very heavy on the cybernetics which is which is interesting he just showed this uh table     
1:17:57     
in the talk so there's there are these different references that he gives and     
1:18:04     
he gives this kind of definition of how they think about Dynamic systems or complexity or     
1:18:11     
systems and you know kind of the the ontology or domain so it's in different areas of Science and then the stated     
1:18:18     
field so for example there's Rosen Bluth Wier and Bigalow this is the 19 43 paper     
1:18:26     
where they kind of uh you know I can't remember the name of it right now but this is of course a     
1:18:32     
classic cybernetics paper which isn't mentioned here but um the way they' usew     
1:18:39     
systems is are as dynamical systems with active or purposeful Behavior so this is     
1:18:44     
this paper where they talk about purpose and cybernetics um directed towards the     
1:18:50     
attainment of a goal quote unquote voluntary activity supported by feedback     
1:18:56     
and prediction and this is where we talk about cybernetic systems being extrapolative so you know cybernetic     
1:19:03     
systems have feedback there's this trajectory that's produced and it can     
1:19:09     
adapt basically to its um conditions so it's extrapolative in other words it can     
1:19:15     
any anticipate things or it can produce an Adaptive feedback uh this was of course in the     
1:19:21     
philosophy of science at least nominally and now of course it's part of this larger systems     
1:19:29     
conversation um Hayek from 1945 thought about markets he thought     
1:19:35     
about you know free markets and self-organized economies and things like     
1:19:40     
that and he was talking about systems planning through local decentralized knowledge of time and place markets in     
1:19:47     
the price system spontaneous sources of order and this is of course resource     
1:19:53     
allocation and the economy and society and this is from the economics     
1:19:58     
literature uh Weaver Warren Weaver who of course is another um he was a popular     
1:20:04     
writer but he wrote a lot about um cybernetics and information Theory um     
1:20:11     
this is actually the first instance of complexity science so this is Weaver's definition systems of organized     
1:20:18     
complexity sizable numbers of factors which are interrelated in an organ into an organic or function whole so again we     
1:20:26     
have these themes of like uh purposeful Behavior adaptive feedback we have     
1:20:35     
decentralization we have this sort of spontaneous order we have organized     
1:20:42     
complexity and uh functional holes so this is where you know we have all these themes kind of     
1:20:48     
emerging again uh weiner this is Norbert weiner in 1948 so this is not Weaver     
1:20:53     
this is weer um and this is from sort of the cybernetics literature of course more     
1:21:00     
directly uh in his definition of systems controlling functional information your     
1:21:06     
feedback to achieve homeostasis there's homeostasis stability and goal seeking     
1:21:12     
so whereas Rosen booth weer and Bigalow were talking about uh voluntary activity     
1:21:17     
and purposeful Behavior ler 1948 talks about stability and goal seeking the     
1:21:23     
similar kind of mechanism um Von Berto Lany uh who's another     
1:21:31     
basically kind of a adjacent cyberneticist did a lot of things at     
1:21:36     
General systems theory he was interested in open systems dynamic equilibrium     
1:21:42     
efficient metabolism principle of equa finality thermodynamics if you're     
1:21:48     
reversibility so he him and prene in 1947 were building on this idea of a     
1:21:54     
thermodynamic interpretation um yeah so there are a lot of these different Von     
1:22:01     
Forester gives a theory of observers description invariant objective worlds     
1:22:07     
representational systems recursive and self-re referential systems this is the     
1:22:12     
epistemology of living things Anderson's paper 1972 more is different this is a     
1:22:19     
nice paper this is usually considered the foundational paper of complexi     
1:22:24     
science um but it's basically talking about like emergence and you know     
1:22:30     
reductionism as being sort of bad and so uh in more is different the focus is on     
1:22:38     
complex systems dominated by gr and symmetries reductionism does not imply     
1:22:44     
constructionism each level requires a different conceptual structure so that sort of frames sort of the that sort of     
1:22:52     
thinking complexity science uh we have uh Herbert Simon John     
1:23:00     
Holland uh talking about you know different types of Social and biological     
1:23:05     
systems pent in asby in 1970 talking about regulatory systems feedback     
1:23:12     
control prediction inference and complexity of controller matching that of environment so this is the ever     
1:23:19     
regulator theorem paper then finally verel machano near rebe     
1:23:24     
1974 where they introduced autois which has a lot of these same features so he     
1:23:30     
goes through these different papers in different areas of Science and sort of     
1:23:35     
how they come together to inform modern complexity     
1:23:40     
Theory this is another figure where he talks about um this is sort of the 19th     
1:23:46     
century Matrix of these different themes emerging out of the work of these 19th     
1:23:51     
century luminaries uh you have Punk karea Maxwell in the Dynamics and control     
1:23:57     
corner you have Darwin Mendel and Wallace in the evolution and adaptation     
1:24:02     
corner you have Maxwell boltzman cardno Aus and Gibbs in the stat MAAC and     
1:24:09     
thermody Dynamics quadrant and then finally Bull babage and LEL in the     
1:24:15     
computation and logic quadrant so there were these four things that were happening in the 19th century you had in     
1:24:22     
in one uh you know of course we had the theory of natural selection we had the foundations of     
1:24:29     
evolutionary theory we had the foundations biological adaptation we also had the foundations     
1:24:35     
of Dynamics and control this is again the work you know math mathematics work uh Natural History     
1:24:44     
mathematics computation and logic which was again mathematics at the time and as     
1:24:50     
was philosophy had that in another quadrant and then statistical mechanics and thermodynamics were also emerging at     
1:24:57     
that time and you had a number of people working on those problems so you can see all these different areas that were kind     
1:25:04     
of emerging in the 19th century coming together in different ways to uh be a     
1:25:09     
foundation for complexity um this is a article in Aon     
1:25:16     
Magazine online that uh Croc hour wrote with I think Chris Kempy who's another     
1:25:24     
Santa Fe uh Professor Chris Kempy works at the intersection of physics biology     
1:25:30     
and the Earth sciences and together they published this article on problemsolving     
1:25:36     
matter so this is an argument um that I mean we've actually had this     
1:25:42     
conversation as well in our group um we did the stuff on physical computation     
1:25:47     
which I talked about earlier what else is you know on and off again in some of     
1:25:53     
the uh cognition features and cybernetics meetings that we've     
1:25:59     
had so their argument here is kind of I guess controversial and you'll see in a little bit why it's     
1:26:05     
controversial um Life is starting to look a lot less like an outcome of chemistry in physics and more like a     
1:26:12     
computational process so this is the argument they're making and so if you think back to those definitions of     
1:26:18     
complexity Theory you know some of those of course maybe are at directly     
1:26:24     
applicable to sort of you know what we think of as life and the evolution of life and the development of     
1:26:31     
life and some of them are less relevant but you know making the connection there     
1:26:37     
you what is the connection between say like computational processes and this sort of complex     
1:26:42     
system like life so or you know and then maybe another question is are all     
1:26:48     
complex systems equal in other words and we assume universality between all types of complex systems     
1:26:54     
we assume that a computational system is equivalent to a biological system and we     
1:27:00     
use the same language to describe it um and that would mean you know of course that life could be a computational     
1:27:07     
process or more generally that we can use the same language describe all sorts     
1:27:12     
of all manner of complex systems so this is you know their article here kind of talking about what     
1:27:19     
makes computation possible of course naturally we have modern computers and     
1:27:26     
you know digital Computing but of course it goes way beyond that you know there are a lot of different aspects of     
1:27:33     
computation uh that go back to um the jard loom in     
1:27:40     
1804 um you know if if so visiting if if you were an off-world engineer and you     
1:27:46     
were visiting Earth at different points in time and looking at the different Technologies you know we know that like     
1:27:52     
in the 1940s and Beyond we had digital computers that were pretty straightforward in terms of the way we     
1:27:58     
think of computation today but if you go back another Century in 1804 the jakar     
1:28:05     
loom was patented and maybe you know if you were an offworld engineer you would     
1:28:10     
think the computation was about the sort of the plant matter and in insect excreta used     
1:28:17     
to make the wooden frames Punch Cards and silk threads involved in fabric weaving     
1:28:22     
looms and this is is maybe a analog or a precursor to Modern programmable     
1:28:28     
machines so Alum may be a computational     
1:28:33     
device uh you know and and you can go back in history and look at other things that maybe computational devices as well     
1:28:41     
and they don't have to be you know of the sort of the modern computer they can be any sort of thing that processes     
1:28:48     
information that Pro you know you can program that is automated there are number of things you could Define as a     
1:28:56     
computer um yeah so this just kind of goes through this talking about kind of     
1:29:01     
how you know we're kind of developing biological computers we're developing     
1:29:06     
programmable DNA programmable cells things like that and of course now we're sort of straddling life so could we like     
1:29:15     
say you know maybe life is a computational process we're just simply tapping into that with something like     
1:29:21     
synthetic biology or it could be that we're hacking a that a physiochemical     
1:29:28     
system and we're imposing that sort of metaphor on the system because of our     
1:29:33     
goal so that's you know something that you know food for thought there um just     
1:29:39     
kind of talking about you know this sort of     
1:29:45     
model um and talking about how biological systems involve things     
1:29:52     
like problem solving now they we have this uh quote that we're going to talk about in a little bit and this is um     
1:30:00     
maybe a problem for this sort of point of view um genetic Evolution also     
1:30:06     
involved problem solving insect Wings solve the problem the problem in quotes of flight and so that's you know a     
1:30:13     
specific way of looking at evolution is sort of this retrospective thing and that may be a problem because Evolution     
1:30:20     
isn't necessarily retrospective in other words you could look at it is like that there's you know     
1:30:26     
there's a niche that's you know flight uh that organisms might use to get away from predators and so you know     
1:30:34     
insects might evolve wings that solve a problem but of course Evolution doesn't     
1:30:40     
really solve problems in that way um you know flight is a consequence of having     
1:30:46     
wings if you have wings that allow you to fly and you can occupy that nation and pres your Fitness then great if not     
1:30:54     
there may be no actual problem of FL so there's a problem there with kind of the way that's     
1:31:00     
conceptualized um he also talks about some of the first experimental evidence uh for for sort of     
1:31:08     
the origins of life talking about the milary ray experiment where they tried     
1:31:13     
to recreate the atmospheric conditions of early Earth and put a bunch of organic compounds in that environment     
1:31:21     
and then looked at what kinds of chemicals were synthesized and so there     
1:31:27     
they actually did actually this is a very complex sort of line of research because they did the original study and     
1:31:34     
they were able to get like you know these life you know life supporting     
1:31:40     
compounds and then of course they had to redo the experiment because they didn't     
1:31:45     
get the atmospheric mix right and then like many years later the like I guess     
1:31:52     
it was the one of the students of I think it was Stanley Miller received those materials when you     
1:32:00     
know when they were uh when their supervisors retired and they redid the     
1:32:05     
experiment and they actually got a better result they actually got a more robust result in the experiment so this     
1:32:12     
is an interesting set of experiments but basically you know this is showing that you can actually reconstruct the     
1:32:19     
conditions for early life the chemical conditions and things like that uh I guess this is pointing towards the     
1:32:26     
idea of adaptive function and so this is where you have this they kind of Link     
1:32:32     
this to problem solving more generally so you know this is maybe an artifact of     
1:32:37     
the Santa Fe Institute the way they view um you know these kind of evolutionary     
1:32:42     
systems but um and then link it to technology but problem solving me or may     
1:32:48     
not be the way to do that um and so this is really the key the core of their     
1:32:54     
argument though that this problem solving perspective is radically altering our knowledge of the universe     
1:33:00     
life is starting to look a lot less like an outcome of chemistry and physics more like a computational     
1:33:06     
process and so you know they go back to the origins of computational processes     
1:33:12     
back to Aristotle talking about you know uh     
1:33:18     
how uh functions take precedence or reforms and so going over this     
1:33:24     
uh and then kind of linking that to modern evolutionary theory     
1:33:29     
and uh you know kind of thinking about there was kind of a paradigm shift at     
1:33:35     
that point by you know where before Darwin people looked at organisms by     
1:33:41     
their material components in chemistry uh and after Darwin they     
1:33:46     
started to view organisms as defining traits uh by focusing on how organisms     
1:33:52     
adapted and evolved so in other words how they process and solve problems I     
1:33:57     
mean I don't know if that really uh follows but that's sort of the idea that they had that there is a shift from this     
1:34:04     
sort of stamp collecting sort of thing where you would just describe the organism thinking about the organism     
1:34:11     
functionally and then if the organism is is functional entity it can actually do things like process information and     
1:34:18     
solve problems and so this is something that you know also has its roots in early     
1:34:25     
Computing as well so this is the article you know goes on um kind of interesting they have     
1:34:33     
a screenshot of the Avita software so they're showing this uh artificial Life     
1:34:39     
program that allows you to evolve uh genotypes and then you know select for     
1:34:45     
certain genotypes and it runs on the basis of these genotypes that have logical     
1:34:51     
functions that solve uh that basically solve problems given     
1:34:57     
the right computational resources so they develop these competencies through these logical functions and given the     
1:35:05     
right environment of computational resources they can reproduce and dominate a population of     
1:35:13     
programs so this is um kind of thinking about these kind of programming oriented     
1:35:19     
models of Life uh Von neyman's construction replication model is a another example of this where you know     
1:35:26     
you can build a an evolutionary model that's tring complete in s life and it     
1:35:33     
looks very similar to the kind of life that exists in in the natural world uh yeah he talks about Constructor     
1:35:42     
Theory which is of course uh from David Deutch uh from 2013 this is the paper     
1:35:50     
here on the archive this is constru structor Theory and it's basically a     
1:35:57     
theory that seeks to express all fundamental scientific theories in terms of a dichotomy between possible and     
1:36:03     
impossible physical Transformations those that can be caused to happen and those that cannot so     
1:36:11     
definitely um you know there's there's some sort of assumptions here that um     
1:36:18     
you know you have to kind of buy into so this is you know this kind of goes on for a while talks about free energy and     
1:36:26     
things like that but I guess the point I wanted to make is that this is I think a pretty good article pretty well staking     
1:36:33     
out this claim um and but you know it isn't without its criticism so this is     
1:36:39     
Philip ball who's a science writer writes on a lot of chemistry and     
1:36:44     
biology um and he was reviewing this article and he was kind of making some points here this is on X of course um     
1:36:53     
and so uh the first post is is a post of the LinkedIn paper and then the second     
1:36:59     
post here is I am less sure whether it's right to see The evolutionary process as     
1:37:04     
problem solving for example insect Wings solve the problem of flight which was in     
1:37:10     
the paper so the idea that insect Wings respond to this problem this abstract     
1:37:15     
problem in the world that has to be solved which isn't necessarily the right Framing and that's what Philip says I     
1:37:22     
don't think that's the right framing not least because it has a strong whiff of theology so we talk about theology in     
1:37:30     
cybernetics and how that's basically you know sort of um you know that there's     
1:37:36     
this sort of uh you know force that guides the things towards the future or     
1:37:44     
you know that there's this necessarily temporal organization that     
1:37:49     
you know leads necessarily leads to things so this is one of the problems with this kind of framing of solving     
1:37:57     
problems that don't really exist in the world like you know there may be an advantage to evolving things that allow     
1:38:03     
you to fly but saying that it's the problem of flight is very much like a     
1:38:09     
technological phrasing it as a technological problem and in doing so you introduce this theological     
1:38:15     
explanation which is to say that there's maybe some sort of computational force     
1:38:20     
in the universe that governs everything and that you're kind of solving for that which is you know not necessarily the     
1:38:27     
way I you know I don't know you just have to be comfortable with that or what but it's a point of view that uh you     
1:38:35     
know it may not be justified um so Philip then later says     
1:38:41     
here flight is not a problem that Evolution must solve that's a retrospective construction so this is     
1:38:47     
like you know retrospective you're thinking about the thing that the effect and thinking about it as the cause     
1:38:54     
so if life is starting to look dot dot dot like a computational process is that     
1:39:00     
life the organism or The evolutionary process so you know is the evolutionary     
1:39:05     
process life or is it the organism that's life that has an evolutionary process because it's interacting with     
1:39:12     
other organisms or its environment so those are very different     
1:39:17     
considerations so you know it's not just the problem of um you know that it's     
1:39:23     
tileology and that it's retrodictive but it's also um this sort of you know     
1:39:29     
conflating life as the environment or as The evolutionary process with life as     
1:39:35     
the organism if we if we go back to the m e experiment you know what is the thing     
1:39:42     
that sort of um you know is there a computational process underlying that     
1:39:47     
well it's a chemical problem there's chemical synthesis going on there's an environment which the chemical synthesis     
1:39:54     
operates but there's no predetermined outcome and you know you could probably     
1:40:00     
run that experiment many times and maybe get different results so is that uh also     
1:40:06     
a computational process we know that there are a lot of papers on replaying the tape of life and you know there you     
1:40:13     
can look that term up and you can find different papers on it and it's basically if we could run the experiment     
1:40:19     
of life again and again and again uh if we could run the experim expent of life from the origin of life     
1:40:25     
on Earth to the modern world uh of of the tree of life you know what would the     
1:40:31     
outcome always be the same and the answer is no it wouldn't and that's I think pretty much the     
1:40:36     
consensus because evolution is extremely contingent and extremely stochastic and     
1:40:42     
you have these you know you're going to have this variation in what's generated     
1:40:48     
and there's a case to be made that there's certain phenotypes that occur over and over again but that's you know     
1:40:55     
that's maybe a problem of constraints more than of retrodiction well anyways the last thing     
1:41:01     
he mentions here is that most of all it feels crucial to maintain a distinction     
1:41:06     
between what evolution does and what living things do I have no problem with     
1:41:11     
considering organisms as problem solving as goal directed entities they must be     
1:41:18     
okay so uh if you're if you're saying that organism are gold directed entities you     
1:41:24     
must say that they're problem solving although thinking about like organisms as problem     
1:41:31     
solvers behaving in an environment an immediate environment is much different     
1:41:37     
than thinking about their evolution or many generations and because there are     
1:41:42     
you know different aspects like you know genotype phenotype there's Behavior but     
1:41:48     
also because um those conditions change a lot and so problem solving is sort of     
1:41:55     
the idealized case where you know you can you can solve a local problem like finding food surviving in a certain     
1:42:02     
environment but if the environment is always changing then you're just you know is that really that does that     
1:42:08     
problem solving really give you this huge uh you know advantage in in the     
1:42:13     
long term so this is some interesting points here to think about um and so     
1:42:21     
yeah that that was my experience with um that top yeah if you don't mind going     
1:42:26     
back um the the the one just before that this one um yeah yes yes taking high     
1:42:36     
exper this is yeah I don't really think this is related yeah I I mean but you     
1:42:43     
know so so sorry I mean one it's just it's a funny username yeah I do I mean as well as the fact that the     
1:42:51     
username is at is is freder a check     
1:42:57     
mark you know again Twitter's Twitter's changed yeah stuff but it is it is so     
1:43:05     
hard and Philip Ball's a a biologist right     
1:43:12     
he's a science writer who's got a background in chemistry and biology he's chemistry chemistry I think yeah anyway     
1:43:21     
um uh uh you     
1:43:28     
know yeah I mean it's it's it's an interesting question in terms of how do you take the     
1:43:35     
the if you take the multi-organism view yeah right or like     
1:43:41     
like the the the geneal you know like like the the many     
1:43:47     
generations right yeah like what would you say evolution is doing     
1:43:53     
right right like like you know and     
1:43:58     
and you know at any particular time you wouldn't     
1:44:04     
say evolution is problem solving but right the the the the the history gives     
1:44:12     
you something that is is certainly adaptive right right or you know like     
1:44:19     
like it is it's a learning of right or     
1:44:24     
um well so um     
1:44:30     
it's so I I I hate to say maybe taking hyek seriously is     
1:44:38     
right well I think a good way to think about it it maybe a good way to think about learning more generally but it's     
1:44:44     
just you know that that you do fall into these kind of language problems right you know in discussing it and and and     
1:44:52     
these kind of difficult taking or you know that language     
1:44:58     
has the language around Evolution's operation is problematic yeah     
1:45:05     
because it's it's yeah you have to like see it from a very big picture yeah um     
1:45:14     
and and think about it in non or organismal organism term yeah yeah     
1:45:23     
yeah it like like it's not about yeah um it's about the the the     
1:45:30     
generations um and certainly sorry that's I don't know if you can hear my daughter screaming upstairs I don't know     
1:45:38     
why um yeah that that it's it's I've been     
1:45:46     
like Dennis Noble's been dropping lots of videos on YouTube and     
1:45:53     
and you know and again it's it's sometimes I think he as well fall you     
1:46:01     
know that that what we're actually what we're having here is a failure to     
1:46:07     
communicate um and uh that it's it's     
1:46:14     
U just just that well yeah the the wing is a pro yeah the Wing makes it even     
1:46:22     
more complicated yeah I mean one way to think about Evolution and maybe learning more     
1:46:27     
generally is like you don't you don't always succeed in fact it's it maybe it's very rare that you succeed so if     
1:46:34     
you have a population of organisms and they're all sort of problem solving um you know some will problems     
1:46:40     
solve better than others maybe or maybe they'll just find a solution that's better and then finding solution doesn't     
1:46:47     
necessarily mean it's just driven by Behavior you have you know uh genes for     
1:46:53     
certain traits you have certain variation in the environment across the population and so you get these     
1:47:00     
opportunities to sort of proliferate and solve a problem when in fact it's not solving a problem the way we might think     
1:47:06     
of it in terms of cognition alone you know we think about problem solving as like an active process of you know uh     
1:47:15     
cognition or that there's some over that there's a goal that the organism is moving towards when in fact all they're     
1:47:22     
trying to do is survive immediate in their immediate environment so over time that compounds     
1:47:29     
but it's not like you know there's this overarching thing where oh yeah I got to evolve to be like a beetle or I have to     
1:47:36     
evolve to be a human you know it's not right absolutely right I mean this this     
1:47:43     
became clear um I guess it was like two weeks ago and seeing this company that     
1:47:50     
that is trying to to make these you basically brainless organisms yeah right     
1:47:55     
like like trying trying to edit you know what they what they want to do is make     
1:48:02     
is you know edit Anatomy yeah and there's you know and of     
1:48:09     
course that's that's just not how that's not how you know genetic     
1:48:15     
control of of morphogenesis works yeah right so so     
1:48:22     
you know what they ended up doing it's it's super interesting and you know happy to     
1:48:30     
talk about it at some point because again it's interesting from a you know     
1:48:35     
because it's they they're focused on brain it's definitely of interest of neurod development kind of standpoint     
1:48:43     
um but it's interesting as just a developmental biology standpoint in the     
1:48:49     
sense that again there's not some blueprint where you know know here's the body and just like okay now I got to     
1:48:56     
make this right right um the the the the the expression patterns are you know     
1:49:05     
much more abstract than that right and and you know and in the in kind of in     
1:49:11     
the noble you know context like like are making all you know not they're not even     
1:49:18     
making these assumptions about it that they just they just know that if they turn on then that because of context     
1:49:26     
that they will you know get the the right thing because you know because     
1:49:32     
they had an ancestor that did that ancestor was able to survive right but     
1:49:37     
but that you end up with these you know again like and this comes back to of     
1:49:43     
course you know schizophrenia and it's it's genes it's risk factor genes where     
1:49:49     
it's just like like you've got hundreds of these genes that are making all these kind of like micro decisions in a sense     
1:49:58     
um but but those expressions at the right time um are what give us the the     
1:50:05     
the morphogenesis that we we you know expect or or again like the problem     
1:50:11     
solving is good enough that we get an organism that can behave right yeah uh um and you know and     
1:50:21     
again like and each one is a miracle or you know like each one's pretty pretty     
1:50:27     
damn special but uh yeah yeah it's it's as usual as soon as we     
1:50:35     
get into like theological discussions it just it it becomes philosophy right yeah     
1:50:43     
yeah well yeah no so like that that that we end up arguing about terms you know     
1:50:50     
like you know well I think we can revisit the whole comp you know nature is computation     
1:50:56     
argument because we've talked about this before where you know is nature sort of computational and if it's not     
1:51:03     
computational can we still understand it with like the sort of the complexity     
1:51:08     
Theory view or the sort of the computationalist view uh where you know maybe we can draw an analogy with some     
1:51:15     
other system maybe even like an engineered system and kind of use the same arguments I think that's important     
1:51:22     
important because you know we you know maybe there is some universality at the level of like systems Dynamics you know     
1:51:30     
it's like all systems basically if you evolve it's there's a certain type of     
1:51:36     
complexity where things recombine or there things that sort of form you knowa     
1:51:41     
independent trajectories you know there all these different aspects that you can list of     
1:51:48     
like an evolutionary system that are maybe analogous to um you like a     
1:51:53     
generative computational system I mean you know it's not the same thing but it has enough of the same components to     
1:51:59     
make it look very similar that's like with a Vita you know that's the thing that a lot of times you look at it and     
1:52:05     
it looks like life it's not a living system but it looks like it right right     
1:52:10     
so it's doing something similar but what is it right right yeah yeah these these     
1:52:18     
yeah I mean right     
1:52:24     
these these these useful abstractions that that are capturing are capturing     
1:52:29     
something yeah you know um for sure for sure     
1:52:37     
um so I was just thinking of another     
1:52:43     
um it was it was interesting tissue talks this this     
1:52:49     
week from the kind of uh     
1:52:54     
one one of the people I think that kind of maybe founded the whis Institute um     
1:53:01     
anyway it was a synthetic biology talk but but he covered things like you know     
1:53:07     
the foundation of of madna and things like that but just talking talking about     
1:53:13     
like on one hand our ability to engineer biology and on the other hand our our     
1:53:21     
real ignorant still in our ability to engineer biology and     
1:53:26     
that that that there's this this this complexity that     
1:53:32     
um or certainly you know that that life is able to to do all these things in     
1:53:42     
such a you know both sophisticated and yet you know     
1:53:49     
beautiful way that we still have no idea how to how to control at this point and     
1:53:57     
and um uh it was a really nice talk I forget the     
1:54:07     
um it was a really nice overview of synthetic biology since like     
1:54:13     
2000 yeah     
1:54:22     
yeah if we could drop that in the slack I think it' be great yeah yeah I'm just I'm just     
1:54:28     
uh uh Trevor do you want to say something or Jesse Yeah I just gonna add     
1:54:34     
a couple words that's all right so um the I mean it was kind of a little to     
1:54:40     
but not so much you know the I think survival can be um framed as problem     
1:54:46     
solving so yeah um there's kind of been this um schismogenesis of trying to     
1:54:52     
separate the two I one could call perhaps some of the arguments here um like high you know if you were to make a     
1:54:59     
hierarchy this would just be higher up on the totem pole of uh perhaps survival yeah um and so it's just you know what     
1:55:06     
level of abstraction are we talking about I guess the other thing that was just occurring to me is um you one of     
1:55:12     
these ideas of Chris field and I don't know how much of it is originally from him I linked to it well I guess in the     
1:55:21     
computation of psychiat Channel Morgan and I were having a conversation I linked to his YouTube on it but he     
1:55:27     
basically um you know he he really is a a strong proponent of this idea of um Quantum computation and especially on a     
1:55:34     
cellular level and so um when we start kind of drawing these lines of you know organismal level versus cellular I think     
1:55:42     
that can be potentially problematic because I I I suspect there might be a way of looking at this where you even um     
1:55:49     
you might be able to go smaller than a cell but you know starting on a cell cular level um there may be evidence of     
1:55:55     
computation happening um in pursuit of goals perhaps like survival and um one     
1:56:02     
of the other main point that uh field making is that um he he has a     
1:56:07     
theoretical basis for thinking that um uh cells or life had to master time     
1:56:14     
before mastering space and so um which is a really curious thing because you     
1:56:19     
know when we're talking about these problem solving a lot of these things are like a Time based goal and you know     
1:56:25     
if we're listening to what these etiti are saying they're saying you know life actually did that first before it     
1:56:30     
started doing space and so yeah just just some food for thought yeah     
1:56:37     
yeah yeah I yeah I not like I know Chris Field's work but I'm not like that     
1:56:43     
familiar with it so that would be interesting to go back into some of the work he's done on     
1:56:49     
that yeah I mean he's he's very he's very interesting um or you know very     
1:56:55     
broad researcher like I I saw that he gave a a talk this week at the toos     
1:57:01     
Institute okay he gave he gave a talk this week on the toos Institute on     
1:57:07     
um the the identity operator I think was the title of his     
1:57:13     
talk yeah to look up yeah yeah yeah I was     
1:57:20     
trying to find I I'll try and find that link um Bradley okay for the the tition     
1:57:26     
talk this week the next thing or the last thing I'm going to talk about is uh     
1:57:31     
so there's this uh interesting special issue of uh I don't I don't know what     
1:57:37     
Journal this oh this is um so it's this interesting special     
1:57:44     
issue of this journal possibility studies in society and again you know in our uh in     
1:57:51     
our cognition Futures group we've talked a lot about an activism and like how you you know an     
1:57:59     
activism is you know you can define an activism but it's like it's applications     
1:58:05     
are kind of all over the place but uh this is an interesting kind of approach to an activism so this is um     
1:58:13     
a thematic section of possibility studies in society volume one issue three this is from last year but it's um     
1:58:21     
you know I don't think we've seen this before so I wanted to go over it a little bit um so this is uh this you     
1:58:28     
know an editorial here enacting chance and the space of pro possibility so this     
1:58:34     
is about like Pro the intersection of probability Theory an     
1:58:39     
inaction and some other topics uh one of these papers this one     
1:58:44     
here is called surprise why an activism and predicted     
1:58:49     
processing or parting ways case for improvisations by Sean Gallagher this is     
1:58:56     
an interesting article because you know we've talked about also about predictive processing and sort of that whole millu     
1:59:03     
it's kind of hard to you know get a sense of uh what these things actually     
1:59:08     
mean but you know articles like this kind of bring them together give us sort of a view of that scientific space so     
1:59:17     
this paper it talks a little bit about an activism and predictive processing     
1:59:23     
and why they're sort of incompatible in an area like improvisation so well let's let's read     
1:59:31     
the abstract um so by improvisation they mean something like jazz or dance     
1:59:37     
improvisation um where there's a skill informed selective uncertainty that is you need to know a     
1:59:43     
lot about your craft about different Traditions within your genre and have skilled knowhow but you don't know where     
1:59:50     
you are going or what you're going to do where where the music or movement will take you so you know we know that like     
1:59:58     
in improvisation you just have this you know skill you know kind of you know     
2:00:04     
that you're going to do it uh but you don't know how the structure of the     
2:00:10     
thing your performance so you just use the music or the movement and it just you build     
2:00:16     
upon so um the abstract says can we explain how the various factors     
2:00:22     
of knowledge skill habit environmental constraints and affordances interact or     
2:00:30     
integrate improvisational performance so these are different aspects thing things     
2:00:35     
that sort of get integrated in an improvisational performance in     
2:00:41     
attempting to explain how this integration takes place I'll consider two possible approaches the first is     
2:00:48     
predictive processing which is of course a very common model in um in decision     
2:00:55     
making in in um actually it's used the what an active     
2:01:01     
inference and an activism which of course is you know we know what an     
2:01:06     
activism is for if you've been in our cognition Futures gr I'll argue that     
2:01:12     
predictive processing which on a neuroscientific view conceives of the     
2:01:17     
Mind as a as set up to avoid surprise so we talked about surprise last week and     
2:01:23     
what that is it's basically where you know you want to avoid being surprised     
2:01:28     
by S like a predator or being surprised by something you don't know anything about you want to that's why you learn     
2:01:35     
because you want to learn to avoid these surprisal events and you can predict the     
2:01:41     
next move that you need to make and it's very structured so it's very much     
2:01:47     
against I guess maybe improvisation or maybe it's supports improvisation if you     
2:01:52     
looked at in a different way um but basically predictive processing     
2:01:58     
basically uh you know is conceives of the Mind as being that's the imperative     
2:02:05     
of cognition is to avoid these surprise events and so the author here argues     
2:02:12     
that it will not be able to explain improvisation if it remains true true to its own principles I'm not sure what     
2:02:19     
that means but basically if you're trying to avoid surprise and     
2:02:25     
improvisation is about like these surprising things or having this we     
2:02:30     
responding to surprisal in a different way than predictive processing uh Smooths it out then I     
2:02:38     
guess that's true in contrast they'll argue an activism as a form of embodied     
2:02:44     
cognition that takes the explanatory unit to be the brain body environment so     
2:02:49     
in other words an activism is basically a form of embodied cognition that deals     
2:02:54     
with interactions between the brain and body and the environments surrounding that can offer a better explanation for     
2:03:02     
improvisation I'll also argue that the notion of habit is Central to this account so this kind of goes through     
2:03:09     
some of this it talks about um you know in an improvisation one aims for     
2:03:15     
surprise selfs surprise so improvisation is all about surprise surprising     
2:03:20     
yourself with what you generate and this is you know a technique that allows you to achieve     
2:03:26     
novelty such as the breaking of habits or the avoidance of unusual     
2:03:32     
affordances or the avoidance of usual affordances so this is where we avoid     
2:03:37     
affordances and break habits and that's the sort of novelty you get with     
2:03:43     
improvisation and this these events are surprising because you usually uh adhere     
2:03:49     
to habits and you use a for all the time and that's sort of normal Baseline for     
2:03:56     
cognition uh but also part of what allows the possibility of surprise is Chance the source of which may be the     
2:04:03     
environment or other performers so this kind of goes through predictive processing it goes back to     
2:04:09     
helm holds uh thinking about perception as an influential process it models this     
2:04:15     
process in terms of prediction eror minimization which begins with the assumption that the brain has no access     
2:04:20     
to the external world so this is where you're just predicting things in the     
2:04:25     
brain so when you get an input you're responding to that input by minimizing     
2:04:31     
the surprise of the input um by means of perceptual inference neuronal processes represent     
2:04:38     
that World by forming probabilistic hypotheses about the world based on an internal     
2:04:44     
basian which is of course statistical but you know the brain I mean we could argue that it's not really on the     
2:04:52     
statistics we use but like it basically replicates a basian model hierarchical     
2:04:58     
generative model that a constructs formed by prior knowledge or priors so you have this prior information that you     
2:05:04     
know it acts as a basian prior and it compares the prior knowledge with the     
2:05:12     
incoming knowledge and it tries to smooth that out in reconcile the prediction structure can     
2:05:18     
be quite complex involving a nested Cascade Precision weighted predicted processes in the brain if the     
2:05:25     
predictions don't match the sensory input the brain revises its model and corrects its inferences in order to     
2:05:32     
minimize prediction errors or the conflicts between sensory input and the internal model which is the previously     
2:05:39     
held um knowledge sensor input being the new uh newly observed     
2:05:46     
knowledge so this kind of talks about uh predictive processing and it's goal of     
2:05:52     
reducing surprisal surprisal is a subpersonal personal version of surprise     
2:05:58     
so I guess this is where it surprise is identified by this basian     
2:06:05     
process um the idea that an organism or brain has no direct access to the world is usually explained in terms of a     
2:06:11     
mathematical formalism called a Markoff blanket which defines the boundary of the cognitive system so that's the idea     
2:06:19     
is that the boundary is within the brain you don't have access to the environment the Markov blanket or the statistical     
2:06:26     
model only incorporates what you encounter as sensory information versus     
2:06:32     
what's already there and you don't have that environment to you know you can extend the markof blanket to include the     
2:06:39     
body and parts of the environment um and so you know maybe you know this is a     
2:06:44     
debate within the a field maybe you can do this uh seamlessly maybe you can't so     
2:06:50     
there is this debate within the field whether as to whether the markof blanket extends outside the brain um and so you     
2:06:58     
know some of this is so according to Jacob hoe which is this citation here     
2:07:05     
there is strict closure um PM should make us resist conceptions of a mind     
2:07:10     
World relation um instead pem reveals the mind to be inferentially secluded from the     
2:07:17     
world it seems to be more neuros centrically skull bound than it the embodied or extended perspectives and     
2:07:25     
action itself is more an inferential process on sensory input than an an active coupling with the environment so     
2:07:31     
there's a position that uh predictive processing is sort of uh sort of the     
2:07:38     
opposite of the sort of embodied or extended view of cognition so you know     
2:07:44     
and but some like Andy Clark of course endorses a more embodied perspective and     
2:07:50     
but also that there the brain is some in some sense isolated from the world so in     
2:07:56     
an activism there is no boundary really it's kind of like the the main unit is the brain body coupling we don't think     
2:08:03     
about the brain as being secluded in any sense other than maybe physically or     
2:08:09     
physiologically so this is again kind of Andy Clark's take on this um and go so     
2:08:18     
this kind of goes through how predictive processing you know whether or not it can explain     
2:08:24     
improvisation um and so you know according to Andy Clark to deal with rapidly and fluently     
2:08:32     
with an uncertain and noisy World brains like ours have become masters of prediction surfing the waves noisy and     
2:08:37     
ambiguous sensory stimulation by in effect trying to stay just ahead of it     
2:08:43     
um you know so this is like uh basically this is about prediction and     
2:08:50     
but there's a of course this noisy aspect to it an ambiguous aspect predictive processing allows us to keep     
2:08:57     
on top of that so you know it's hard to see where um you know improvisation fits     
2:09:04     
into this um Michael and wolf apply this account to the example of coordination     
2:09:09     
required for ending a song during an improv improvised performance how do several musicians decide when to end a     
2:09:16     
song without agreeing to it in advance um and basically     
2:09:22     
uh I guess you know this suggests they have a kind of a model here they suggest     
2:09:28     
that the musicians priors include a set of stock endings that are common across the performance Community these     
2:09:34     
operating as constraints on prediction and this together with embodied in gestal cues can help navigate the end of     
2:09:41     
the performance that limits a prize for the performers so they can coordinate their behavior so there are different     
2:09:48     
ways you can sort of use predictive processing to model improvisation but there are other people     
2:09:55     
like Frozen nagami and Ryan who point out that you know predictive processing     
2:10:00     
simply cannot explain novelty and improvisation novelty and surprise are not coextensive Concepts you both are     
2:10:08     
important features in improvisation as such if predicted processing is to help our understanding     
2:10:14     
of how imp improvisation functions will need to include an account of novelty     
2:10:19     
but there are a couple of problems one is that uh according to predictive processing an organism's main aim is to     
2:10:26     
maintain its organization IE St why we talked about this that this is an immediate sort of goal or an immediate     
2:10:33     
sort of uh uh you know imperative uh and this means by which an     
2:10:41     
organism realizes the same as through prediction or minimization which is equivalent to minimizing surprise as     
2:10:47     
much as possible number two novelty is something that by definition increases surprise moving outside the standard     
2:10:54     
statistical regularities faced by an organism and it's resulting ASAS and model so these statistical regularities     
2:11:02     
you know can a basian model deal with surprise events or non normal events so     
2:11:09     
you know this is a fundamental question you can argue that okay we can deal with     
2:11:15     
um you know improvisation using predictive processing but you have to kind of jump through these hoops     
2:11:21     
to try to explain how this is done that there are all these like you know possible endings to the story and you     
2:11:27     
just pick one and they're all equally likely and you know this sort of thing so this is one of the problems it's you     
2:11:34     
know really dealing reconciling that basy and model of smoothing with these surprise events with these non uniform     
2:11:41     
events that um will characterize surprise accordingly an organism will do     
2:11:48     
its best to stay away from novelty as much as possible that's basically those are the basically the three points on     
2:11:55     
how predictive processing is incompatible with explaining improvisation uh so you know this is     
2:12:01     
where they kind of get into this uh idea that predictive processing and enactivism are incompatible and that     
2:12:08     
it's leading to the sort of split in the community and so you know this kind of     
2:12:14     
talks about um you know this debate more and then finally Andy Clark argues that     
2:12:21     
it could go either way environment and cultural practices May provide limits or may enable creativity so remember Andy     
2:12:29     
Clark is the one who argues that predictive processing can extend outside the brain to the body to the environment     
2:12:36     
and so even there where you're kind of reconciling embodiment with predictive processing you know you really don't get     
2:12:42     
a clear answer U the question remains how does it work when it enables creativity and then almost as if on Q is     
2:12:50     
power effects are further explored in the work by an activist sympathetic to predictive processing for example these     
2:12:57     
references which are uh reinberg 2018 revelt and kerstein 2014 Gallagher 2013     
2:13:06     
the author of this paper and then Clark 2018 I this is uh surfing uncertainty or     
2:13:12     
something like that I don't know if it's the book or not related paper but uh     
2:13:17     
that seems exactly right the focus on embodiment a and environmental coupling     
2:13:22     
actually pushes us away from PP towards more inactive accounts and so then this     
2:13:28     
goes through in activism and dynamical processes um getting to predicted     
2:13:35     
processing and or inaction kind of considering kind of more about this     
2:13:41     
reconciliation or how they're they're incompatible and then uh talking about     
2:13:48     
improvization as the sort of the summary here and this is sort of a related paper     
2:13:54     
this is Anderson and kerstein this is actually a new paper from topics and cognitive science this also talks about     
2:14:02     
predictive processing but from the roots of rational constructivism so this is play and cognitive development from     
2:14:09     
rational constructivism to predictive processing and I'll just simply read the abstract of this paper but leave it up     
2:14:16     
to you to go uh read it so this is from to topics and cognitive science this is a brand new paper uh I think from this     
2:14:25     
current issue um so this is uh kind of building on this idea that you know there's a     
2:14:32     
connection between predictive processing and an activism but also rational     
2:14:37     
constructivism um as a way to sort of you know think about how predictive processing fits into some of these     
2:14:44     
different types of uh creative or you know extended     
2:14:49     
approaches um so the abstract reads it is widely believed that play and     
2:14:54     
curiosity were key ingredients as children develop models of their world     
2:14:59     
there is also an emerging consensus that children are basian Learners again we have this basian model that's you know     
2:15:06     
in children basy and learning who combine their structured prior beliefs     
2:15:11     
with estimations of the likelihood of new evidence to infer the more most probable model of the world an     
2:15:18     
influential school of thought within developmental cycle ology rational constructivism combines these two ideas     
2:15:25     
to propose that children learn intuitive theories of how the world Works in part by engaging in play activities that     
2:15:32     
allow for the Gathering new information for testing their theories so we're talking about Basi and     
2:15:39     
learning um which is uh using structured prior beliefs combining this estimations     
2:15:45     
of the likelihood of new evidence um and this is how you know     
2:15:50     
they model Child Learning um there are still however at least two     
2:15:57     
pieces missing from rational constructivist theories of development where rational constructivism has so far     
2:16:03     
devoted little attention to explaining why children's preferred form of learning play feel so fun enjoyable and     
2:16:10     
rewarding in basy and approaches are definitely not that I'm just kidding uh     
2:16:16     
rational constructivism may suggest that children are curious and like to play because reducing uncertainty and     
2:16:22     
learning better theories of the causal workings of the world is enjoyable which you know I mean if you're a scientist     
2:16:29     
sure uh what remains unclear however is why reducing uncertainty in play is     
2:16:34     
interesting fun and joyful uh so this is you know again     
2:16:40     
we're reducing surprisal reducing uncertainty in play uh why is this fun     
2:16:45     
and joyful so in other words what children are doing is they're learning to reduce their surprise through this     
2:16:51     
basy in process and but play has this feeling of being enjoyable and fun and     
2:16:56     
rewarding but all you're doing of course with rational constructivism is reducing     
2:17:01     
the amount of surprisal in this basian model through play so you know that's     
2:17:07     
the the Paradox uh what so um second so     
2:17:12     
second rational constructivism may have looked how children during play will take control and manipulate their     
2:17:19     
environment sometimes an effort to create ideal niches for surpris extraction so this is where you're     
2:17:25     
actually again like with um improvisation there's this imperative in     
2:17:31     
play to extract surprise from the environment to manipulate the environment those are not compatible     
2:17:38     
necessarily with the basian one sometimes this is for developing strategies for making the world fit with     
2:17:44     
their predictions so you know to play you play with the world basically you try to figure out how things fit     
2:17:51     
together in the world and in doing so you have to do all these sort of improvisational techniques all these     
2:17:57     
anti- surprisal minimization techniques these missing elements from rational constructivism can be provided     
2:18:04     
by understanding the contribution of play to development in terms of predictive processing an influential     
2:18:11     
framework in cognitive science it models many of the brain's cognitive functions as processes a modelbased probabilistic     
2:18:18     
prediction so I think what they're saying is IR rational constructivism uses this kind of basian Model S     
2:18:26     
surprisal minimization but then the solution to that is to apply predictive     
2:18:32     
processing and in the first paper of course they said that for this very thing predictive processing was     
2:18:38     
incompatible with something like an activism so that's that set of papers     
2:18:46     
those two papers that special issue I think that raises a number of interesting questions in um like     
2:18:52     
cognitive science and predictive processing and in     
2:19:00     
development yeah but yeah looking forward to the     
2:19:06     
links I always feel you should give out the     
2:19:11     
links like two days before so we can have a chance uh um but super interested     
2:19:19     
in the in the second just because you know because my background cognitive     
2:19:25     
development and um it's um I forget now the experiment     
2:19:33     
that they did with with you know non-human primates but um you know     
2:19:38     
whether they have a mother that has a um like terry cloth     
2:19:45     
um like outer layer you know they they basically make this This Mother Out of     
2:19:52     
wire mesh yeah and and and then they have the the mother with them you know B     
2:19:59     
basically like wrapped in a towel or or just left as the mesh     
2:20:06     
and and again the you know so to to this point of like     
2:20:13     
why is play enjoyable right you know like like you know why why why is the     
2:20:21     
soft and     
2:20:26     
um yeah why why is the soft needed you know     
2:20:33     
yeah like like it's not certainly the     
2:20:38     
the authors don't actually explain that they just     
2:20:45     
um yeah Jesse you want to say something     
2:20:53     
um I mean there's a lot of things that I could say um I'm sort of uh mentally     
2:21:01     
fatigued from all this stuff in my mind isn't really I don't feel very sharp so     
2:21:07     
like there's actually a lot of one if you account for that there's a whole bunch I'd want to say like I I I think     
2:21:13     
this is a nice a really nice like I I really think this is a a very     
2:21:21     
appealing flow of conversation from complexity to learning to surprise so     
2:21:28     
like like applause for that like I I I really enjoy that I'll go back and watch     
2:21:33     
this and think a lot of things from from complexity to to the bit about um all     
2:21:40     
the go the gold driven stuff like I have earlier comments about gold driven stuff and I I don't I don't think I'm saying     
2:21:47     
anything that interesting but but one of the things that just was really pressing on my mind during the whole     
2:21:52     
conversations like I I know I know for us I think it's     
2:21:57     
kind of almost taken as a as in this the people right now and and having a     
2:22:03     
discussion I don't think I think we're pretty     
2:22:09     
um there's a very um     
2:22:16     
self-aware humility or epistemological humility if if you will or even a     
2:22:21     
practicing of Unknowing uh which is from a very different field of study but     
2:22:29     
like what I wrote in in there what like the first comment was sort of like I think I always find it kind of funny     
2:22:35     
when certain conversations about even computation which is weird     
2:22:42     
for me to say but like goals and and solutions and inputs and outputs it also     
2:22:47     
feels very much like not I don't know if it's really if I'm saying the same thing as basically like on torana 1970 biology     
2:22:57     
of cognition this all these supposing of goals are just by a third person and     
2:23:03     
they don't have anything to do with the actual person experiencing it like I guess it's similar to that but also just     
2:23:08     
sort of the the framing of what is a goal like all the goal of the cell is pro problem solving the problem of fight     
2:23:14     
solving the problem of XYZ is like like they they have their use and they also     
2:23:21     
just like it's a nice it's a nice it's a convenient way to think about it for     
2:23:26     
someone for an entity that sees things up the frame and scope and timing and     
2:23:32     
like the metrics like the means we have but I think there I appreciate that     
2:23:37     
there's also sort of a humility of what what those limitations are um so that's sort of     
2:23:45     
that whole thing but but going and you know this is kind of out of context now     
2:23:53     
so I'll just leave it at that but going on to the the other one and and the     
2:23:59     
improvisation and play um I think I think there's a lot of really interesting things there that we've     
2:24:05     
talked about I I took up the quote the avoidance of usual foran and that fits really well with the     
2:24:11     
play and boring stuff too and I think I think on one level like like I think there's a very um     
2:24:21     
like oh what drives you know Evolution life I think to some extent it's you know yeah there's just an an aspiration     
2:24:28     
of avoiding certain things and and doing other things because it's available I     
2:24:34     
think because it's there to do is sort of sometimes the reason and I don't like I don't it's it's it's both you know you     
2:24:42     
can make it sacred or you can make it profane or you can make it nothing like like that's you know but but I you think     
2:24:51     
like going specifically to human beings and play like human being what is what     
2:24:57     
is play interesting to the human beings as we understand them and and even even     
2:25:02     
to an extent the whole Dove you could go you could dovetail very strongly or you     
2:25:08     
could you could have a segmented conversation about oh and what's it like for like Mir Divergent minds or     
2:25:13     
developing minds or a mind at this stage of development or a mind that has this particular take on you know things     
2:25:19     
things that are rewarding and enjoying and I think I think I think reward is sort of a weird term to use here but     
2:25:26     
what is playful or exciting to certain people and that's certainly not a uniform thing um but still like the ba     
2:25:34     
base mechanisms of different affordances novelty um different ways of applying     
2:25:42     
things and different sort of you know     
2:25:48     
um the Verity of the experiences around those things is interesting well at the same time understanding that like yeah     
2:25:55     
like there is sort of a uh you know there there's there's a     
2:26:01     
definite wanting to avoid certain things um whatever you know that comes up too     
2:26:08     
uh something happened even even in in this is a very almost trivial example     
2:26:14     
but something happened this weekend like a sports thing happened that had a very specific outcome     
2:26:20     
that's like oh I immediately had to just disassociate from I can't deal with this I don't want I don't want discussion     
2:26:27     
about it because it's just so like not rewarding for me at the level of     
2:26:33     
Engagement that I have yeah but that's also like a very particular driver     
2:26:38     
of uh you know that we that came up to you gonna say something sorry no I was     
2:26:45     
the same oh sorry yeah I a lot of really     
2:26:51     
really really fun sequence of going through all all of like the last I don't know if it was like 40 minutes now or so     
2:26:58     
but just as was a very fun uh sequence and it kind of it was nice because it reminded me of things that I haven't     
2:27:06     
um I don't know focused on for a bit so yeah thank yeah it's all improvisation     
2:27:12     
that's all it is that's why that's why the readings aren't out to days ah time pretty much yeah     
2:27:20     
uh definitely thinking about the you know just thinking about my own kids and     
2:27:26     
and like how how much of that play is um is playing roles you know and     
2:27:37     
and yeah just you know like feeling feeling like     
2:27:43     
you're yeah doing doing this thing that you're supposed to be doing you know     
2:27:50     
yeah [Music] think having having a     
2:27:55     
purpose I think I think that's one of the that's kind of goes back to what I was saying too like I think I think from     
2:28:01     
a human level and how we I think there's sort of a like like the bit about I     
2:28:06     
think one of the the papers started with oh the alien comes from the 1960s 40s and they see whatever I think an Al I     
2:28:12     
think I think a true like alien or even more so like     
2:28:18     
completely in in sort of the Michael 11 uh let's think about things from     
2:28:24     
really different uh you could say sci-fi but like there different like different     
2:28:29     
conceptualization of what it means to be an entity or a living machine or whatever and stuff like that like I     
2:28:36     
think a I think I think there's something very important to keeping in mind that um from an     
2:28:45     
entity that is very different let's say     
2:28:51     
one of the things that would I suspect become and maybe will     
2:28:58     
become present more evident to like quote unquote us like the human beings in the future is is is the how much     
2:29:08     
basically it's Bas I'm trying to bridge from what what Morgan just said but how much there's this the role playing the     
2:29:15     
purpose the the social impact on our interpretation of a lot of things and     
2:29:22     
not saying that it is or isn't valid but more like there are lenses that don't     
2:29:27     
have that that I think human beings are     
2:29:33     
often biased away from if if that makes sense and who could say like I'm I'm I'm     
2:29:41     
all this is totally theoretical but I feel like there's sort of in terms of like a lot of the stuff I     
2:29:47     
said in the past I don't know month about like vanish points I think there's Vantage points to be had that have     
2:29:53     
useful like lines of sight or Vision but also like very important Vantage points     
2:29:59     
that can exist that are not as beholden to that and don't deeply shape some of     
2:30:06     
the conceptualizations of in that way and and I'm not even saying like It's     
2:30:12     
tricky because I'm not even saying they I'm not I feel like so much of this     
2:30:17     
language that I'm using gets turned into well yeah of course Like Richard Sutton we can't we have like like the that's     
2:30:25     
the the bitter problem like you can't don't program in anything it's like yeah yeah yeah yeah okay computation sure and     
2:30:31     
like let's figure out the code and let's let's build the thing and find it own way yes but but even more so than that I     
2:30:37     
think there's sort of a a layer of     
2:30:43     
um you're not quite getting far enough     
2:30:48     
away so I I'll leave it at that a lot of fun provoking stuff though yeah yeah why     
2:30:56     
don't we uh call it a day and uh I I'll send the papers out I know it's like     
2:31:02     
hard to but I I sometimes I kind of don't know what I'm GNA do yeah so uh     
2:31:07     
yeah all right so all right see you next week thanks care bye bye

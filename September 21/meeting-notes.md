## NOTES:
Jesse: progress on grants and other activity.

Trevor: Americorps. Invisible illness. Datasets and projects.

Shubham: University project --- working on a final-year project. Photonic imaging.

* device, measure energy levels through fingers.

Morgan: working on some consulting. 

* adolescent psychiatry, adverse child experrience ~ development of psychosis.

* Poverty in Bangladesh study. 

Overview of synthetic biology since 2000.

* survival can be framed as problem-solving -- what level of abstraction?

* Chris Fields -- Quantum computation @ cellular level.

* can we say computation as sub-cellular but not at the organismal level?

* life -- mastered time before mastering space.


Surprisal, predictive processing, and non-uniform Bayesian modeling.

* why is play enjoyable? Is it the soft materials, or the improvisation?


Multi-organism view of evolution -- what is it doing?

* history is adaptive., shows a type of learning. Generations.

* brainless organisms -- edit anatomy. No blueprint.

* Schizophrenia -- many genes making micro-decisions. Good enough "solutions".


Tissue talk -- Weiss institute. Ignorance on how to engineer biology.


ML Street Talk -- Mark Solms. Cortical/sub-cortical (brainstem regions).

* decorticated cats, can still do a lot of stuff (emotional responses).

* combine TMS with frug delivery, tumor-killing.

* build-a-cell -- synthetic cells and vescicles.

* understand things well on a mechanistic level.


Genetic ensembles: 100s of genes are involved in a high-dimensional spaces; multi-scale problem solving.


Two issues with SAINT:

1) fMRI requirement (TMS -- can it be so well-targeted?).

2) population-specific.

Neuronavigation systems:

* brain sits in a fluid --> Neurolink switch -- 80% of threads have pulled out in human trials.

* as the head moves, the brain moves.


Dipolar shift between lying in a magnet and sitting up.

* TFUS -- focused ultrasound. Better than TMS, TES. Can you hit a voxel-sized patch?


Romainian Orphans (important cohort to look at).

* how can we make a difference in mental health?

* frontal salience paper. Is it a novel depression marker? Better tailored interventions.


Check on these papers in 10 years. Long-term lessons.

* don't have circuit parsing tools in depression, schizophrenia.

* if schizophrenia was dopamine-driven, we would have cured it in the 1970s.


Goal-driven stuff, suprisal.

* goals, solutions, inputs, outputs.

* solving problem of x,y,z (way to frame problem, but not a natural kind).


Avoidance of the Usual Affordances

* play as reward (why is it fun?)

* how much role-playing is neccessary? Alien scientist model.

* vantage points -- not as beholden.

Jesse Parent says:
For later: there's something about the goal / problem framing that smacks a bit of "unreliable narrator", even if only from the perspective of that there's some anthropomorphism around framing or identifying a goal/problem/solution/output. 
Jesse Parent says:
"the avoidance of usual affordances" , yeah, is a key concept to me re the last 20 minutes of discussion

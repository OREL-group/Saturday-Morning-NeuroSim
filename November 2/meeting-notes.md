## TRANSCRIPT
     
0:02     
hello morning morning all     
0:09     
right um so let's get started um are there any updates or things to mention     
0:17     
before we get started we had our D.A worm meeting this     
0:23     
week and then we had our cognition Futures meeting that was our first meeting a     
0:32     
while and we covered our paper on bson for that uh so that was     
0:39     
good Hussein uh did you have any updates to     
0:45     
give or yeah yeah yeah uh hi hi guys happy Saturday yeah um so yeah really really     
0:53     
happy with the pro being made on the computer tomography project and uh we are now getting another paper together     
0:59     
hope to get published by the end of the month Bradley Bradley should be on board of it it should be me Z and Bradley     
1:04     
probably the three of us um particularly the results of the mar algorithm Mar I     
1:09     
how all right showing how the Mart algorthm can work and the simulations would go through with the context of PR     
1:15     
noise so that's why we need your um expertise on that with the brother no so yeah I've got the plan together I'm     
1:21     
performing simulations right now Z and I are going to be meeting twice a week in the next three or four weeks so it's going to be a lot of work um other news     
1:29     
I'm balancing this balancing the work for that startup based in California um we still are not we're not     
1:34     
public yet despite the fact that it's been over a year now um and that's how the things happen that's how the things happen so we just got to be patient keep     
1:40     
working keep trying your best um but yeah yeah that basically is what     
1:47     
it is so yeah um also working on a few other things here and there um I'm     
1:53     
making a video game in AR video game U sorry I'm getting aggressive I don't know if you just want to keep me to keep     
1:58     
this oral stuff but oh know that's fine you can say whatever yeah thank     
2:05     
you I'm I'm making an augmented reality video game as part of a uh a contest for     
2:12     
nanch so basically nanch so that's the company behind Pokemon go um they made they use augmented reality they use     
2:19     
um they they they made like the augmented reality interfaces which Pokemon go was based off of VPS technology for location based like um     
2:27     
like like games and stuff but they basically CH update that with Pokemon and with without adding Pokemon be like     
2:32     
hey what do we make people catch and battle the Pokemon throughout the world and stuff too so Niantic just released     
2:37     
their Niantic Studio which is like they're more um excuse me like     
2:42     
making one of the one of the easier more straightforward ways of letting people create augmented reality experiences     
2:47     
right from their browser from their computers themselves even if you're not like the most technical coder even if you don't you can't really for to waste     
2:54     
so much time cing things the ground up all the time and 're having a project like a cont a competition to make a     
3:01     
um to to just use the software the best rate possible so I'm making a game called Data Hunters where you um     
3:08     
collected battle creatures where they um where their their attacks and their abilities and what they say and do is     
3:13     
based off data science and statistics context Concepts I think it's a great way to um like one of them would be an     
3:20     
example of like a reg regression model type creature which which has attacks that are like linear or     
3:27     
polinomial and the different attacks and the abilities deal damage based off the concepts from statistics and data science so like the linear attack may be     
3:34     
um may be very consistent in dealing damage but it's not so powerful maybe     
3:40     
it's just like a very simple straightforward attack like very high accuracy attack with low variance like a     
3:45     
like a linear aggression model like the VAR so I think it's a really great idea to teach     
3:51     
people about stats in math and data science from a um from an interactive immersive augmented reality point of     
3:57     
view so yeah that's good     
4:02     
so that's great thanks for the update um yeah yeah but overall sorry back to the back to the RBD project got off the     
4:08     
phone with the p attorney this past week he's very happy very excited with things yeah that's great I've seen you     
4:16     
putting updates in the um in one of the channels there the one you made     
4:21     
for uh the project for the Imaging project uh breast cancer CT so I was     
4:29     
it's always fun to watch those updates yeah yeah exciting stuff really really really a lot of exciting stuff more     
4:35     
importantly just like for me on a personal level um I'm really really proud and happy I've been able to get this together to be mature to be     
4:41     
confident to be regulated about this and to really more or less own this as what     
4:46     
I'll be given going forward so yeah that's great     
4:53     
yeah so this is the learn M conference this is from     
4:58     
2023 uh this was held in Huntington Beach California um and this is I I think this     
5:05     
was associated with the bergson paper in cognition Futures because we were     
5:10     
talking about memory learning in memory mainly where memory is stored in the     
5:15     
brain and the typical model is where you have you know the file drawer model     
5:21     
where the hippocampus is involved in looking things up in the file drawers of     
5:27     
the uh parietal cortex and this paper we were reading uh argued     
5:34     
that actually if you take a ecological psychology perspective it's actually not     
5:42     
you know you can actually link memory to action and to sensory processing and so     
5:49     
it was an interesting take on it but anyways so this was a conference I think     
5:54     
the most recent learn M conference and I was just looking through I was wondering about the state of the field in terms of     
6:02     
like what wording in memory what's going on in that field and so this is uh     
6:08     
something it's hosted by the center for the neurobiology of learning and memory um and so you know that's where     
6:15     
it was held and then the program uh let's see we'll look at the featured speakers so you know we have a lot of     
6:24     
speakers here on different topics um anesthesia associ of Lear     
6:30     
learning uh frontal cortical circuits and reward learning uh sex differences in     
6:37     
learning uh targeting metabolism to enhance cognitive resilience during     
6:43     
aging um how memory guides value based decisions how moments turn turn to     
6:49     
engrams in the brain uh prediction error and memory     
6:56     
updating and so forth so they have some pretty good also aective learning as well so     
7:02     
they had some pretty good topics there uh so yeah this is uh sort of the state of the field so this was I think Morgan     
7:10     
put this in the U in the slack so thank you Morgan for     
7:17     
pointing that out well yeah yeah the the the paper actually has um video links to     
7:23     
the 2018 meeting which paper was that the the     
7:28     
bergon oh okay the one the one we covered okay so     
7:34     
they actually cited the meeting what was the context of that I can't remember one of the speakers videos was actually a     
7:42     
reference in the paper so this is the actually Robins is the author and it was     
7:48     
the bergson memory paper this is it here yeah so this is the well this is the     
7:54     
abstract um so this is the is experience St in the brain a current model of     
7:59     
memory in the temporal metaphysic of bergson so this is Steven Robbins uh and then talking about     
8:05     
bergson this is exia math which is I guess a philosophy     
8:11     
Journal uh so this is you know kind of talking about actually linking memory to     
8:17     
Consciousness and experience so it's interesting how you know they're kind of taking a different view from     
8:24     
this uh the things that you might find at this conference which are very much you know clinical and you know in the     
8:31     
sort of cognitive science milu of learning in memory and you know the     
8:37     
reinforcement learning type uh approach and kind of expanding     
8:43     
it out to this more philosophical and consciousness-based um approach so     
8:51     
that's interesting um yeah and I don't yeah it's okay we     
8:57     
don't need to get into the paper I think that's that's good so I talked to Stefan     
9:04     
diaty um this week in an email and he sent me uh a link to a group at the     
9:12     
University of Illinois I wasn't familiar with i as was kind of familiar with their work but not their initiative that     
9:18     
they've started out this year um so this is a new scientist article on this work     
9:26     
so Stefan veretzky was used to do when he was in the lab he did a lot of work     
9:32     
with brenberg vehicles and you know the stuff that we were doing     
9:38     
developmental brenberg Vehicles back in 2019 2020 and he's since uh gotten you know     
9:46     
an advanced degree in bioinformatics and he works in Germany in bioinformatics and and     
9:54     
biomedical um you know science so you know he's done a lot of he's put out     
10:01     
several papers since then and he was interested in this project here which     
10:07     
I'm going to talk about now so this is an article uh 880,000 Mouse brain cells     
10:14     
used to build a living computer so this is um an a micro electrode array that     
10:21     
you know is where they grow the neurons in a culture and they allow the connections to grow and then they use it     
10:27     
for computation they stimulate the cells they recorded the output of the cells     
10:32     
and they can um basically uh you know do all sorts of     
10:39     
computations with it so this is where you have an an array of 880,000 mous     
10:44     
spring cells and uh this is where they needed to build a simple computer that can     
10:51     
recognize patterns of light and electricity it could be eventually used in robotics so I don't have the um     
10:59     
subscription to this but I'll I'll just read this first paragraph So a computer built using tens     
11:06     
of thousands of living brain cells can recognize simple patterns of light and electricity it could eventually be     
11:13     
incorporated into a robot it also uses living muscle tissues so you could map     
11:19     
the signals to muscle tissues in a robot and provide feedback from the environment and use it as sort of an you     
11:26     
know sort of the the brain part of that sensory motor     
11:31     
loot artificially intelligent algorithms inspired by the brain called neural networks have been used for everything     
11:38     
from chatbots to searching for new laws of physics uh normally these algorithms run     
11:43     
on conventional computers but Andrew da at the University of Illinois and his colleagues wondered whether they could     
11:50     
be instead they could instead use actual living brain cells so that's kind of the     
11:56     
project and so this leads to this uh group at the University of Illinois this     
12:02     
is uh funded by the NSF this is MIND in vitro and so they actually     
12:09     
have uh it's a group of researchers uh I don't know how many universities are     
12:15     
involved but I think mostly at the University of Illinois and they have this is sort of their experimental setup     
12:22     
where they grow the neurons in an an electrode array and then they record     
12:28     
from the neur neurons and they stimulate the neurons and they achieve this Clos Lo feedback between the neurons and the     
12:36     
environment which is basically whatever they're stimulating it with so you could use say like a video game or you could     
12:44     
use you know uh pulses of light where you could do a lot of different types     
12:49     
set up a lot of different types of uh closed loop systems to you know do these     
12:56     
computations with so their sort of statement here is can     
13:02     
Computing systems be built out of living neurons can they achieve basic homeworks of cognition such as learning attention     
13:10     
curiosity and creativity so pervasive in biology yet elusive in modern Computing     
13:16     
um and then they talk about how you know uh can we build these kind of neural     
13:24     
Compu neuronal computers that can be programmed instead of just stimulated and orted from so this is another thing     
13:31     
we'd like to do um and we could have a system that grows heals learns and     
13:37     
explores and so that's you know that's kind of the goal here is to build that     
13:42     
kind of system and then by shifting from digital rigid architectures to plastic     
13:47     
cellular substrates we trade off speed accuracy and exactness or statistical     
13:54     
robustness extreme parallelism healing growth and Superior Energy Efficiency so     
14:02     
there's they're kind of identifying this trade-off between the things that are     
14:07     
associated with I I don't know if they're associated with neural networks but when you compare them with like you know     
14:14     
brains or populations of neurons we have speed     
14:20     
accuracy and exactness you know you get Exact Solutions that are optimal you get     
14:26     
accuracy and you get speed and then it's always difficult I think it's always difficult in many ways um you know what     
14:32     
what exactly are referring to right I'm even trying to get pantic about sematics here you know it's it's really like um     
14:38     
ESP with terms of terminology from that like which direction are you going in so I'd like to see more on that basically     
14:43     
what I'm saying is are you optimizing from biological standpoint to be more artificial or in the other direction right so um I appreciate I appreciate     
14:50     
that and I think um the more unified term for for those more general concepts that can be translated more easily and     
14:56     
effectively there's like it's um it's it's it's tough it's tough right like um     
15:01     
so yeah yeah like going from The Balancing Act or the uh like like a seesaw one one six away from the other     
15:07     
to to something where they both they both you know they both right it's more     
15:13     
altruistic more Dynamic more um yeah yeah yeah cool stuff cool stuff yeah so     
15:19     
yeah that's that's basically and then they're so they say rather than Boolean logic these post vman systems will     
15:26     
harness the compositional Dynamics of billions of neural elements to generate out of the box emergent forms of     
15:34     
computation so that's the other thing we're dealing with a bonan architecture in the artificial systems and a yet to     
15:42     
be determined computational Paradigm for the biological     
15:47     
networks so that's that's basically what they're doing so they have that that's basically they're about and then the     
15:54     
people uh so there a bunch of people involved in this a lot of people from     
15:59     
the University no John begs from Indiana um and Nicole Martinez from     
16:07     
Stanford uh a couple another person from Stanford was great B was great I took I     
16:13     
took a couple physics classes I so okay yeah that's good yeah is he is he still     
16:18     
is he still in Indiana yeah I think so okay cool cool yeah yeah Okay cool so yeah and then uh     
16:28     
one of the people here the pi is Matia gazola and so Matia Gaza this really     
16:35     
interesting work with in sort of mechanical engineering and building soft     
16:40     
interfaces uh biological interfaces he has a really nice website here I don't     
16:46     
like you know basically he's doing all this stuff he's doing the mind and vitro stuff he's doing the stuff with viscous     
16:52     
streaming which is where they you know uh like put things in fluids and and you     
16:58     
know uh do some engineering around that flu num flow numerics this is numerical um     
17:07     
phys bioh physics um and I'm trying oh this one is     
17:12     
the soft creatures which is actually a set of Publications they've done on this     
17:18     
uh soft robot which basically is uh analogous to an octopus so they have     
17:26     
this uh octopus robot that has like you know it's made of this sort of this Soft     
17:32     
Robotics Paradigm where they use soft materials and they've I guess eventually     
17:37     
want to put this sort of artificial mind in it artificial brain that has you know     
17:43     
biological properties so it's really interesting stuff um thank you Stefan     
17:49     
for pointing that out I should have known about that more but I don't I'm not familiar with this group so much um     
17:57     
so yeah that's good um you mind dropping a link in the     
18:03     
chat for that oh for which which link oh the the center yeah     
18:11     
yeah so drop a link for the [Music]     
18:18     
center and then drop a link for the gazola lab actually I'll just     
18:25     
put in maybe the one for soft cre fees and then you can look at that     
18:33     
website so that's those are the two references yeah great so Morgan have you fulfilled your     
18:41     
tooth fairy     
18:49     
duties yes yes but now I'm now I'm just     
18:54     
a well it's now I realized that my wife and actually done that and we had we had     
19:02     
a miscommunication last night so but um yes all     
19:09     
settled give give me I need a few more minutes okay yeah so let's see     
19:16     
um yeah I guess Jesse will be joining us here uh so you know going back to the     
19:22     
slack um I I know that like we've of course we under the tyranny of um     
19:30     
of slack and their parent company in terms of like having access to archives     
19:35     
and things like that and I haven't been able to you know build a a proper or get     
19:41     
a proper sort of nonprofit status yeah I know but it's hard to migrate everything     
19:47     
but anyways um SL SL slack was supposed to replace email because people would spend like two or three hours a day     
19:53     
checking their emails instead of getting work done oh yeah so they're like why why don't you do slack instead you know people do they spend four or five hours     
19:59     
in slack every day now so you they didn't solve the problem of email they just they just made it even worse     
20:05     
because I would procrastinate so much more in slack compared to my inbox so oh yeah yeah well yeah yeah it's it's it's     
20:13     
the it tries to be professional but it lacks the functionality of Discord and it you know yeah yeah     
20:21     
yeah I think Discord emerged because you know of gaming so it was like kind of     
20:26     
you wouldn't expect a gaming tool to be more efficient than the business tool     
20:33     
well I mean if they wanted for gamers who play video games in real time you cannot afford for example any sort of     
20:38     
latency any sort of um suboptimal performance so Discord was already engineered from the get-go with that in     
20:44     
mind slack was more so like like hey um we want something to be professional to present to workplaces to things like     
20:50     
that and it ended up just lagging behind an Al functionality so the the game the     
20:55     
game developers like they made something better yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah     
21:02     
um so I'll go to the and I've been promising to do this for a while going     
21:07     
to the uh brain organoids Channel and the Brain organoids Channel     
21:13     
we've got some pretty good uh stuff in here we haven't talked about it in a     
21:18     
while so sorry yeah but my my apologies     
21:24     
though I I will say that um um     
21:29     
Ci's orac channel has perhaps taken um     
21:35     
um taken over in terms of organized references oh okay wellow uh I mean     
21:42     
there's there's good stuff there for sure uh I would just want to add Sergio     
21:49     
Pasa at the Stanford you know stem cell center um has a new paper uh I'll find a     
21:59     
link just one second here but all right has a new paper with     
22:05     
a a four um four organoid assembl     
22:11     
oid okay um um and I which which could     
22:16     
be a new a new record um anyway but um I I'll     
22:24     
I'll add a few links um from from orac um just to just to make sure that we've     
22:32     
got it kind of fully synced okay yeah you could put it in the channel and then     
22:37     
by the time you get it in we'll be down there so okay so this is uh uh LinkedIn James     
22:44     
Glazer in LinkedIn James Glazer of course is from Indiana and he does a lot of the multiscale modeling and the copy     
22:52     
cell 3D stuff and we've talked about this a lot in uh Diva worm so this is     
22:58     
you know kind of Diva worm related but this is a talk series on uh multiscale     
23:04     
modeling and viral pandemics so they do this glim print series uh and so I guess     
23:10     
these are announced on this LinkedIn page um and you know this is an interesting set of talks we've talked     
23:16     
about a couple of of specific talks in dorm so you know it uh I'd like to     
23:23     
actually explore it more you know haven't had the time to kind of uh get my hat around like some of the talks but     
23:30     
yeah so that's that's one re that's a good resource uh for looking at actually     
23:36     
you know in Diva worm we talk a lot about multiscale modeling and biophysical modeling and so Susan is     
23:43     
interested in that and of course um Morgan as well and so you know that's     
23:49     
something that if people are interested in collaborating on with respect building models um that would be you     
23:57     
know something we'd be interested in we've also you know tried on a number of     
24:02     
occasions to try to build models in Cy cell 3D and I know Susan went to the     
24:07     
copy cell 3D thing this summer and uh so we're we've never been     
24:13     
able to get that off the ground I remember visiting the uh bio complexity Institute at Indiana almost nine years     
24:21     
ago now to have a talk on Diva worm and you know we haven't really ever been able to do anything with compy s 3D so     
24:30     
yeah it's been a struggle see because I I I I I met Glazier back in 2017 I took     
24:35     
a class under him like 2016 2017 speaking from my apologies you speaking from copy 3D's point of view there has     
24:42     
been a lot of a lot of progress that's been really slow if that makes sense yeah and things things were tough I know     
24:48     
like um like he himself I I don't remember specifically what it was whether it was like funding or just like     
24:54     
the overall directions of the project and where things were going and a lot of researchers getting a bit frustrated or     
24:59     
um with uh with the direction of things in some ways so you know uh like it it     
25:05     
was what it was I remember so I took I took a class under him which was basically about using compy S 3D yeah     
25:11     
like I think it's was like some like comp computational classic something like that something like that yeah um     
25:17     
probably something similar like um but yeah he uh it was it was what it was it was him uh him and Zer deer Robert deer     
25:25     
from the from the physics department and they were just many different takes on     
25:30     
where things were going that's that's what I particularly remember so yeah yeah the the bio complexity Institute um     
25:37     
and where things went with that or how the professors of the faculty were there with that um that was that was an     
25:44     
interesting one too that was a great one too I also remember like there was a lot of movements from physics to the new engineering school there was that going     
25:50     
on too yeah so I I IU Bloomington started their engineering school back     
25:57     
in6 2016 2016 yeah follow 2016 and to differentiate it from Purdue which you     
26:03     
know it's like oh you're Indiana you want to study engineering you should go to Purdue or like rose homman or iy somewh similar I IU did not have an     
26:10     
engineering school I Bloomington was more known for like like liberal arts or like like basic Sciences like life scien     
26:15     
like physics and stuff but the the engineering school itself um there was a lot of push for that there's definitely     
26:20     
a lot of push for that um to make it different from what Pur offered but still make it like really appealing like     
26:27     
there were different there was like neural engineering there was like like bio bio engineering which would be different from like BME biomedical     
26:34     
engineering which allue um so they were try there was definitely a lot of uh a     
26:40     
lot of discussion on where things like Cy cell 3D and the bio complexity Institute would fall and I think there     
26:45     
was a lot of confusion with some things there too so meanwhile I'm just like you know studying physics and just trying to     
26:51     
graduate and see what I want to do next so yeah yeah but yeah that that's that's that's basically what I remember from     
26:56     
how things were about seven or eight years ago so yeah yeah well I mean you know we we've had like people interested     
27:03     
in it and you know there sort of like a learning curve to any modeling platform and then you have to find a good problem     
27:11     
to apply things to so yeah you yeah that's always the challenge in doing     
27:16     
like a lot of good simulation work is having the right kind of representation     
27:21     
the right problem and then app you know getting it to work I mean even in my     
27:27     
experience from my background coming from someone who studied bi informatics um there was there was just a lot of uh     
27:34     
a lot of hype for things like the Human Genome Project and a lot of things really did not meet that did not meet     
27:40     
that and I feel like maybe in terms of the computational scientific research world people began become be began     
27:47     
becoming very risk averse to just posing deep questions like hey can we just     
27:54     
mathematically simulate how an octopus moves and use that to apply to everything and they're like     
27:59     
you know you want money to perform simulations and work with data that's great but you have to be realistic it's     
28:05     
more so about like how realistic things are and how trustworthy people are with like giving giving funding and devoting     
28:10     
time and energy to stuff like that so yeah yeah so um that's yeah that's there     
28:18     
and then uh we had this uh paper here which is uh towards learning a     
28:26     
foundational representation of cells and jeans this is um uh Mohammad L volani     
28:33     
and this is just I guess an opinion piece on how we can build F I guess     
28:38     
they're going towards foundational models of some type where you're trying to learn this foundational representation of cells and genes so one     
28:46     
of the problems in biology and systems biology but also in like applying     
28:52     
machine learning biology is this idea what is the representation we should be     
28:58     
using so a lot of you know there are a lot of ways you can represent say a cell or the relationship between genes and     
29:05     
cells and so they're kind of giving their take on this which of course     
29:10     
involves some sort of Transformer um you know putting in like having a single cell and having a bunch     
29:17     
of genes and then running a Transformer finding a gene embedding which is     
29:23     
basically where you've got similar genes and dissimilar Gene and then cell     
29:29     
embeddings where you have different cell types and so then you have these embeddings and you can map I guess one     
29:35     
to the other and you know you're training it on D I guess physiological     
29:40     
data and out pops the you know and and this is all based on scrn so you're     
29:47     
dealing with uh like single cell transcriptomics so you have very precise     
29:53     
data with respect to single cell types so you can build you know repres representations from single cell types     
30:00     
of the genes involved in whatever you have similar genes and then you have these cell embeddings which are all the     
30:07     
single cells that maybe constitute a a a brain or a liver or a lung and then you     
30:14     
can build from there so it's it's really kind of an interesting take although I think it's that's a long-term Vision     
30:21     
because as you know you know we collect single cell data we have a lot of single cell data out there now the question is     
30:28     
can you make sense of it and that's been you know usually when you go to a paper     
30:33     
they usually give you a umap which is just basically like this pretty picture     
30:39     
and then sometimes you know we have a lot of information about sequences and their expression but then you know     
30:46     
trying to figure out the relationship like these genes that are similar you     
30:51     
know should that be represented as a network or should that be represented as like some sort of other model that you     
30:58     
know like a model of relative contributions or what exactly is the model that we want to use to     
31:06     
represent this uh this relationship and you know that's still unclear it doesn't     
31:13     
matter you know your kind of latest approach you just have to have something that can maybe predict the phenotype and     
31:20     
that's so you know it's an interesting take but you know it's it's prefaced     
31:26     
with the caveat that you know people have been trying to do this for a while like Hussein said the Human Genome     
31:32     
Project you know the idea was to get uh you know a draft genome and then to use     
31:39     
it for biomedical advances and yeah I mean my T's you know I don't I really     
31:44     
don't mean to sound pessimistic or cynical but like uh it it just it just really fell fell short time and time     
31:50     
again like Collins was uh like Dr Francis Collins was would hype it up and     
31:55     
um people would pour loads and loads of money stuff into it and it turns out biology is very complicated and um you     
32:04     
know I think people really really really misunderestimated like um what things     
32:09     
were capable capable of back then in the so you know yeah yeah I mean the uh the     
32:17     
the the at least like um the human brain product from a comp neural point of view yeah which should fall into s similar     
32:23     
many similar struggles over the over its uh course     
32:29     
like yeah I mean it is it is what it is it's it's best it's best to just you know     
32:35     
like you know just just just like like take steps back from things every now and then and see if you can really     
32:40     
refine your approaches from the ground up before getting back into something so that's what I'll say yeah     
32:45     
right like Morgan maybe had something to say     
32:51     
or biology is complicated yeah yeah completely agree yeah mean bi     
32:58     
biology being complicated is part of that but more so um you know like like     
33:05     
reduction is reductionism itself that um everything you know is is applied physics and applied math or um like     
33:14     
uh I I don't know like like like scale itself scaling things up from a     
33:20     
cognition and from a cognitive and cognitive point of view the ability of humans for us like for me and you to     
33:26     
understand not just the equation that I'm solving right in front of you but what does it mean in practice what does it mean in Practical applications and     
33:32     
scientific research and theory and how well things have to move forward um you know that ability to be for that sort of     
33:39     
flexible thinking I feel like is not taught or instructed nearly as well as it should be even for people with phds     
33:45     
and MDS and all the DS and stuff you know like uh you can be what I'm what I'm saying is what I'm saying is as as     
33:52     
good as you are is doing scientific research publishing papers showing great amazing findings how well those are put into practice even though something is     
33:57     
big as like the human Human Genome product it's a completely different story so yeah yeah so yeah yeah but it     
34:06     
was it was a very important project right um I mean it it it had to be done     
34:13     
and once it was started um um yeah like     
34:20     
like it's the the reason I'm just adding this is that that that not recent but this     
34:29     
year um the the director of um the schizophrenia     
34:36     
research group in oh outside of DC I'm blanking on     
34:42     
particular group but but he had this big he had this big editorial about you know the Human     
34:49     
Genome Project was a failure and oh yeah yeah I mean everyone has very strong opinions on it you know yeah yeah yeah     
34:56     
yeah but you know and it's just like like you know like I I     
35:05     
think I think he was conflating you know a lack of progress in Psychiatry with     
35:12     
with with somehow you know like it the Human Genome Project being at fault     
35:18     
right you and you know I I um yeah yeah I took     
35:25     
some some um yeah yeah you know fail failures are strong were failures are strong were but on some level there was     
35:32     
there was a lot from an epistemic point of view that was more or less taken for granted on how things would scale up how     
35:38     
we could reduce things properly between different contexts um how sort of computational approaches could     
35:44     
generalize like oh we've got so much computing power mathematical power facility why not just shoot all the data     
35:49     
in as much as we can and yeah yeah I mean I I don't think it was     
35:55     
computational like like you know I mean again I think it was really interesting     
36:01     
how Venter like went his own way and what he     
36:07     
did to to make make the project happen faster yeah yeah right and some of those     
36:14     
are still with us today yeah right like like Galaxy projects and and other thing     
36:19     
you know certainly you know he was one of the drivers behind a lot of uh like     
36:25     
Dro development for scientific line but but     
36:30     
um uh yeah if if we hadn't done the project and kind of like H you know had     
36:38     
that all that data out there then maybe people would still be     
36:43     
talking the way that they were talking before the project was done right yeah     
36:48     
yeah and now it's it's like like I think it's a good thing that that you know     
36:54     
sort of we it open the door to this new respect     
37:00     
for the this this these additional layers of complexity that are actually so much greater than just this sequence     
37:08     
of letters yeah right and you know not not even also excuse me for getting political but even um what what people     
37:15     
what what like Obama would be saying too you know like uh some of the claims he'd be making about the promises of     
37:21     
precision Medicine of the human jum project and um how much Hy was able to generate through things like that um but     
37:27     
I always thinking something something from once again my apologies for just bringing politics into this but it is it     
37:33     
was meant to be something he generated appeal and everything around so it's it's like it's like fair to be like well     
37:38     
where where is it where's the change has it happened and um right right but that's you know again     
37:45     
this this this particular editorial brought that up I think I think brought up Clinton oh yeah because of course you     
37:51     
know Human Genome Project was more more his era or okay it it was more like     
37:57     
Clinton and Bush ER it really was and project was more the brain project was more obaz so and and he was just     
38:05     
cripping from from their their from their Grant application you     
38:14     
know so sorry so no problem no problem I mean it's poit it is political like as     
38:21     
as much as Dr Francis Collins wants to argue he's a scientist he's so pure and so Noble his intentions all the time you     
38:27     
know like the dude has a band called The affordable rock and roll act like you can't you can't talk around that and I'm     
38:33     
sorry because I I met I met Collins I Mets I love all these     
38:40     
names what's [Music] ear you tell me you tell me like these     
38:48     
products are not political you tell me they're not political like um at least in some ways but I you know well I I     
38:56     
because of politics and the it seems like all my favorite podcasters are all     
39:02     
former former speech writers for like Obama or Clinton yeah     
39:08     
yeah I I I have I you know I've gotten I've gotten to hear more about how this     
39:15     
off made yeah excuse me I mean um yeah     
39:20     
yeah like but like but but I I say this for a reason with with Obama from his first term to his second term people on     
39:26     
some of be losing trust becoming a bit dissolution and saying you promised so much change like are things happening a     
39:32     
lot of people are still struggling with unemployment back in like like 2000 like 2008 to 2016 there was a recession and     
39:39     
people were like did Obama really follow through on things one thing I'll say and this is where it comes into the context for the human Gom project is um a lot of     
39:45     
times it's like you can't always uh wait for someone to change things for you you have to show the change yourself and     
39:52     
whether or not that applies to the human jom prodject like with Obama saying yes we can yes we can change yes we can things you know he wanted that that     
39:59     
support on from not just people to vote for him and sit on their ass and do nothing but like um you know in terms of     
40:05     
research and scientific change of the Human Genome Project it's we have to be like um we have to be mindful like we     
40:11     
have to be like like we are the ones implementing the change you know we are the ones making those gry it's it's in     
40:17     
our hands so yeah that's what I'll say I think well yeah yeah s go ahead     
40:25     
Bary well one of the things you know we confuse kind of scientific infrastructure with like and this is     
40:31     
more generally like the way science is almost viewed nowadays is that we     
40:37     
confuse building infrastructure with like making progress on scientific     
40:42     
problems and you see this all the time like with like applying computational methods to things     
40:49     
and that it's magically going to help you discover things that you know you     
40:54     
really need to have good theories or you really need to have good uh you know     
40:59     
experimental synthesis or even just good experimental methods to get at so if you build a piece of infrastructure that     
41:07     
brings information to people that they can use where they can draw from to solve their problems that's great but     
41:13     
that doesn't solve the problem you still need to have that other part and we found a lot of like tool building but     
41:19     
then the tools get kind of you know we get a lot of tools and we don't get any insight because people aren't funding     
41:26     
that or we just think that like just building the tool will magically lead to the Insight     
41:34     
so I was also just thinking of this um this paper that um recently I I can't     
41:43     
exactly remember the the conclusion but it it it     
41:49     
um it was analyzing you know the text analysis of Journal articles in the past     
41:57     
20 years or something like that and the the decreasing use of of     
42:07     
um something like the abstracts and and conclusions using stronger terms for you     
42:16     
know certainty and things like that like just just just thinking a bit about     
42:22     
the the rhetoric of of science um the retoric of Science and and you know     
42:30     
again kind of like what are the incentives for that     
42:36     
rhetoric yeah the dangers the dangers of falling     
42:41     
for our own     
42:46     
rhetoric all right yeah let's let's go through the channel more um so this is     
42:52     
uh I guess another LinkedIn link this is uh public version of The Talk slides     
42:58     
that this person gave gmma at UCLA this is uh large language models and     
43:05     
computational biology of primer so this is just kind of talking about yeah go     
43:10     
ahead yeah I was just gonna say I if I if I remember right um This was um there     
43:19     
was there was two things that were happening one was an ipam meeting that     
43:24     
was interesting and one was like um computational genetics     
43:30     
um U like seminar series but like like     
43:35     
they'd obviously had a workshop because they dropped all these videos at the same time okay yeah um but but really     
43:42     
you know like definitely um sometimes when when I'm dropping these links it's     
43:49     
um they're they're kind of um representative of a kind of of a larger     
43:55     
meeting yeah yeah yeah so I don't know why that's just a just an     
44:02     
image oh because I didn't go to the LinkedIn so that's okay wanted yeah     
44:07     
sorry you know yeah like like I've got issues with     
44:13     
X but yeah I didn't want to open up LinkedIn because like yeah anyways     
44:20     
uh yeah so that's that's you know that's what's going on sort of with um you know     
44:26     
these kind of foundation models in computational biology and certainly you know that that is something that we have     
44:33     
the Human Genome Project we just have kind of like the sequences some of the comparative work the tools for the     
44:40     
comparative work but then getting to the representations getting to the actual     
44:46     
comparative work science figuring out like what I don't know the funding     
44:53     
agencies like to say the rules of biology now whatever those are you know those don't come through magic     
44:59     
either we need to kind of do the work to find out what those are so that's all kind of built on top of our tools not     
45:08     
tools is a sort of a replacement thing so I'm just saying that that um     
45:15     
yeah in that link he does actually have links to both his slides it was the     
45:21     
seminar the computational genomics okay seminar and um he's got links to slides     
45:26     
of both from this year and last year oh good so I'm just gonna check um and I'll     
45:33     
try and um post the actual links okay that's fine yeah so these are definitely     
45:40     
like his work in progress which is good because this is a pretty fast moving field like for sure yeah for sure     
45:48     
there's this bioarchive paper uh this     
45:53     
is I wonder why I didn't grab the U oh yeah yeah so this is spatial dynamics     
46:01     
of Mamon brain development and neuroinflammation by multimodal tromix     
46:08     
mapping what is tromix mapping so yeah just it's it's multiomic     
46:14     
but obviously three in this case okay yeah so uh the the abstract reads the     
46:22     
ability to spatially map multiple layers of the omix information uh which is just like where you do one     
46:30     
of these nextg sequencing uh use one of these tools and     
46:35     
you get like whole genome sequencing and expression data using and so there are     
46:41     
all these different methods that people use uh I guess there's RNA protein seek     
46:47     
there's genomic seek you know you can just get all these different types of information and then combining them is     
46:53     
the multiomic aspect um and then definitely going for this     
46:59     
imun immuno chores yeah so you know they can you can     
47:05     
build multiple layers of a biological model so like genes RNA proteins you     
47:12     
have different time points where you can look at brain development     
47:17     
differentiation arealization and alterations and disease um they apply or develop and     
47:25     
apply spatial iomic sequencing so this is     
47:31     
um debit ARP seek spatial ATAC RNA     
47:36     
protein seek and dbit uh ctrp seek     
47:41     
spatial cut and tag RNA protein seek um and then together with Multiplex Domino     
47:48     
fluoresence Imaging which is codex they can map spatial Dynamic Remodeling and     
47:53     
brain development and neuro inflammation so they're getting at this problem using all these different methods then they     
48:00     
have a spatiotemporal triom atlas of the mouse brain since obtained at different     
48:05     
stages from postnatal day P0 to p21 and then this was used to compare     
48:12     
the regions of interest in human developing brains so you you know you build this Atlas in Mouse use these     
48:20     
techniques to build up information about this and then you compare it with human brains uh for similar stages and then     
48:28     
you can find that specifically in the cortical area we discover temporal     
48:34     
persistence and spatial spreading of Chromatin accessibility for the lay defining transcription factors so they     
48:41     
were able to look at like chromatin and uh transcription in Corpus colossum we     
48:48     
observe Dynamic chromatin priming of myin genes across the sub regions     
48:53     
together it suggests a role for layer specific projection neurons to according to ex exogenesis and     
49:00     
myelination we further mapped a brain of a     
49:05     
lysin uh neuroinflammation Mouse model uh which is LPC and observed common     
49:11     
molecular programs and development in neural inflammation microa exhibiting     
49:16     
both conserved and distinct programs for INF inflammation and resolution are     
49:21     
transiently activated not only at the core of the OPC lesion uh but also at distal locations presumably through     
49:29     
neuronal circuitry um this uh work revealed common and differential mechanisms and brain development and     
49:37     
neuroinflammation resulting in a valuable data resource for these things and so this is again it's kind of like     
49:43     
building a tool looking at the data finding some insights and that's you know that's kind     
49:50     
of the way we do things um now you know there's probably a role for is of a lot     
49:57     
of these studies where you can actually get you know because you're you're making some limited insights here you're     
50:03     
collecting a huge amount of data and building this tool and so and then     
50:08     
making the cross species comparison so you know this is really kind of the way     
50:13     
we do things and you can see like you know where kind of the promises we not     
50:20     
quite there yet um if I could just add a little bit about the the pre     
50:28     
um the the previous link of the the this one yeah the the large language model     
50:35     
stuff just to just to say that this um computational genomics summer     
50:41     
Institute um and it has a a website um     
50:47     
sorry which I will um will drop in as a reply here um and     
50:56     
if it has um um     
51:03     
um it is saved all the previous talks um     
51:09     
videos from all the previous years every single year going back to     
51:14     
2016 okay yeah and and just something that's like     
51:20     
Stanford recently did a a foundation model no no sorry     
51:26     
Michigan did a foundation model um summer school and I and and just because     
51:33     
I know we've brought this up U someone was talking about Foundation models and     
51:39     
they were like how many people have read the the Stanford white paper on Foundation models     
51:45     
and and not not enough people raised their head well not enough people raised their hand and he's like he's like okay     
51:51     
well it's a very long document how many people have at least read the     
51:56     
introduction to and that's only 10 pages and and not     
52:02     
enough and he was just like okay if you get anything from my talk read the first 10 pages of     
52:09     
that and it's just just to be um he     
52:14     
thought that they were very clear about what the the definition of a foundation model was I think I think Jesse had     
52:23     
posted something about Frontier models anyway like like you know we've maybe     
52:31     
anyway it would be good and um um yeah yeah just just wanted to just     
52:39     
just wanted to say plus plus this looks like a really great reference in terms of the     
52:45     
um uh uh you know i' I'd love to see this next year and you know gather     
52:52     
gather together a better you know start some kind of mine our calls for     
52:59     
participation links um to mine these kind of like annual events that um that     
53:06     
we should have on that calendar to at least be an attendee or something yeah I     
53:11     
think that would be good I know that like there are so many events and it's like there's so much sort of good     
53:18     
information in them but it's hard to get them out and say oh this is what all these groups are doing yeah yeah for     
53:26     
sure for sure you know and and but that's the thing right that some groups     
53:32     
focus on kind of um trying to you know distill down like like that progress     
53:40     
that year you know from you know get get some representative researchers and get them     
53:47     
to do some some some of their own distillation all yeah yeah yeah yeah so     
53:55     
that's good and then this is the uh computational genomic summer school here     
54:00     
in bioinformatics this is UCLA event so this is the site for that and they're     
54:08     
different um you know different years that they have for it uh so that's good     
54:14     
thank you Morgan for that link um and so then there's this uh link researchers to     
54:20     
investigate genetic roots of autism look for new treatments that's of course     
54:25     
related to computational Psychiatry as well um yeah yeah as well as being um     
54:32     
some some news from the the brain engineers group oh okay that's brain Engineers yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's     
54:39     
that's cool yeah there's this uh link from X which is or Twitter whatever     
54:47     
exciting new inroads into human biology and therapy development human intestinal organoids with an autologous tissue     
54:54     
resident immune compartment so this is the image uh I'm not going to wink     
54:59     
through to the post but this is human organoids with an autologous tissue     
55:04     
resonant IM immune compartment so they have of course this autologous tissue uh     
55:12     
and you so they're creating this human organoid and they're able to do the     
55:18     
stain to show this immune I guess it's a sort of the origins of an immune system     
55:24     
because you have immune cells and you have the epithelial cell surrounding it and so we know we don't     
55:31     
have an immune system yeah but we an immune response of some type going on in the     
55:37     
organ yeah yeah and so that's I mean that's just again you know this sort of     
55:43     
work where we don't know exactly where it's going it looks promising but we don't know I mean obviously it's not an     
55:49     
immune system but it's you know something H yeah yeah and and and of     
55:55     
course the other interesting thing about these these kind of gut um these gut     
56:00     
organoids is that you can also have um     
56:05     
neurons yeah yeah yeah yeah um     
56:14     
that's um then there's this paper profiling cell identity and tissue architecture with single cell and     
56:20     
spatial transcriptomics this is again another spatial and single cell transcriptomic     
56:26     
paper where they're yeah yeah we were we were kind of pushing at celsus um     
56:33     
spatial transer tonics you know and um and again you know and and partly that's     
56:41     
just where where things are in terms of um kind of technique complexity at this     
56:49     
point or you know advancements um but uh but yeah really     
56:55     
really interesting and you know like like probably more papers you know again     
57:01     
like this this absolute flood of of papers and trying to find trying to find     
57:10     
you know um good papers to kind of yeah review all the information that's coming     
57:17     
in right now yeah definitely yeah flood of papers where they're trying to do     
57:23     
stuff like this so this is is a review article yeah so this is where they're     
57:28     
using single SP cell transcriptomics this is this next gen sequencing and this they're trying to do     
57:35     
this in the context of cellular diversity and gene expression Dynamics yeah and healthy and disease tissue so     
57:42     
comparing healthy and disease tissues looking at the different cell types looking at gene expression Dynamics and     
57:49     
we haven't talked about it in a while but in Diva worm we we were talking about this for a while and we I haven't     
57:56     
talked about it but um that there's this um large discrepancy in what constitutes     
58:03     
a cell type and so you know people have estimated say for example all the     
58:09     
different cell types in the human body all the different cell types in the brain and you can of course identify     
58:15     
cells but like if they have a clear type and you know identify those but it's     
58:21     
always a uh an exercise and classification so you know sometimes     
58:26     
cell or cells are incompletely differentiated sometimes they transition between differentiated States sometimes     
58:34     
there's states that are cryptic so you can't necessarily know if it's a     
58:40     
different state or not you know from some other cell that's very similar sometimes you know they're depend     
58:46     
depends on how you define state so it could be largely functional it could be based on the sort of the the morphology     
58:54     
of the cell it could be B based on sort of the class of the cell in other words     
58:59     
if it is like a neuron comes from a neuronal precursor versus a muscle precursor versus like some sort of     
59:06     
epithelial precursor those are all different sort of you know cell types     
59:12     
you know archetypes and then you get different cell types underneath that furthermore you can have cells that     
59:19     
undergo you know apotosis which is programm death or they might be in some     
59:24     
sort of like pre cancer estate or cancer estate and you know other types of     
59:31     
intermediate states of you know disregulation which is basically you     
59:37     
know why cells kind of pop out of their state you know after they're     
59:42     
differentiated so there are a lot of different things going on and you know it's always worth thinking about these     
59:49     
Technologies with respect to that problem which is estimating how many     
59:54     
cell types there are in a isssue or in the body and then what makes a cell type     
1:00:00     
so here they're you know kind of thinking about you know like looking at cellular     
1:00:07     
diversity which means that they're trying to do some sort of census and then they're looking at the gene     
1:00:12     
expression Dynamics and how those change between healthy and disease tissues so in disease tissues we expect there to be     
1:00:19     
more disregulation of gene expression healthy cells or healthy tissues we     
1:00:25     
expect gene expression should be more typical of a cell type you know so that's the idea and then um you know     
1:00:33     
this is of course of review so we with this kind of data we can provide new     
1:00:39     
insights and developmental hierarchies so over plasticity in diverse tissue micro     
1:00:45     
environments and spur you know spur a burst of innovation and computational methods for single cell analysis so     
1:00:52     
again we're back to sort of tool making tool building um but you know there's a lot of stuff     
1:00:59     
going on here uh there's been a lot of progress in data integration identification of subtle     
1:01:06     
cell States so you know I talked about like I talked about trajectory modeling so how does a cell go from a stem cell     
1:01:13     
to some differentiated state or to some other differentiated State deconvolution     
1:01:19     
and spatial in so there are a lot of things here that you know involve sort of the application methods but also     
1:01:27     
basic biology um they're interested in Foundation models and how you fit single     
1:01:33     
salance facial transcriptomic sta into those Foundation ons so this is really     
1:01:39     
kind of a nice review um you not I don't have access right now I don't know why     
1:01:46     
well anyways uh so yeah this is a nice paper nice review article     
1:01:52     
um so then we have some more here we have this I guess this is a thesis     
1:01:58     
towards a general framework of multicellular systems biology with application of cellular motility and     
1:02:04     
phenotype control um and then this uh this is the Simons Foundation newsletter so this is     
1:02:12     
kind of uh I guess this is on some sort of modeling expelling     
1:02:19     
that yeah yeah the um I will say and um     
1:02:24     
I mean they had um they had their general meeting or I forget what     
1:02:31     
they call their meeting but but um I think in BIO Evolution I put um a link     
1:02:39     
um that my friend sent me on the geometry of multicellularity that was a really     
1:02:45     
interesting talk from this theoretical biologist Cambridge um that was really     
1:02:53     
interesting um what's this species     
1:02:58     
um he was he was pointing out that lean hook had had described this species in     
1:03:05     
you know 1700s and you know a multi     
1:03:11     
multicellular um volvox yeah I see yeah yeah yeah yeah     
1:03:18     
yeah yeah exactly exactly and just just some interesting stuff there yeah yeah     
1:03:23     
yeah oh you got it okay yeah it's right there yeah yeah so yeah this looks interesting um yeah really really nice     
1:03:31     
talk really nice talk and and you know he's he's talking about things in kind     
1:03:39     
of the way the glazure and and modeling does permit you know     
1:03:48     
um yeah but but obviously very simple very simple um organisms yeah     
1:03:57     
so that's um let's see go back to the where we were here okay there you go so     
1:04:04     
yeah this is uh Jesse you know he wanted actually to talk about putting together     
1:04:10     
a general project description for brain organoids for some sort of space or     
1:04:15     
project or channel so let's I don't think we ever discussed that properly so I don't know I know we've been     
1:04:21     
preoccupied with the uh act INF uh or Sy     
1:04:26     
so after that passes we can get into that yeah yeah I'd really like to to go     
1:04:34     
down to Santa Cruz and you know meet with brain engineers and see you know     
1:04:40     
again like like I've I've made lots of contacts but really try and put it together in terms of you know um what     
1:04:48     
how much we can build on what they've done and kind of which which directions are would still be you know kind of     
1:04:55     
interesting to move forward um yeah yeah which which directions that kind of like     
1:05:02     
needs more work yeah yeah I think that would be good and you know defining like what     
1:05:08     
those things are you know figuring out how to do them absolutely     
1:05:15     
okay yeah okay yeah Jesse might go to California for business yeah uh so this     
1:05:23     
is a paper a non-invasive quality control organoid cultures using me misof     
1:05:29     
fluidic cstr bioreactors and high content Imaging yeah yeah so this is this is you     
1:05:37     
know again trying to get at a little bit around the the equipment right and just     
1:05:44     
you know like like again if if we're going to do it we want to be able to do it at a at a scale     
1:05:52     
that's an impressive scale and and um you know being able to control the     
1:05:59     
organoids and and keep them keep them um     
1:06:05     
you know fed is is key um and it it also     
1:06:11     
speaks to you know if you can start to use uh alternatives to     
1:06:17     
centrifuges then then you can potentially um uh that this would help     
1:06:23     
in terms of of having let's say I don't want to say     
1:06:29     
different like like different spatial structures could be encouraged     
1:06:38     
yeah is that does that leave me enough room yeah I think     
1:06:44     
so um but you know what I'm saying like like as opposed to just getting kind of     
1:06:49     
spheroids right and yeah that this this will relate to a later kind of link on on     
1:06:57     
matri gel okay yeah yeah so getting yeah getting the shape is important because     
1:07:03     
the shape of course is going to determine how the cells behave basically     
1:07:09     
if you're in a b mean you know again when you when you start to think about     
1:07:15     
you know embryonic development and again like how     
1:07:21     
genetics both controls development and yet doesn't have a spatial plan yeah     
1:07:30     
like or at least you know is is the spatial plan is is still very um is more     
1:07:38     
kind of revealed you know     
1:07:44     
um uh that that so much of it has to do with yeah just spatial context and yeah     
1:07:53     
um yeah like like at that at that moment what what um what are your cell     
1:08:00     
neighbors as a as well as what are the physics forces like um you know     
1:08:07     
compression and sheer you know like mechanical forces on those cells right     
1:08:13     
that that's the really other interesting part of um embryogenesis if you will yeah yeah     
1:08:22     
so yeah in Diva worm we've talked about sort of these models of Tri Junctions     
1:08:27     
and uh four Junctions and five Junctions and this is where the cells are in the sheet and the sheet is the interactions     
1:08:34     
between the cells are such that they form these complex Junctions so the sheet you know where like maybe five     
1:08:40     
cells interact or three cells interact and there's there's been a lot of emerging work on Tri Junctions in     
1:08:46     
particular you have three cells that kind of meet at a point and then they're sharing forces basically that I mean     
1:08:54     
directly usually Shar indect exactly and there's there's some     
1:09:01     
you know this kind of [Music] mechanobiology um as a as a field trying     
1:09:06     
to get at you know to trying to make non invasive measurements of of of     
1:09:14     
physics forces and and to to to to learn more about their their impact you know I     
1:09:21     
mean I've I I've previously seen some of this in terms of     
1:09:27     
um uh it's it's discussed a lot in cortical sheet     
1:09:33     
development like like why we have the convoluted brain yeah and and the um     
1:09:41     
the yeah kind of mechanistic theories behind how that how that occurs and     
1:09:47     
there's some there's some new good work on that but um you know again it's it's     
1:09:54     
a as as well as like like it doesn't have to be that way right in the sense like     
1:10:01     
there are plenty of mammals with smooth brains yeah right and and so yeah it's     
1:10:07     
it's speaking to to something um that needs to be needs to be     
1:10:13     
understood but um yeah really really interesting     
1:10:18     
sorry so then then we have this uh human asems reveal the consequences of CA CNA     
1:10:27     
1G Gene variant and the theoc cortical pathway so this is talking     
1:10:34     
about the Phan cortical pathway and some of these human assembl models up yeah     
1:10:42     
yeah and this was this was a this was a hot kind of     
1:10:47     
um this was a hot Gene to look at and I I think we     
1:10:53     
did I don't we did a lot of we we we you know sorry     
1:11:00     
my Pi had um done genetic analysis of a     
1:11:06     
lot of the the Imaging subjects that he had so we did a lot of these kind of     
1:11:13     
single whe or single Gene studies um and CAC was one of them I I     
1:11:21     
forget what um well they probably say more about um     
1:11:26     
ad here but um yeah this is this was kind of looked at a lot by psychiatric     
1:11:34     
um Nur Imaging people okay yeah     
1:11:39     
yeah okay uh then uh paa posted     
1:11:44     
something on sort of uh these it's an article on these creatures occupy third     
1:11:51     
state be on life and death and then Morgan uh was oh this is on the xenobots     
1:11:57     
so this is a article on the xenobots yeah but like the way the headline is     
1:12:02     
it's kind of yeah that's that's I think that was also my surprise because I was just like what     
1:12:09     
are they talking about just like oh yeah yeah it's not exactly a third     
1:12:15     
state right right it's it's it is it is um what's what's the way the Lev puts it     
1:12:22     
you know or bongard puts it and says like when when not given their     
1:12:30     
[Music] tissue but not given their their natural     
1:12:36     
tissue context or something like that okay like you know but but it emphasizes     
1:12:43     
there the agential material and and this     
1:12:49     
is that that that they could that they have the potential to     
1:12:54     
form new Collective structures yeah right so you're     
1:13:01     
basically taking it out of its tissue context as opposed to this clickbait title yeah and then putting it into a     
1:13:09     
new context where can maybe free itself to to form new structures yeah yeah who wrote The Who's     
1:13:17     
the science alert from I don't know let's take a look um you got me to click     
1:13:23     
so it was successful Peter     
1:13:29     
noed so yeah it's basically about the xenobots and this yeah so this is and     
1:13:36     
just talking about biobots in general but yeah it's like so these uh you know these are just     
1:13:43     
basically organoids and having this sort of reflection on what they are they're     
1:13:48     
not sort of the typical um developmental system because we don't have the tissue     
1:13:54     
Conta but we do have we can take it out of that context and do interesting things with it     
1:14:01     
so so so in their defense um     
1:14:07     
the the person writing this article typically looks at we are sence     
1:14:15     
we are researchers who investigate what happens within organisms after they die     
1:14:20     
which which is kind of interesting yeah yeah for for proper science reasons not     
1:14:27     
just yeah um uh but yeah still not still nothing     
1:14:34     
to do with Zen yeah uh this is an a workshop on data     
1:14:41     
driven Discovery at the Allen Institute right is yeah they were they     
1:14:46     
were just pushing one of their meetings yeah Ai and modeling and biology yeah this is think we talked     
1:14:55     
about this paper before maybe in um in maybe in Deva and that is how to build     
1:15:03     
an artificial cell or how toell artificial Zuckerberg yeah I mean again     
1:15:09     
they were kind of pushing their own pushing their own agenda here yeah     
1:15:16     
yeah how to build the virtual cell with artificial intelligence priorities and opportunities we talked about this in a     
1:15:22     
diva meeting I kind of went through some of the vision that they had and it's very similar to what we've been talking     
1:15:28     
about with Foundation models and using the standard you know uh approaches of     
1:15:35     
the day in machine learning to approach uh you know trying to Model A     
1:15:41     
Cell so I mean you know this is not yeah and and you know and sort of     
1:15:48     
looping back to the Human Genome Project kind of discussion you know we need like like     
1:15:57     
I guess you know one of the reasons that I post these is that you know Allen Institute and Chan Zuckerberg     
1:16:05     
are you know they needed to reach a certain size     
1:16:11     
or you know have a certain funding to be able to do these kinds of things right     
1:16:17     
yeah you know it it's um um you know which which sort of speaks about you     
1:16:25     
know it's kind of interesting again thinking back to the Human Genome Project and kind of like what it took for Venter to go     
1:16:34     
alone you know which is to say he didn't do it without a lot of resources right     
1:16:40     
right right um um and you know and yet at the same time     
1:16:48     
this is sort of Beyond any single Pi certainly any kind of ECR right right     
1:16:56     
that that this is this is very difficult to to put together um and you know it     
1:17:04     
speaks to kind of like the difficulty in getting kind of like the software Engineers you would need the getting     
1:17:11     
kind of the the research staff you would need and and having a kind of really you     
1:17:17     
know kind of like Center long um funding Horizon and you know and certainly     
1:17:25     
funding stability um to be able to get anything like that done right you know um and     
1:17:35     
um as well sorry and just just to follow up on your post of that Professor Dave     
1:17:41     
video which I thought oh yeah was was really good but you know     
1:17:46     
like you know probably is true in science in a lot of you know in a lot of     
1:17:53     
science right which is that like you know because you need you need this these these big     
1:18:01     
science projects that of course there's going to be people complaining about this or that is missed something like     
1:18:08     
that because there's a kind of um there there     
1:18:15     
is yeah anyway there there there's there's some scarcity and and then there's arguments about where how that     
1:18:22     
scarcity is used yeah defin only an agenda setting like you know you say this is what we need to do but of course     
1:18:29     
I don't know if AI models because you know when we think about modeling the cell we need to have metabolic models     
1:18:36     
Network models A diversity of models that really kind of fit what we're dealing with and then there's this     
1:18:42     
approach where you say well we can just plug it into Ai and find interesting things which isn't necessarily going to     
1:18:49     
help you because the reason we use those kind of models that we use in like not a     
1:18:55     
foundation model context is because they sort of approximate what's going on biologically so yeah yeah yeah and as as     
1:19:05     
one of the things that came out of that Foundation models Michigan series was     
1:19:10     
just that like you know H again how much of our current AI hype is driven by     
1:19:18     
basically gpus and all the text on the internet yeah right like like you know     
1:19:25     
it it it's cool it's but like like it doesn't necessarily generalize right so     
1:19:33     
yeah let's let's move on I want to kind of wrap this up I mean we've been looking at a lot of the papers but so we     
1:19:39     
have this uh paper multicellular artificial neural network type architectures demonstrate computational     
1:19:46     
problem solving and we can come back to that later in the meeting which I have it in the folder so we might talk about     
1:19:52     
that and it's basically where they're getting these uh I guess these bacterial cells to do computations and they're     
1:19:59     
getting them to make these binary decisions basically giving them a question and and it what they do is they     
1:20:05     
have like in bacterial cells you know they'll Express something from a genetic     
1:20:10     
circuit and then they'll take that and use it as the computation so you can do     
1:20:15     
these in bacterial cells because the bacterial genome is relatively simple you can uh use like a a gal for uh uas     
1:20:24     
system to get uh your bacteria to express certain things and you can then     
1:20:30     
drive it with like a stimulus so you can actually do computation much easier and     
1:20:36     
say like a a bacterial uh Colony than you can and say like a eukariotic organism but what they     
1:20:44     
do here is is interesting and maybe we'll come back to this later uh then we have this uh sergu     
1:20:52     
pasca on Assemble this is yeah if you want to move down and he he has he has like     
1:21:02     
three papers but um I think the most the bottom one is got is four is four asid     
1:21:11     
okay yes this is kind of I don't know why it's dark like this but uh the title     
1:21:17     
is aoid model to study Loop circuits of the human nervous system this is a     
1:21:22     
bioarchive pap so yeah this is I don't know if there's a link to the oh sorry     
1:21:29     
let me let me see if I can um uh oh yeah here's here I'll give you     
1:21:35     
a preprint a a bio archive okay yeah that's good so this is the one of the     
1:21:40     
models he has here the neural organoids neural assembl loids and a disease model so the neural organoids are basically     
1:21:48     
these uh different sort of organoids of a tissue type so with muscle organoids L     
1:21:55     
blastoma organoids strial organoids theic organoids basically different     
1:22:00     
parts of the brain or tissues in the brain that are uh you know you can build an organoid which is just this ball and     
1:22:07     
then the assembl oid is where you put those organoids together and you assemble them into some so uh some     
1:22:13     
structure so the forbrain or assembl oid is subp Palo organoid and cortical     
1:22:19     
organoid and you're putting together two tissues getting them to functional integrate uh and then you have so you     
1:22:26     
have migration asids and projection asids in the neuro asmid basically you     
1:22:32     
know you have things that can you know where cells can migrate between the two tissue uh organoid types or they can     
1:22:41     
project their projections into each other so that's what we have in the costal symbl oids the cortical spinal     
1:22:49     
muscle assembl so we're building Pathways now from these tissues and then     
1:22:54     
you have these disease models so you can take the assembl oids and look at deficits in migration deficits in     
1:23:01     
connectivity which come from the inability to project into the proper targets so you get these you can study     
1:23:08     
these different uh you know Pathways but also disease models where those pathways     
1:23:14     
are disrupted that's really cool that's a nice uh way of kind of thinking about     
1:23:19     
that um and then okay then Morgan posted this paper um yeah yeah and that's just     
1:23:28     
the that's the actual study yeah or that's the the okay so this study yeah     
1:23:34     
is sort of the what they're doing in that figure so yeah and they're building     
1:23:39     
these recursive Loop circuits yeah yeah yeah and this this I mean I believe     
1:23:45     
that's the most or you know the the largest number um um I'm trying to think     
1:23:52     
matal and Lancaster's um advisor in [Music]     
1:23:58     
Vienna um noish okay sorry I'm getting old uh uh noish has a     
1:24:07     
three organoid assembl okay um I think it's a dopamine     
1:24:15     
focused um so it has like a basil ganglia     
1:24:21     
um component cortical uh I forget now but um anyway so this     
1:24:28     
this is cool in terms of what what they're doing and and again serg is um     
1:24:34     
the um the the head of the brain Organo     
1:24:39     
genesis. org group that does the the really cool Workshop that I'd really     
1:24:45     
like to to participate in in terms of covering covering their their protocols     
1:24:52     
yeah all right yeah that's good so that's uh our Channel our brain organoid Channel     
1:24:59     
we've caught up on it so thank you Morgan for doing a lot of the posting there and getting us those     
1:25:05     
resources and I hope that we can follow up on a lot of this um so this all right     
1:25:10     
so we have some posts in the uh chat here uh yeah so there just kind     
1:25:18     
of um yeah yeah     
1:25:25     
[Music] so uh I don't know if Jesse wanted to     
1:25:30     
give any update or I don't think you had a chance to hey um yeah I was also gonna     
1:25:37     
I was also when you were talking about like the how much success is based off     
1:25:44     
of like gpus and what's what available internet data and stuff like that I was     
1:25:49     
trying to find a good version of the like hack to plant uh that Love     
1:25:55     
sometimes just in the sense of like I think that's     
1:26:00     
um I think that's a really great question in in many ways and and I I I     
1:26:06     
did appreciate the discussion earlier on the Human Genome Project and same was here and sort of the different points     
1:26:13     
that everybody brought up about that um as far as     
1:26:18     
updates go um a lot of work behind the scenes this week     
1:26:25     
[Music] uh um congratulations to Jen um she's     
1:26:35     
made it to the first round of a certain um Fellowship that might lead to     
1:26:40     
projects for like mental health related stuff um it's a little bit more well it     
1:26:46     
depends depending on how things go it could lead to a little more research project um than than other things but     
1:26:55     
but it's sort of to be determined on what will happen there but um it's     
1:27:01     
good to see um you know one of one of the one of the things I'm really curious about     
1:27:06     
right now and and finding myself in in in like going into is sort of these grants fellowships opportunities and I'm     
1:27:14     
not really able I know I mentioned in like one of the admin channels about like hey let's start going over these     
1:27:21     
you know what's coming up what can we Target and what's available um I'm not really able to in the past I     
1:27:27     
would lead through like a big chart about that and I can't do that right now but I am finding myself increasingly in     
1:27:33     
that space and I really think um even me know most of them are just are much     
1:27:38     
smaller things you know or or or more like individual based and you know     
1:27:44     
here's how you can find um this and that but but but to     
1:27:49     
that end um excuse me     
1:27:55     
I oh I never posted this in in slack it was it was always said this a draft I'm     
1:28:01     
actually also looking into     
1:28:07     
automating a little bit of web scraping some stuff around these topics because I know I know we have such Niche things     
1:28:13     
that it's sort of an interesting game to try to find what's happening and where and who can apply to it and then     
1:28:19     
specifically for I would say in sort of a Joe Pro um     
1:28:25     
lens um and it fits this laab too even more for Joe proo like things that are     
1:28:32     
like very intentionally open to uh let's I'll use the p word of     
1:28:38     
progressive and I don't necessarily mean everything that it means about that but like Progressive in a people open to     
1:28:45     
doing science in new ways or open source ways or in different ways and finding what's available in those spaces for     
1:28:51     
opportunities is um interesting like there's actually quite a bit it's     
1:28:58     
just especially for things that are like there's a bunch of new organizations popping up all the     
1:29:04     
time that are trying to fund stuff differently it's just they're new and     
1:29:10     
it's sort of on the cusp anyways so I for anyone interested in that please     
1:29:16     
reach out to me and slack or who you're saying this wherever you you you know um     
1:29:22     
wherever you know me from is I I'm very interested     
1:29:29     
in I feel it's like like Old School uh not quite gangster but sort of old     
1:29:35     
school like fixer role of like us getting people attached to Opportunities and     
1:29:41     
then helping them develop projects like that's I I enjoy it but it also seems to be     
1:29:47     
this intermediary role that I'm finding myself in a lot of a lot of ways lately     
1:29:54     
so for people who have advice about that or who are looking for stuff or who know     
1:29:59     
where to find stuff let me know it's it's been interesting being here in Boston in that sense and I'm I'm not     
1:30:05     
really spent a lot of time in the Bay Area out out west because I know those is different there's different sort of     
1:30:11     
geographic things going on there and Natures for all that stuff but it's just been an interesting     
1:30:17     
um I don't know couple months that that's ramped up into completely by     
1:30:23     
chance finding an opportunity that I think Jenna is a really great shot at which would help her and for like in     
1:30:29     
turn do some things for the lab but also like it's sort of like getting your first research funded sort of research     
1:30:37     
project opportunity that could further career in in you know doing     
1:30:43     
more um research or work or projects or initiatives kind of thing and that's     
1:30:48     
cool um so congrats to Jennifer that I've applied to a few things myself um I     
1:30:57     
one of them is kind of simple one of them is more     
1:31:03     
involved um we'll see also I applied to the foresight Institute Fellowship a while     
1:31:09     
ago and I'm assuming I didn't get it because there's been no communic I haven't seen anything about it maybe I'm     
1:31:16     
missing it um or maybe I'm just not cool enough or or Forward Thinking enough     
1:31:21     
like I I don't I don't know what that is I had an interview about that like a month ago and I think it's I think I     
1:31:28     
struck out that's fine if I did um I I     
1:31:34     
think I know like scientists or people in maybe graduate programs kind of get     
1:31:41     
PhD students get this eventual push like oh here's how you pursue fighting opportunities but for people that aren't     
1:31:47     
in that or who aren't doing that but still want to do research um it's definitely some like a     
1:31:53     
approach and skill set and all that stuff so um that's a very     
1:31:59     
broad higher level research coordinator is update outside of that     
1:32:06     
um there's there's a number of things in terms of like basically applied data science that I'm looking into for     
1:32:13     
various projects in the lab um also potentially combining with I     
1:32:19     
guess sort of meta science approaches which meta science is sort     
1:32:25     
of my current word for you     
1:32:30     
know uh sort of Quantified is takes on philosophy his perod science the     
1:32:36     
metascience alliance and and I I've been trying to get a meeting with iore     
1:32:42     
the um I think something for open source research or open research uh group um I     
1:32:50     
did I did a few things particularly some weeks ago with with with them at I didn't do I I I attended an event that's     
1:32:58     
what I should say um so I'm curious to do more in that space as well     
1:33:04     
and yeah we we also had a we finished the robins on bston memory paper this     
1:33:11     
week which was nice in in the in our other meetings um I appreciate that in     
1:33:18     
special too that's that's kind of my updates I suppose yeah thanks for the up so yeah     
1:33:25     
get you know you talked about your applied data science and meta science interest so that's the thing I want to     
1:33:30     
get to next so you posted an interesting thing in the slack this week and I wanted to go over it so this is the U     
1:33:37     
UCSD map of Science and this was a I guess a paper by Katie bner who does a     
1:33:44     
lot of visualization and at all and they did     
1:33:50     
this uh I guess like 12 years ago but yeah so yeah 2012 and so this is the global maps of     
1:33:58     
science that can be used as a reference system to chart career trajectories the location of emerging     
1:34:04     
research FR tiers or the expertise profiles of institutes or nations and     
1:34:09     
then you know kind of showing this UCSD map of Science and classification system     
1:34:16     
so this is based on using 7.2 million papers and the references from     
1:34:22     
scopus uh from the web of science arts and Humanity citation     
1:34:28     
indices and more and so this is where they you know built this Corpus and they     
1:34:35     
kept adding to it and so to our knowledge it's the first time that a wide Le map of science was updated a     
1:34:42     
comparison of the original five-year new 10-year maps and classification system show one an increase in the total number     
1:34:49     
of journals that can be mapped by 9,49 journals so there more journals um a     
1:34:57     
simplification of the map by assigning all but five highly interdisciplinary journals to exactly one discipline and     
1:35:04     
then a more even distribution of journals over 554 subdisciplines and 13     
1:35:09     
disciplines when calculating the coefficient of variation and then a better reflection of Journal clusters     
1:35:16     
when compared with paper level citation data so this is pretty hardcore     
1:35:22     
um uh sence visualization of like basically different fields and how those     
1:35:30     
things uh kind of fall out so papers are being published in different fields     
1:35:35     
sometimes they're interdisciplinary but they fit into a certain set of fields and then you can see that you know     
1:35:41     
different fields are connected to one another through you know uh co- sitations and and you know Publications     
1:35:49     
so this is the map here this is a visualization of the UCSD map     
1:35:54     
uh on the left there's this two-dimensional mer Mercator Projection     
1:36:00     
and then uh with 3D spherical inserts at the top and then this 1D circular map on     
1:36:06     
the right so basically the way they do this is they basically it's a network     
1:36:12     
and they have to project it in some way so you know it's on this sphere on this     
1:36:17     
circle and they've taken this network and they've flattened it out into this     
1:36:23     
two-dimensional view here this this network right here where you start with     
1:36:30     
kind of it's it's sort of um pidal so you know the left side connects to the     
1:36:35     
right side and the right side connects to the left side that's how you're supposed to interpret that but it's so     
1:36:42     
it's like a a map of the world um you have math and physics on this side Cs     
1:36:49     
and electrical engineering down here which is pretty close to the math and physics physics     
1:36:54     
cluster you have chemical engineering mechanical engineering civil engineering     
1:37:00     
here you have earth science is connecting down here and chemistry connecting up here then moving out     
1:37:06     
further you have biology biotechnology infectious disease medicine those are all expected to be     
1:37:13     
kind of in a group together connected to earth science in the case of biology and     
1:37:19     
chemistry in the case of biotechnology then you have brain research which connects to Health     
1:37:25     
Professions and Medical Specialties but also the social sciences and then the     
1:37:30     
social science is connected math and physics on this side and then the humanities are out here kind of     
1:37:37     
connected to social science so it's not surprising I mean we kind of know if we     
1:37:42     
just read the literature and how things are referenced I mean from our discussion today we had a very you know     
1:37:50     
sort of math and physics SL biology chemist heavy discussion with some brain     
1:37:56     
research and Medicine we're all kind of connected in different ways but also you     
1:38:01     
know when we have our discussions about like AI ethics it's kind of more social     
1:38:07     
science oriented maybe someb brain research but more Humanities so you know     
1:38:12     
that and we know kind of intuitively that's the case but this kind of shows the network     
1:38:18     
topology so you know what are the insights we can learn from this well I mean we can learn kind of how different     
1:38:24     
Publications are connected we know what Fields look like uh but you know the     
1:38:30     
Publications are really the thing that Define the fields more than kind of University departments so University     
1:38:36     
departments say House people under a name but a lot of times people do different types of research and it     
1:38:42     
connects to different things and so this is a way to identify you know not only     
1:38:47     
sort of the boundaries of a field or what people are doing in a field how they're connecting with other areas     
1:38:54     
but also kind of the opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration and that's not to say you     
1:39:00     
couldn't have an earth science's Humanity's collaboration it's just not shown in     
1:39:05     
this map just in the way it's so that's okay so this is     
1:39:10     
interesting and then on the right side we have the circular map that kind of shows the domains as they're sort of     
1:39:16     
aligned with one another so they're adjacencies uh between different fields     
1:39:22     
and you know that's that's what that's showing and then this is their Cal which is their interface so you can actually     
1:39:29     
look at specific papers or specific groups of papers in these I guess     
1:39:35     
competencies as each circle represents a competency of the University of California at San Diego so they're using     
1:39:42     
a specific um university and they're looking at these     
1:39:47     
competencies at the University and they're looking at the papers kind of fit into that competency which and then     
1:39:54     
their subject areas so each of these competencies have contributional you     
1:39:59     
know the subject areas contribute to this through papers and you can see that breakdown on these circles with these     
1:40:07     
lines there different colors which correspond to the subject areas this is a really interesting     
1:40:13     
interface um and then this is a graph here where they actually have a     
1:40:20     
fractional Journal count for each type of Journal so they kind of show this and     
1:40:25     
then they show this um this is Indiana University's Vivo which is like a     
1:40:32     
research um platform and you can see like you know faculty sign up for Vivo     
1:40:39     
um and you know certain universities use the system and it just shows you kind of     
1:40:47     
the different activity in different areas by the number of Publications so     
1:40:52     
it's really interesting um I don't know if this is like this is good for like     
1:40:58     
identifying different fields and how paper spit into the fields unfortunately     
1:41:03     
it could be used as sort of like a an evaluation metric which has a lot of     
1:41:09     
negative implications some positive but mostly negative far as I can tell but I     
1:41:14     
mean you know there this is this is nice work um so yeah thank you for posting     
1:41:20     
that Jesse yeah um it was quite interesting also     
1:41:25     
interesting that it's my universary that did that um I haven't I'm curious to     
1:41:31     
look into it a bit more and as I said there's sort of this     
1:41:41     
interesting space between meta science complexity data science and and this     
1:41:47     
kind of stuff that I'm exploring and I I I really wonder if there's other     
1:41:53     
I'm I'm curious what modern work in in that space is doing or what if the researchers have done other     
1:41:59     
things I really haven't followed up on it but we'll see we will look into     
1:42:08     
that yeah it' be interesting I mean I I don't know if like I mean I'm sure they've updated their um database and     
1:42:17     
their methodology a little bit but so I think I'll talk about this uh this set     
1:42:22     
of work this is uh a collection of papers mapping reward functions to the brain so this is a a post on Blue Sky by     
1:42:31     
Blake Richards is you know an AI person neuro AI person that um and so this I     
1:42:39     
think one of the most important challenges of neuro AI in the coming years will be mapping to different     
1:42:44     
neurom modulatory systems mapping the different neurom modulatory systems onto different     
1:42:50     
internal word functions and so the papers like this are kind of the groundwork we need for that then there's     
1:42:56     
this length of paper which I will then show you next uh this paper is dopamine     
1:43:02     
and neuro epinephrine differentially mediate the exploration exploitation     
1:43:08     
tradeoff so this is uh we know we talked a couple weeks ago about uh the research     
1:43:16     
agenda for neuro aai the different interesting questions in the field and you know kind of what the good you know     
1:43:24     
kind of sub subdisciplines are or sub Specialties are so this is maybe kind of     
1:43:32     
one take on this so it's basically if you're looking at neurom modulatory     
1:43:37     
systems can you map those at different internal reward functions and if you can do that then you can simulate maybe some     
1:43:44     
neurom modulatory system build a simulation group and then replicate these reward functions and then fit that     
1:43:50     
into a model of you know like a neural network model and then have a better     
1:43:57     
sense of like how reard uh you know sort of informs     
1:44:02     
Behavior so that's kind of where this is going and we talked about uh dopamine a     
1:44:09     
while back and how you know there's this sort of idea that dopamine is a reward     
1:44:16     
molecule and you know it's well it's true that it's a reward molecule a lot     
1:44:21     
of the neuromodulatory functions of dopamine less clear so you know it's not     
1:44:27     
like a straightforward you get more dopamine you get more reward and that's     
1:44:32     
kind of like you know um that explains everything there it's a little bit more     
1:44:38     
subtle than that so this is a nice um kind of insight and this is the paper     
1:44:44     
this is I guess Blake Richard's paper so that's why he was advertising but um and     
1:44:50     
so this paper is called brain like learning with exponentiated gradients so     
1:44:57     
um okay so let's go into the abstract um the abstract reads computational     
1:45:02     
Neuroscience relies on gradient descent for training in artificial neuron Network models of the brain the     
1:45:09     
advantage of gradient descent is that it's effective at learning difficult tasks however it produces Anns that are     
1:45:17     
phenomenological fit to biology making them less relevant as models of the     
1:45:23     
so basically what happens is that gradient descent is used as sort of a     
1:45:28     
heuristic for learning difficult tasks if you climb this gradient or descend the gradient it's basically a way to     
1:45:35     
discover like an optimal solution and then that's the idea of your neural     
1:45:41     
network is it's trying to climb these gradients or descend these gradients and find the right you know find the optimal     
1:45:47     
solution the global U minimum or maximum for that matter so I mean that's the     
1:45:53     
logic behind things like reinforcement learning or also genetic algorithms and     
1:46:00     
you use these biological metaphors to sort of you know climb that gradient or descend that gradient in in in a way     
1:46:07     
that's differentiable but of course biology doesn't necessarily do that we don't     
1:46:12     
have like gradients in the brain we don't store gradients in our brains as representations we store maybe you know     
1:46:21     
uh we have we can optimize our neuronal networks we can have you know if we're     
1:46:26     
dealing with an organoid we can optimize those neuronal networks there's a lot of signaling that goes on that might go in     
1:46:32     
a specific Direction but we can't necessar you know there's no there's no     
1:46:38     
gradient maybe there's an energy gradient that is you know something that     
1:46:43     
the brain is constrained by like you know it can't violate the laws of     
1:46:49     
physics but to say that there's a gradient that that network is     
1:46:55     
conscientiously uh Consulting as it learns is not the case so it's a poor     
1:47:01     
phenomenological fit so uh specifically it violates Dale's law by allowing     
1:47:07     
synapsis to change from excitatory to inhibitory and leads the synaptic weights that are non log normally     
1:47:14     
distributed contradicting experimental data so in using Radiance we often you     
1:47:21     
know C have to bend the rules of biology and uh you know and of get the     
1:47:29     
answer that we're because in an an approximation of learning it's fine but if you're trying to map this to the     
1:47:35     
brain it's not fine here starting from first principles     
1:47:40     
of optimization Theory we present an alternative learning algorithm exponentiated gradient EG that respects     
1:47:48     
Dale's law and produces log normal weights without losing the power of learning with gradi     
1:47:53     
so we can get these gradi or get gradient like things and get our system     
1:47:59     
get conformative gradient like things without um you know kind of putting this     
1:48:06     
artificial model onto the de onto the system we also show them biologically     
1:48:12     
relevant settings EG outperforms GD so this is where you know I guess biologically relevant is you know where     
1:48:20     
you have actual biological networks that are learning things including learning     
1:48:25     
from sparsely relevant signals and dealing with synaptic pruning so this is where you're getting changes in the     
1:48:31     
connectivity or you're getting sparse signals to learn from and you have to kind of generalize things and and make     
1:48:39     
um you know judgments about being given very little prior     
1:48:44     
information altogether our results show that EG is a superior learning algorithm for modeling the brain with the NN this     
1:48:52     
say is where you know we want to model the brain not necessarily model data and     
1:48:58     
so we have to kind of think a little bit differently about this so you know people have been aside from like machine     
1:49:06     
learning people have been applying gradient descent to computational Neuroscience studies and here are some     
1:49:12     
citations here radiant descent is leveraged in these studies because it's very effective for training artificial     
1:49:18     
neural networks even though it is not considered biologically plausible     
1:49:24     
moreover it is clear that radiant descent is phenomenologically different from the learning algorithms of the     
1:49:29     
brain so first radiant Des descent prescribed synaptic changes that violate     
1:49:35     
bailes law or changes from synaptic inhibition to excitation so it's just changing the sort of the sign of that U     
1:49:43     
which is important if you're you're talking about you know uh learning and knowing how that's regulated right     
1:49:51     
second GD does not produce synaptic weights that are log normal this is just a distribution of synaptic     
1:49:58     
weights and this is something that has an effect on how they you know perform     
1:50:04     
especially in response to with response to real time     
1:50:09     
behaviors um and this has been observed L normal distribution of synaptic     
1:50:14     
weights has been observed across species and marine regions uh that means that the activity     
1:50:21     
is not like distributed across the network widely it's distributed in like maybe certain     
1:50:28     
places in the network um even if we set aside concerns about     
1:50:35     
biological plausibility of radiant descent these phenomenological differences motivate the search for an     
1:50:41     
alternative more brain-like learning out or training models of neural     
1:50:48     
circuits um however from an alternative algorithm to be better than G for computational Neuroscience it should     
1:50:55     
be no less powerful at learning than GD ideally better at learning a biological relevant     
1:51:02     
situations so this is uh you know basically reason we use gradient descent in the first place to say learn     
1:51:09     
difficult tests is because it is fundamentally normative so it provides the greatest Improvement in a measure of     
1:51:16     
Behavioral performance with the smallest changes of the synapsis is possible so we don't want to change the synapses a     
1:51:22     
lot we just want to change them in a way that's you know we can understand but     
1:51:28     
also in a way that doesn't disrupt other behaviors which is you know not necessarily the way biology does this uh     
1:51:35     
biology can change synaptic weights quite a bit but then yet end up with behavior of performance that is you know     
1:51:43     
you know maybe adaptive or maybe you can have different behaviors and words or     
1:51:48     
things like that so um what does it mean but what does mean to measure synaptic     
1:51:54     
weight change here we reanalyze this core theoretical assumption and show that radiant descent is not align with     
1:52:01     
Biology so in measuring synaptic weight change and understanding how this is occurring they find that gradient     
1:52:09     
descent does not align with Biology partially because it is a because is based on a measure of     
1:52:15     
synaptic change that is agnostic to changes between inhibition and     
1:52:20     
excitation using this in sight we explored a related but different learning algorithm exponentiated     
1:52:27     
gradient and this is uh from this publication Kent in warmouth in     
1:52:32     
1997 like GD exponential exponentiated gradient is also derived from normative     
1:52:38     
first principles and leverages gradient signals for learning but is based on a measure of synaptic change that as well     
1:52:46     
uh this works as well for uh works as well as gradient descent for     
1:52:53     
learning which rules out the common concern that brain-like algorithms do not scale the hard     
1:52:59     
tasks okay so this is let's see if I can find some figures here     
1:53:05     
um this is just showing you know these differences between the two types of you     
1:53:11     
know gradient descent and exponentiated gradients and how we get the synaptic     
1:53:18     
distance penalty between time points uh um we also have some of these     
1:53:24     
task responses and the training response and so we can Bas exponentiated     
1:53:32     
gradients solve the mod mod Cog Suite of tasks as well as gradient descent but     
1:53:37     
with more biological weight Solutions that's figure     
1:53:43     
one figure two is exponentiated gradient finds weights that are easier to prune     
1:53:48     
and easier to retrain after prune radi of descent so in learning you often     
1:53:54     
prune synapses and you grow new synapses and this is to reconfigure the network     
1:54:02     
not through necessarily weights but like just printing the connections and establishing other connections and so     
1:54:09     
exponentiated gradients allow you to do this more easily and this also has implications for     
1:54:16     
developmental um AI as well because in development we get a lot of uh weight     
1:54:22     
pruning or synaptic pruning that's a key feature of sort of the development of things like visual     
1:54:29     
system uh figure three exponentiated gradients outperform gradient descent     
1:54:34     
when relevant inputs are sparse so this is where we have the spars     
1:54:39     
inputs um and we get this better performance uh and     
1:54:45     
then in figure four continuous control with noise is better than exponentiated     
1:54:51     
radient so this is where you get this uh I guess this is continuous control of     
1:54:58     
noise um and you're using exponentially a gradient and it's better I guess than     
1:55:05     
using gradient descent so continuous controlled noises where you basically have these naturalistic behaviors like     
1:55:12     
moving towards a Target or uh you know getting feedback from the arm versus and     
1:55:18     
and filtering out the noise feedback that you might get or the noise feedback and so this is the I guess a     
1:55:25     
robot arm where you're measuring the starting point and then moving towards the target this is the recurrent neural     
1:55:32     
network that's sending muscle commands out so this this arm is kind of moving towards a Target and it's sending the     
1:55:38     
muscle command so it knows how much time you know how much control it needs to     
1:55:44     
how much modu modulatory control it needs to reach the target successfully     
1:55:49     
and then of course you have to train your recurrent neural networks so before training it's pretty sloppy after     
1:55:55     
training it's pretty precise you get arm feedback and noise feedback so you get the feedback from the arm and it has to     
1:56:02     
be filtered out from noise which is where you get like inertia and things like that and so it's able to sort of     
1:56:10     
converge on you know some sort of Target solution and then this is where you look     
1:56:16     
at the paths that this controller takes to the different targets from origin     
1:56:22     
need see that and this is a classic kind of plot that they use in motor learning where they kind of look at the path that     
1:56:28     
the and the end effector is taken to the Target and you can see that in you know     
1:56:35     
in this is exponentiated gradients this is gradient descent so gradient descent there's a lot more variability a lot     
1:56:42     
more noise included in the movement so this is almost like you know someone with a movement disorder trying to move     
1:56:48     
to a Target um and then this is exponentially gradient which is a lot smoother and there's only some variation     
1:56:55     
at the Target location where it's trying to find the exact target and so the the     
1:57:01     
paths however are smoother and so you can see this for 3,000 and 6,000     
1:57:08     
Ms um all right so I think that's um you know some nice work on yeah there you go     
1:57:13     
Morgan sorry I did I had to step away from um     
1:57:19     
no really interesting yeah you know I mean a great example of of     
1:57:26     
um like you said our like he said in his Pap you know     
1:57:34     
um not trying to do data analysis trying to create a brain right or you know like     
1:57:43     
like a an artificial brain um     
1:57:48     
so yeah really really interesting in how kind of like a simple property created     
1:57:56     
or you know a simple a somewhat simple     
1:58:03     
difference gives you all these you know brain     
1:58:11     
reproducing features or behaviors um     
1:58:16     
um that uh yeah like great great example     
1:58:22     
of neuro AI yeah you know whatever whatever we want to call it brain brain     
1:58:27     
AI yeah um yeah yeah so uh very cool and     
1:58:34     
um not not surprising I'm I'm pretty sure I I wouldn't be surprised if he was     
1:58:41     
one of the the Montreal speakers yeah I think he's in Montreal yeah at the Maine yeah yeah and     
1:58:50     
um um just wanted to add     
1:58:55     
um shoot um I I was just gonna say what were the     
1:59:03     
meetings this week that were um of of     
1:59:10     
note um I'm blanking I I I had one like 20     
1:59:16     
minutes ago okay and um uh     
1:59:23     
yeah just just again very happy uh my daughter was complaining about my my     
1:59:30     
YouTube use and and I was pointing out to her that um I'm not exactly on Tik     
1:59:37     
Tok uh I I like the fact that YouTube gives me access to the world's Scholars     
1:59:43     
yeah and the talks that they are giving um and anyway some some great     
1:59:50     
meetings that were were all you know that they posted all their videos online     
1:59:58     
and um um I will check but     
2:00:04     
um but I usually drop them in the slack yeah yeah we can revisit those yeah yeah     
2:00:11     
yeah there was something oh I mean um I mean San Institute dropped a bunch of     
2:00:18     
videos but I don't know if they were they were super recent but but I dropped one     
2:00:23     
um Frontier map just because it it seemed like it was kind of patent related it it reminded me of     
2:00:31     
um the the the old paper from Mark BAU on patents and was it like Norman     
2:00:38     
package or something like that yeah yeah yeah anyway yeah at     
2:00:46     
that oh well it's yeah and a great talk um I     
2:00:52     
forget what he called it it was a really interesting San FS to talk about like     
2:00:59     
are we on the way to Cincinnati okay which is which is a funny talk title     
2:01:07     
um anyway social psychologist uh you know experimental psychologist um but uh     
2:01:15     
uh also a comedian standup comedian and     
2:01:22     
and so they when they were introducing him they said something like um you know     
2:01:28     
he's this professor and that you know got his degree here um he is also on     
2:01:35     
IMDb at a with a movie that has um you know that     
2:01:42     
has achieved three on the Rotten Tomato     
2:01:47     
scale anyway it it was really good talking about um     
2:01:53     
um the the a good critique of of     
2:01:58     
experimental psychology's progress and yeah anyway okay yeah we'll     
2:02:06     
have to take a look at that um okay so this is comp yeah     
2:02:13     
competition so this is multicellular artificial neural network type architectures demonstrate computational     
2:02:19     
problem solving so we talked about this earlier uh where we have this this is     
2:02:25     
the um visual     
2:02:32     
abstract I'll zoom in a little bit here so this is where we have these bacterio     
2:02:38     
cultures uh where we have bacteria that are doing I guess Quorum sensing and     
2:02:43     
they're expressing genes that you know they can express genes in a way that's almost switch like and you get these you     
2:02:51     
can also Express phenotypic States in this way and then they can do computations so they're actually you     
2:02:59     
know each flask can do certain uh sets of give certain sets of answers to to     
2:03:04     
different problems that you propose to it and then you know the solution is the answer that it gives so it's you know     
2:03:11     
that seems a little magical so let's get into the details of this um so the abstract reads um here we report a     
2:03:19     
modular multicellular system cre by mixing and matching discrete engineered bacteria cells so in each of these     
2:03:26     
flasks you have certain U Back engineered uh genetic circuits that you     
2:03:32     
can then trigger and you can get them to express different things so you know if I create a strain that has one uh     
2:03:41     
construct in it and get it to give a certain answer and if I have another construct I can give it another answer     
2:03:48     
which is you know not necessarily like uh surprising because I I've engineered     
2:03:54     
the cell that way and or the gene circuit that way but you know we can then combine them together to solve     
2:04:01     
multiple computational decision problems so you have these systems where you grow     
2:04:06     
these bacterial cells and cultures you get you engineer them for certain competencies and then you put them into     
2:04:14     
you mix and match into different flasks and you can get them to solve more complex problems so you see that it's     
2:04:21     
giving each each flask a problem so this problem is is for a prime number this     
2:04:26     
other problem is seven factorial divisible by 7 * 7 + 1 / 2 and it is     
2:04:33     
either no or yes and then of course you could combine these into a larger     
2:04:38     
problem and give solutions for those components of the problem uh the modular system is based     
2:04:45     
on a set of engineered bacteria that are modeled as an artificial neuros syapse so each basically the analogy you're     
2:04:51     
using is that I can use a gene circuit in each one of these bacterial cultures     
2:04:57     
as an artificial neural synapse so if you take different strains     
2:05:02     
and you put them in a co-culture meaning I'm taking like some cells out of the first flask some cells out of the second     
2:05:09     
flask and I put them in a third flask where they're in mixed population um if I do this um I can form     
2:05:18     
a single layer artificial neural network type architecture that can perform computational tests so essentially     
2:05:25     
you're getting answers from these cells and you're forming this sort of     
2:05:30     
artificial neural network type architecture basically each each population of cells is a different layer     
2:05:37     
in that on neural network so it's like kind of going way back to the early days of neural networks where people would     
2:05:43     
analyze the layers and you know kind of you know they're hidden layers of course but we kind of know what the hidden     
2:05:49     
layers are um as a demonstration we constructed devices that function as a full sub uh     
2:05:57     
subtractor and a full adder so you have devices that can I guess subtract and     
2:06:03     
devices that can add so device a device would be like these co- cultures that     
2:06:08     
are basically these layers uh and then you can like kind of model the layers as     
2:06:14     
a very simple neural network or model the answers that are given as a simple neural network so you have these devices     
2:06:21     
of fun is a full subtractor and full adder the system is also capable of solving problems such as determining if     
2:06:27     
a number between 0 and 9 is a prime number and if a letter between a and L     
2:06:32     
is a vowel so it's trying to identify different stimuli in in a certain way so     
2:06:38     
I'm not really sure how it's like asking the questions I guess that's my problem     
2:06:43     
I can't get access to the paper but um but basically it's ask it's solving     
2:06:49     
these problems or it's posing these problems and the uh Gene circuit is solving them and then you have this co-     
2:06:55     
culture where which solves a bunch of these questions you might Harse the question it's kind of like a large     
2:07:01     
language model where you prompt it in different ways and you just find the right prompt to get it to learn in that     
2:07:08     
way finally we built a system that determines the maximum number of pieces of a pie that can be made for a given     
2:07:14     
number of straight cuts this work may have importance in biocomputer technology development and multicellular     
2:07:21     
Sy synthetic biology so um yeah I can't access this right now um yeah yeah and I     
2:07:30     
mean I I take it you already checked saub oh I didn't check it right now     
2:07:37     
but just I'm just kind of curious because it this relates to another paper     
2:07:43     
um uh in terms of     
2:07:54     
um it's doing a cloud flare check no no it doesn't have it um     
2:08:04     
so very in brain organoid     
2:08:09     
um just pass the the the next paper     
2:08:16     
assembly the tissue talks this wrong whis um     
2:08:21     
uh tissue talks from October 16th programmable organoids guiding sulfate     
2:08:28     
with synthetic biology and neuromorphic circuits okay um     
2:08:33     
was you know it was very similar what what Ron     
2:08:41     
let me let me see if I can find his um uh if I can I think he's got a good     
2:08:46     
website okay um just just in terms of somebody def definely trying to develop     
2:08:53     
that same kind of Technology if you will or yeah look here we     
2:09:00     
um you know not necessarily super interested himself in     
2:09:07     
terms of the um I'll just drop it at the bottom of of Organo Chanel     
2:09:15     
um but somebody who's definitely working on um the the those kinds of genetic     
2:09:24     
circuits and you know and lot you     
2:09:30     
know genetic programmable logic or synthetic bio programmable     
2:09:37     
logic yeah just just reminds me a lot of that     
2:09:43     
yeah so they're this group is doing this and trying to do this in neurons or in bacteria or what are they see other     
2:09:50     
public or I don't know Vice yeah     
2:09:56     
uh cellular you know like like not not n not neurons you know     
2:10:04     
um yeah so depending on depending on what what yeah like he'll use whatever model     
2:10:12     
or whatever whatever organism makes the most sense but potentially just you know     
2:10:17     
eoli or Yeast or something like that like um unless unless it's it's you know     
2:10:26     
medically related and then it's like oh can I do this in say human cells or     
2:10:31     
something like that yeah you know yeah looks like he has like a paper on     
2:10:37     
synthetic genetic circuits to uncover the oct four trajectories of successful reprogramming of human fiber blasts     
2:10:44     
which is interesting because that's definitely meleon cells um     
2:10:51     
you know like like he's doing he's he's absolutely doing you know human human     
2:10:57     
research too right you know it's they might they might proof of concept stuff and simpler stuff you know like like and     
2:11:06     
and yeah like it was just a really nice integration of kind of synthetic bio and     
2:11:13     
Organics right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah     
2:11:19     
but but but you could you could could absolutely see you know how to use     
2:11:26     
his work to do bio computation right you know and and I I kind of like     
2:11:34     
those groups that where it's just like that's not necessarily their Focus right     
2:11:40     
but they they yeah yeah so some sometimes that     
2:11:46     
it's like they come up with even better Solutions yeah you know and and     
2:11:52     
potentially more scalable ones you know but um um but this is this is a very     
2:11:59     
different kind of Bio computation from you know again I I always think of or     
2:12:05     
you know I'm I'm so old I think of the kind of you know DNA Computing like     
2:12:14     
like are there ways to do kind of parallel computation with with     
2:12:22     
biomolecules that could be conversationally you know you you could     
2:12:28     
achieve quote Supremacy over classical Computing algorithms right right and and     
2:12:36     
these are not that that's not this Focus right all right that's great uh so yeah     
2:12:44     
well thanks for attending I think we had a good session today a lot of reviewed a lot of stuff and and uh hopefully we can     
2:12:52     
move on the um organized stuff soon and and you know get yeah and you know do     
2:13:00     
you think um Stefan will be enough for the open source uh Symposium or you know     
2:13:07     
that part of the active inference uh what do you mean like would he be involved or I don't think so no no no     
2:13:14     
just it's like like if he's the only speaker Oh Oh you mean yeah that would be fine if he's the only speaker like     
2:13:21     
yeah you're sending out the invites yeah I just want to make sure we get one person but we could have two if we if we     
2:13:27     
need to yeah yeah I just I don't know if if you know     
2:13:32     
uh for aner and yck that's just that that's not a time frame in which they     
2:13:39     
are willing to move oh okay so we just we're kind of down to the I I I     
2:13:44     
certainly haven't heard back from okay yeah well okay yeah all right all right thanks     
2:13:52     
okay talk to you later take care take care bye bye

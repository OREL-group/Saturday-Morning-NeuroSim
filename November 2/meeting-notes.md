## NOTES
Create an artificial brain that learns with exponentiated gradients.

* brain-reproducing features.

* NeuroAI --> gradients and neuromodulation.

* great talk --> Are we on the way to Cincinnati?


Brain organoids and bacterial (genetic).

* circuits that can solve --> programmable biocomputational circuits. 

* biocomputational with biomolecules (E. coli, Yeast, Mammals).

* groups that don't work in an area, come up with better solutions.


Three-organoid Assembloid (brainorganogenesis.org).


Jesse: a lot of work, behind the scenes. Jen's mental health grant.

* progressive: people open to doing science in new ways, open-source and open science.

* applied data science, meta-science. Quantified takes on History of Science.

* what does a modern bibliometric approach look like?


Symmetry-breaking in organoids (spatial plane helps along organogenesis).

--> spatial context, who are your neighbors and what are their mechanics?

* mechanobiology and physical forces. Discussed in cortical sheet development (convolutions).


Xenobots (when not given their tissue context). Have potential to form new things. AI modeling of the cell. 

* priority-setting agenda. Software engineering, research staff.

* gut organoids dynamics. Reaction-Diffusion scaling --> encourage spatial structure.

* technique complexity, advancements.


#bio-evolution --> geometry of multicellularity. Raymond Goldstein on Volvox. Permitted by organoid, 
general project description (build on Braingeneers project).

IPAM meeting, computational genetics. Links are representative.

* Computational Genomics Summer Institute. #brain-organoids channel.

Michigan --> foundation model summer school. Introduction to foundation model white paper.

* Frontier Models (Gebru's critique of the term). 

* calls for paticipation (mine annual events for key concepts and items). Distill down to progress.

* Perlin Noise expertise -- not public yet (company).


Niantic --> AR games. Location-based environments.

* paper had video links to the 2018 meeting.

* Stanford Stem Cell Center -- new paper with a 4-organoid assembloid.

* CompuCell3D -- Glazier's platform, Glimprint.


Human Genome Project hype. Risk-aversion for project, funding.

* had to be done, but applications are lacking.

* similar problem with hype. Biology is complicated. 

* scale, reductionism, need people to learn flexible thinking.


Galaxy --> spin off of Celera. Scientific Linux, Incentive structures. 

* paper -- text analysis of journal articles over past 20 years. Stronger terms for certainty than in past.




Hussain: computed tomography work.

## NOTES
Jesse: fast but good week. Reading group, cybernetics. Brain organoids.

* #behind-the-scenes channel (JoPro Discord).

* Cognition Futures collaborators (same phenomenological space).

* event @ MIT? Diverse developmental intelligence.

* post-post-Hexagonal: CogSci (synesthaesia) --> evolutionary reasons.


UAlbany -- push different initiatives to that group. Aethos -- AI incubator (smaller, less defined 
groups).

* objective: let us help you do AI.

* different steps, technique that goes into organoids.


Bioprinting, Curvature/Life, History Problems, Profusion.

* 10 areas where equipment, materials come into play.

* scalability, quality control. Output --> complex electrophysiology.

* what you want comes from a very aged organoid.


Organoid intelligence: really pushes Biocomputational interface.

* biohybrid electrodes at the electrode-tissue interface.

* Nanofab aspects of this, getting more advanced.


Shubham -- RL in MESA --> ABM folder (pure agent-based model). 

* looking over agent.py. classIssue(mesa.Agent). Opening and closing times.

* which agent can take up space (individual cells)?

* if active-neighbors --> selected issues update if selected, solved.

* add contributors to the schedule. max_iter = 1000.


Reinforcement Learning -- RL agent, issue described solved attributes.

* action space has 4 degrees of freedom (N,E,S,W,NE,NW,SE,SW). Leads to observation space.

* grid_to_observation() -- both are using the same policy, rewarded differently.

* contributor vs. maintainer policies. Attributes won't get refreshed.

* OSS model -- MESA visualization. Shubham's work on Github repo.


GSoC lightening talk, Sarrah's work has been accepted (9/25 @ 4pm UTC).

* 3-4 slides --> calculator demo, other short demos.

Outline:

* 3 Summers of OSS --> open-source sustainability, Why use LLMs?, Demo (~90 sec). 

* Jopro projects development. NYCWiC meeting -- plans for venue.

* MH4H -- mental health initiative. Clinical work. CBTs -- cognitive enhancement.

* "Black Skin, White Masks" -- uniform template for all WGs.


What is a system's intended function? EGRT reference, intended cause and flow.

* #whiteboard channel. Bridge to finished concepts.

* project incubators, Harvard Innovation Lab. How to organize? 

* JoPro --> shopping mall for projects. Macro front-end.


Slime mold simulations -- novel means to create structure.

* Neuromorphic revolution workshop. Different compute architectures.

* Alt-computing: reservoir (stochastic networks) vs. neuromorphic (oscillator, spiking, slime molds).

* combinatorial solutions done by nature. Structural elements -- DevoWorm.


Build-a-cell seminar --> Gene Regulatory Networks. Single-cell computation.

* what is intracellular intelligence? Computation for lack of a better term....

* isotopes of lithium --> quantum effects in the brain. Molecular consequences of lithium action.

## NOTES
Session 1: Q2. Embodiment Aspect of NeuroAI.

* DevOps -- before time, software development was chaotic.

ACT-R paper: bringing things to behavioral data.

* Activision --> have the best behavioral data on the planet.


From Introduction to "The Complex World" --> constructs for complexity.

* why do we have cell phones, "vantage points" paper, as opposed to other things?

* formalize a project description Krakauer's take on complexity science.

* teleomic vs. non-teleomic matter. Krakauer -- synthesis of complexity theory.


What's the next version of 4E? Information processing and cognition --> cultural criticism.

* structuralism vs. post-structuralism. Slice off half of CogSci hexagon. Align with "complexity" or methods.

* share folder of screenshots. SciOps. DevOps -- before time, software development was chaotic.

* oscillations -- lots of use in embodied systems, not so much in thinking systems?

* greater multiscale perspectives (sensu Levin)?


Web-scale projects --> multi-node maintainability.

* why do you need a messaging library? Data Lakes? Constant flow mentality.

* AWS added features because customers asked for them.

* human connectome project (laptop vs. cloud).


SciOps paper --> authors from Datajoint, Natuonal Labs, and various open-source people.

* Numenta --> anomaly -- non-DL, NNs. Detection company, open-source company, from a long time ago.


Deep Learning is very general. 

Universal Laws <-- Networks --> Structural
Post-structural, Chaos <-- Networks

* evolution-learning connection (old problems in PopGen).

* diffusion models, evolutionary algorithms, statistical mechanics.

* evolutionary algorithms behave the same way (very GECCO-y).

* dist2dist --> ML categorization.

* dist2dist --> stat mech, mutational distance, probabilistic approach.


Fit cognitive models to data --> neurophysiology models to data --> Dynamic Causal Model.

* implementation of data analysis --> cortical column model. Not brain, but pyramidial cells in contical columns.

* postdoc-level people @ Numenta live-streamed meetings. 

* CogSci reading group channel --> 

* SF CogSci reading group: Braitenberg Vehicle discussion --> by vehicle 5 or 6, complexity that you can understand/interpret.

* Richard Watson/Jeff Clune --> modularity, evolution brought in @ vehicle #6.

* IPAM -- Mathematics of Intelligence (some in Bioevolution). IPAM Workshop -- previous workshops. Multiscale, collective intelligence.

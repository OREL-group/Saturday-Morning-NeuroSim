Transcript     
0:02     
hello all right let's start oh yeah we meeting     
0:09     
today so welcome to our meeting um this week we had two meetings uh     
0:16     
aside from this one we had the diva worm meeting and the cybernetics meeting     
0:24     
cybernetics meeting we finished up the Mike 11 paper on memory which was I     
0:30     
guess we continued with it I don't know if we're actually finished I think we are finished with it and that was where we talked a lot     
0:38     
about memory encoding and had his own takes on what he called diverse intelligences     
0:45     
so you know beyond the sort of standard metaphors and models of memory en     
0:50     
coding talking about how memory is distributed and how you can think about     
0:56     
memory as this bow tie mechanism between two Network     
1:01     
modules so that was interesting um we tied it a little bit to cybernetics     
1:08     
but uh you know we that's something that if we want to tie it more to     
1:13     
cybernetics that would be good um and then the D.A meeting was uh good     
1:22     
we talked about a number of different articles in that     
1:28     
meeting and so that was was uh our meeting schedule for this week we're     
1:33     
going to be taking a break probably for the holiday soon I think maybe we'll have one more meeting this year Saturday     
1:42     
meeting and probably one more week of meetings maybe like dorm we'll have two     
1:49     
more dorm or something like that before the end of the year so you know we're finishing up     
1:57     
2024 I think it was a good year I think we did some interesting things I'd like     
2:02     
to do more in 2025 um you know everyone wants to do     
2:08     
more in 2025 I guess but um we'll have to kind of think about     
2:14     
the plans for that I know Jesse posted on uh New York celebration women in     
2:19     
Computing so that's coming up uh there other conference     
2:25     
opportunities coming up like the uh the embodied intelligence     
2:32     
conference um I don't know if there are any other opportunities we'll have to     
2:38     
look be on the lookout for them so so I wanted to bring a couple things     
2:45     
to people's attention first is that if you're on Blue Sky there is an orthogonal web starter     
2:51     
pack that starter pack has personal accounts and some other accounts like     
2:57     
lab accounts I don't know if it allows s me to put in uh starter packs of their     
3:03     
own so like we have starter packs that we'd like to you know we we put a couple starter packs in the slack but I don't     
3:11     
think you can actually put starter packs in the starter pack so it's uh I think they're feeds and     
3:17     
posts here I think you can put feeds yeah so if you know of anyone who should be in the starter pack let me     
3:23     
know uh there's also this interesting article uh from I guess this is     
3:29     
Coalition s's blog Coalition s is a Blog about open science and Open     
3:36     
Access uh there's this uh initiative called plan s so that's their     
3:43     
Coalition um if you go to plan s they talk about what they're all about     
3:50     
here uh Open Access is foundational to the scientific     
3:56     
Enterprise uh you know they're basically against public location pay walls um and then no signs should be     
4:04     
locked behind pay walls so plan s has been developed     
4:09     
whereby research funders will mandate that access to research Publications that are generated through research     
4:15     
grants that they allocate it must be fully and immediately open and cannot be     
4:21     
monetized in any way so basically it's the kind of uh it's sort of having a     
4:27     
mandate where if you give a research Grant the paper should be free and     
4:33     
unlocked and it shouldn't be monetized that's the idea behind plan     
4:38     
s and um so they they kind of have their     
4:43     
uh you know statement here this from 2018 so if you go back to this     
4:50     
article uh they talk about how web up science takes a step back and so web of     
4:55     
science is an indexing service of a company called CL ofate and they've     
5:01     
decided to remove Eli from a citation index or citation cited index expanded     
5:07     
or CS or scie I'm sorry and so this is     
5:13     
um you know this is bad for E life because you know the people use these     
5:18     
indices to sort of rank Publications rank journals the whole Enterprise of     
5:24     
ranking you might argue as bad but you know that's how a lot of people uh     
5:30     
you you know they use that as sort of a metric for Quality although they     
5:35     
probably shouldn't for on various reasons so you know the whole reason why     
5:40     
they did this is because ewi has this open publishing um approach that they've     
5:46     
been using where you know they publish a paper kind of as a pre-print then they     
5:52     
have peerreview a peer review process that's transparent the peer reviews get     
5:57     
posted to the article stub and then if the article passes peer review according     
6:05     
to the Criterion that are set out then it becomes a publication and so you have these     
6:12     
pre-prints and Publications and even though it's noted that there's like this preprint aspect     
6:17     
and this publication aspect a lot of people have complained about it and about the quality of the work and things     
6:25     
like that so you know it's hard to say whether that criticism is     
6:30     
you know legitimate in the sense that it's um raising a real issue or rather     
6:35     
that it's like this proxy for you know Open Access     
6:41     
fights and so that's kind of what they are talking about this article and web     
6:46     
of science basically decided to exclude e and it makes it tough to swallow since     
6:53     
web of science is run by a publishing institution so or a for-profit     
6:58     
publishing Institution so basically that's what they're talking about here and this organization plan asks us     
7:06     
all about keeping things open and uh you know uh profit free I guess     
7:13     
is the idea and they think of profit is a conflict of interest so um they     
7:20     
they're basically uh motivate this article by talking about the origins e     
7:25     
life so if we want to reap the full benefits of Century science scholarly     
7:32     
communication needs reform and Innovation that's why the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and like-minded     
7:38     
research organizations are supporting new approaches of scientific publishing e was founded in 2012 by the max plun     
7:45     
society welome which is a British institution and hhmi which is an     
7:51     
American institution and you know they they eife has been you know innovating ever since     
7:58     
they started and this new publication model I think is about two or three years old so it hasn't been around that     
8:04     
long but it's proven to be you know um there have been some cases where they've     
8:10     
had controversial papers but that's true of every journal and you know so they     
8:15     
they're about the record is you know there     
8:22     
so given this record of uh so okay uh in its first major contribution     
8:28     
e life and improve peer review by embedding consultation among peer reviews into the process given this     
8:34     
record it is troubling that web of science recently decided to D list eif from its major index especially     
8:41     
considering that its publicly stated criteria for Journal evaluation include the requirement that published content     
8:47     
must reflect adequate and effective peer review Andor editorial     
8:53     
Insight rather than helping move scholarly communication forward web of Science by punishing a leaner in field     
8:59     
is in fact holding it back so this is where um and this is one of the     
9:05     
highlights what makes clar's decision so counterproductive is that other journals     
9:10     
which use the traditional and confidential peer review model remain indexed in the web of     
9:16     
science even though some of the Articles they publish also have inadequate or incomplete evidence the difference is     
9:23     
that they do not label these articles as such so it's interesting that in the light of kind of how El life views     
9:31     
transparency they're actually being hurt by that instead of being you know instead of not being     
9:37     
transparent and people thinking well that's of higher quality it's really interesting how you know we try to     
9:46     
balance this sort of transparency in publication transparency in the     
9:51     
process and how you know people perceive quality and it's really interesting     
9:58     
because there is this ISS issue of like you know there is this tradition of not being able to publish negative     
10:05     
results and a phenomenon called the file drawer problem which means that you publish only the best work from a body     
10:13     
of research and but that what that means is that all the stuff that failed or all     
10:19     
the stuff that wasn't so consistent with your original hypotheses get put in the     
10:24     
file drawer we don't know about those we don't see those we only see the best stuff it's like we see the peros path     
10:30     
and not the whole body of work and so in the interest of transparency you might publish all of that you might publish     
10:37     
the negative results and you might publish the sort of the file drawer     
10:43     
contents and you know you have a decision to make as to whether that is     
10:49     
uh of quality or not even though it's really about giving us all the     
10:55     
information about say a certain approach or a certain hypothesis     
11:00     
so there is this it seems like there's this sort of this countervailing Force to being     
11:07     
sort of radically open in terms of Open Access which is that people have their own preconceived     
11:13     
notions of what is quality or what is like you know the highest     
11:20     
standards and you know it by one set of Standards those are the highest     
11:26     
standards by by another set of standards that incomplete so this is really interesting     
11:32     
this kind of um you know tension so this is beyond past fail peer     
11:39     
review so traditional journals use the editorial decision that publish as the signal to their readers that the article     
11:47     
is past peer review in the journal's standard of sound science so this signal to the review to the readers is     
11:52     
important because that's what we're talking about it's like signaling to the readers maybe the uh you know what what     
12:00     
the quality is and it's interesting because like I said the quality you can     
12:05     
use a simple signal to tell people what the quality of the work is but at the     
12:11     
same time that work can be highly polished and not tell the whole story so     
12:16     
that signal can be very um you know very quick very cheap or it can be a deeper     
12:22     
sort of analysis of the entire body of work and what we present as the signal     
12:28     
maybe is really the key to successful Open Access uh before reading this article I     
12:34     
didn't want to think about it that way but it kind of came to me as I was reading and thinking about this     
12:41     
problem as a proxy the decision to publish can only transmit one piece of information and that is approval in     
12:48     
contrast uif uses editorial assignments produced collaboratively by E life     
12:53     
reviewers and publish with the article as a proxy for the peer review process so they have these     
13:00     
multiple pieces of information that are giving you an assessment of the quality     
13:05     
and then rather than being a one-dimensional stamp of approval elif editorial assessments summarize     
13:11     
strengths and weaknesses and use standard terms to rank articles in two     
13:16     
Dimensions those two dimensions are significance and strength of     
13:22     
evidence so usually uh with if you take like nature say for example there would     
13:28     
be a heavy emphasis on significance or you know like how     
13:34     
interesting is the question that's being asked or the topic sometimes if it's     
13:39     
controversial it gets into nature and if it's not so controversial it might not get into     
13:45     
nature which is an interesting thing but that's aside from the significance     
13:51     
Dimension then the strength of evidence which is the other dimension is you know how how well do     
13:58     
you make your argument you know to use the right statistical tests you use the right you know do the     
14:04     
right experiments uh reviewers are always asking for like new analysis new experiments it's because you want to     
14:11     
sort of sharpen that strength of evidence or make it stronger and so that's you know really     
14:18     
kind of what we're looking for but the strength of evidence also includes all     
14:23     
the file drawer stuff and so if we you know put that into the pot our evidence     
14:29     
may not be as strong but it gives us a better uh assessment of the quality or     
14:35     
of the sort of the overall you     
14:40     
know allows us to assess the set of hypotheses or the approach in a better     
14:47     
light so that's um kind of you know this is the problem too in terms of being     
14:54     
open access we could call it transparent access where we want want to really get     
14:59     
this good set of signals to tell us what the quality of the work is well we also want to get this set of signals that     
15:04     
tells us how plausible is what people are proposing in their     
15:11     
paper so then they talk about in a lot of publishing the rank standard terms     
15:16     
for strength of evidence R ranges from inadequate and incomplete at the low end     
15:21     
to compelling and exceptional at the high end usually when you do a peer review     
15:27     
you're often asked you know what is the strength of this paper are the experimental methods inadequate to you     
15:34     
know complete or is the approach incomplete to exceptional or you know     
15:40     
they're they usually give you this sort of range of options to choose from so that's what we usually rank the paper on     
15:47     
and it's you know maybe that's not the way to do that but that's a I think a a     
15:53     
very to the point or sharp metric for an Editor to look at that and say okay     
15:58     
that's what basically what I thought or you know that's that's what our experts in the field think     
16:05     
so um as a result eif does occasionally publish articles at eif reviewers judge     
16:12     
in Mark as having inadequate or incomplete evidence after final revision so this isn't where you just get the     
16:19     
pre-print version you get the final version so it's like after the reviews and after the editorial     
16:25     
consideration uh so that that can happen but that can happen in any publishing model because remember we're just taking     
16:33     
like a small piece of the evidence we're taking like maybe two or three people to     
16:39     
put eyes on the paper and anything that gets out there will be judged more     
16:45     
widely after it's been accepted and the stamp of approval has been put on it so it's always a problem we can't have a     
16:52     
thousand peer reviewers I mean actually we can if we do open peer review but     
16:57     
often times if we had a th000 peer reviewers we wouldn't get any stronger signal than we would from two or three     
17:04     
people so you know that that problem can happen where you have these kind of false positives where you have something     
17:10     
that's accepted for publication and you put that stamp of approval on it but then it becomes clear after a while that     
17:18     
this is a inadequate or incomplete approach or that the evidence is inadequate or incomplete so this is     
17:25     
always a problem in every journal and they don't talk about in terms of false positives but that's basically what it     
17:30     
is it's a false positive of the peer review system so this is always a problem in journals and the idea is that     
17:36     
minimize that fraction and there's no evidence that any one publishing model does that any     
17:43     
better than any other and it's just a fact of life     
17:48     
um and so E's model thus makes visible a reality of scientific publishing that is     
17:54     
currently invisible so it's not that they're uncovering like they're you know     
18:00     
they're kind of uncovering uh they're kind of uncovering this sort of flaw in the     
18:06     
whole process it's not that they're actually encouraging bad behavior I     
18:11     
guess that's the the kind of the idea here and so you know this is a problem     
18:16     
where you sometimes publish articles with incomplete or inadequate evidence and how does this happen this     
18:24     
happens because you know you don't have all the information a lot of     
18:30     
um you know you only have like two or three people who put their eyes on the paper before it's approved so you know     
18:36     
often times those people don't go through like data sets to make sure that they're consistent or you know they     
18:43     
don't really actually try to replicate the study and you just kind of look at it and you say what is this good enough     
18:50     
to be published does this look right okay if it looks right then it's okay     
18:56     
and so we don't actually go through had replication or we don't actually go through the you know excruciating     
19:04     
details of the study we usually go through the summary and that's how that can happen um given that that's the case     
19:11     
though I think their false positive rate is actually quite low across the board like you know you you think of a false     
19:17     
positive as something that has to be corrected or retracted those are very you know relatively rare so I don't     
19:23     
think it's really that big of a problem in general     
19:29     
sometimes you know you get people who intentionally commit fraud but that is     
19:35     
rare and it's also very hard to really kind of get at it first     
19:41     
pass so okay so then they have this last part     
19:46     
here journals that conduct peerreview in the open or ensure transfer prior peer rreview reports clearly Advanced     
19:53     
adequate and effective peer review and should thus be rewarded not punished by     
20:00     
indexers so you know what we're talking about here is that we have Publishers     
20:05     
like ewi we have authors who submit papers we have reviewers who review     
20:12     
papers we have editors who sort of Marshall reviewers and make a final decision and then we have our um     
20:20     
indexers who index those journals to make sure people can find them people     
20:26     
can in in like a tool like web of science or that they have some sort of     
20:32     
um you know they have sort of a formal record of it so this this is where you know     
20:40     
this whole chain exists and we usually think about Open Access is like just the     
20:46     
journal level or the pre-print level but it's actually all those pieces     
20:53     
together so this is you know they're just making this is an opinion piece largely this is where you know you know     
20:59     
they look at this as you know a potential career threat where a journal isn't indexed or it's not given a impact     
21:07     
factor and so then it's not viewed as being an equivalent venue for publication and it     
21:14     
can affect people in terms of tenures and promotions and other things last statement here unfortunately     
21:22     
the decision by Clare ofate to delist Eli from s is a barrier to a future     
21:28     
where the inevitable errors of authors peer reviewers and editors can effectively be effectively corrected     
21:35     
through expert input that everyone can see and benefit from uh well that's a little bit about Open Access and a     
21:41     
little bit about our webs new social media presence and or I     
21:47     
guess continuing social media presence so I don't know if we wanted to do     
21:53     
updates Jesse did you want to do an update     
21:58     
sorry excuse me um I'll say a few things I mostly have things to to     
22:05     
tease um out a bit and not anything     
22:10     
concrete [Music] um um at large I     
22:18     
am basically finishing up my second to last term uh for my program     
22:26     
so that's where I am and it's uh you know going okay I'm I'm I'm very much     
22:34     
looking forward to kind of a quiet period     
22:42     
um to sort out a lot of things I think the most relevant thing I can say is     
22:49     
um I would really like to I don't know if it will be have a     
22:55     
meeting but schedule some intentional [Music]     
23:01     
um discussion um in the next few weeks I know we might not meet and I know we     
23:07     
have other things to do but I'd like to really sort out certain things in terms     
23:15     
of project management or projects to pursue um coming     
23:20     
January um ahead of January ahead of January I like to have stuff in place to invite people to and and just and to to     
23:28     
do um so I don't really know what that     
23:34     
would be and I don't I don't know if we're going to have another cybernetics meeting managers like that and I know we     
23:42     
people here too but I think setting some goal um for     
23:49     
that would be good like I don't know it's we all have a whole lot of things going on so I don't I don't really know     
23:56     
when to say that but maybe some Friday noon time or or some other time um     
24:03     
because I don't I we can talk about some things now but but I think I'd like to also have     
24:09     
a kind of a maybe it can be something where like we essentially do a I'll do a lab     
24:17     
manager thing of kind of saying hey why don't you why don't we think     
24:23     
about XYZ and and come back later and then come back with thoughts about it and and     
24:30     
then we make decisions about it um and what to be more concrete than that     
24:35     
there's I I guess I didn't my chat didn't s because I had to come back in here but there's three things on the     
24:42     
docket right now uh the Nick Wick um submissions that are do in about     
24:48     
10 days just figure out what to do with that uh we robot I might submit a poster of that     
24:56     
just do in January and the embodied intelligence conference     
25:01     
which I think is just of openly accepting you the their breakout     
25:07     
sessions are sort of you can kind of rolling invitation to that or whatever so those are three core things     
25:17     
um that we should make decisions about I know Bradley messaged me he kind of say oh do you want to do this for Nick Wick     
25:22     
or not and in terms of Nick Wick the short answer of that is Maybe     
25:29     
um I may also suggest sort of they have a     
25:34     
different kind of submission this time for a workshops which fit really well with a lot of things we've been talking about basically what I did for the other     
25:41     
active inference stuff and what I I've kind of been doing some writings that up really soon about that but just in that     
25:48     
space of of sort of man management or leader I don't really know to call I actually like the word navigation like     
25:54     
facilitating navigation or navigating through this stuff but a conventional terms being leadership for research or     
26:01     
leadership and management for research and Innovation you know um that's     
26:06     
something that could be quite at hand there and and had a positive     
26:14     
um when I mentioned it in internally people were little excited about that as a     
26:21     
possibility other than that um I am     
26:30     
doing a lot of recalibrating of some of my aims and efforts and thinking about what I want to be doing in the next year     
26:36     
ahead because the next year um I will hopefully be graduating from     
26:44     
my degree program and then it's sort of like um what's next after some of that I     
26:50     
know this year has been a little bit slower um largely because of grad school and the things I've been     
26:56     
doing um so as I come out of that you know where things going where     
27:03     
going with the lab directly with jopro with plot Twisters which has sort of been     
27:09     
[Music]     
27:15     
um in in its own state of being with that in mind     
27:22     
or the only other thing I concretely have to say is um     
27:31     
joepro it's basically I I submitted the application through me but it basically through me and     
27:37     
joepro um we have a small Grant award which is about     
27:46     
um I'll give more details later but essentially kind of a smaller opportunity but what what it what it was     
27:53     
the submission was basically around um     
28:00     
uh sort of     
28:05     
uh Civic engagement but but sort of being a little more future minded or     
28:11     
future oriented about it so what I what I proposed for this submission was accepted what we've been     
28:18     
funded for in a small way is essentially an     
28:24     
applied um Frontier map kind of a deal but it's     
28:32     
you know those they're a little bit you know Civic engagement and Frontier map don't exactly overlap at first glance     
28:40     
but what I'm what my pitch was basically how do we um sort of B another taking it     
28:49     
might be like basics for um like trajectory awareness in understanding     
28:55     
how things develop um and yeah it's it's more an academic level it's not     
29:02     
like I'm I'm a bit agnostic right now if it's gonna I don't think it's gonna it's     
29:07     
not really necessar going to be super policy uh like like governance oriented     
29:13     
but a bit more you know     
29:18     
um dipping into some of the philosophy and some of     
29:24     
the um lenses like you have like I I     
29:29     
mentioned racing like the Fuko um stuff which is which is a very you know French     
29:35     
critical theory French um post structuralists you know heavy heavy     
29:40     
heavy philosophical stuff um but also um we've mentioned a long for a     
29:47     
long time we mentioned things like you know and the Coan system and of revolutions and normal science and pre     
29:54     
paradigmatic science and poer and and other people so I'm I'm kind of imagining     
30:02     
um a sort of basic synthesis of     
30:08     
that um and what's interesting is that there'll be a little gamification um of of of it making a     
30:15     
little curriculum about it and and leading people through and sort of Education of program about that to that     
30:23     
and um I think there'd be some overlap with     
30:28     
um plot Twisters there if if people want to do it there um I know there's     
30:35     
some kind of the answer is yes but but we haven't talked about everything uh and there's also a few     
30:42     
other people that I met at the inclusive gaming conference that I've reach started reaching out to one of them actually um has expressed some interest     
30:51     
so I'm being a little bit vague on purpose but in the next week or so I'll kind of re reveal directly     
31:00     
um things a bit more uh but suffice to say that will be     
31:05     
something that we do um in the next year like that'll be sort     
31:12     
of a spring spring semester deal um Into Summer     
31:18     
perhaps uh so we have that sort of I don't know if to call it applied from     
31:23     
tier map project let's say we have Nick Wick we have embodied     
31:28     
um intelligence Workshop we have we robot I really 100% want to submit something to re robot     
31:36     
um for variety of reasons um but I'm least I'm sort of least sure     
31:44     
about what that will be right now and I'm going to do a little more I might just sort of a call for ideas internally     
31:51     
uh just to kind of remind people hey we can do this and let's talk about this and I'm going to maybe I'll say like I'm going to you know     
31:58     
host a discussion about it or something in the next time because I know it you know it's s entering the weird period     
32:04     
where everybody's finals and holidays and and get sick and like this is like     
32:10     
the dead zone of a lot of things but um I'm still going to try to do some things     
32:15     
that I'll just say hey I'm going to talk about this at this time and can go that way um but yeah Nick Wick embodied     
32:25     
intelligence we robot FL Frontier map um and there's still the other     
32:32     
Fellowship that um Jen and I have worked     
32:37     
on um that we'll hear back from I think next     
32:45     
week uh which could lead to sort of a mental health related mental health     
32:52     
um working group related projects that's been     
33:00     
a little bit radio silent but I think it's just because they they internally have been you know     
33:06     
sorting things out um but that's still a thing too it     
33:12     
could happen it could not I'm no real idea um yeah so those are those are sort of     
33:18     
the I guess five um large things on my radar in terms of     
33:28     
Administration and pursuing things there's a number of other but there's like there's a few other things too we     
33:34     
kind of have to do a little bit of     
33:44     
um you know a little bit of promotional work to to to to remind the outside     
33:50     
world especially that are you know I think some of the you know people     
33:56     
of Shifting to Blue Sky we don't really have we don't you know the lab doesn't doesn't have     
34:03     
um I don't we don't really even do emails anymore do we because I'm not getting I'm     
34:08     
not we we don't really promote a lot to the outside so I think now that there's     
34:14     
a big Shi from Twitter U could have to remind people yes we're going to be doing XYZ so     
34:20     
um I think I think we're going to have to kind of choose a few to highlight at some point whether it's the cybernetic     
34:26     
stuff which is a lot going on we could do a whole thing on like physical memory and and and     
34:33     
um you know the 11 stuff and and cybernetics uh there's also a big like     
34:40     
my complexity thing I keep talking about with crack hour vision of complexity that is um I've been a bit wayed on     
34:48     
pursuing anything with because of um the timing of the year that I'm in     
34:55     
but that's something that I'd love to have um people or interns or external     
35:03     
collaborators on um because that's a big question that I have and I've looked into trying to do something with with     
35:08     
the Santa face group itself I also looked at the New England complex Science     
35:15     
Institute which is closer to where I am but     
35:23     
it's it's not quite the same as the SFI let's say     
35:29     
um so I don't know I don't I     
35:34     
don't yeah so I mean I'll I will turn the mic back to     
35:41     
you barley about this but but sort of um there there's at least there's sort of     
35:47     
five specific tasks that I've mentioned and then these things like the complexity stuff like like the     
35:54     
cybernetics like the physical memory um like the bra vehicle stuff that there's been a little bit of more talk about     
36:00     
that and I'd like to do I still have a an interest in sort of making this     
36:06     
computate like sort of representational brains and phenotypes but like simulation     
36:12     
Focus like a I don't know like a more of     
36:17     
a hub directly about computer simulations and maybe agent based modeling maybe not     
36:25     
but but things of that nature um seems like if somebody does a lwh hanging fruit that we could easily you know     
36:31     
develop a bit more I'm curious of your thoughts about all those things yeah so I think that's uh good um     
36:41     
you touched on a lot of things project management so yeah we need to do like a     
36:47     
recap of this year and kind of a assessment of next year and where we stand I     
36:53     
was going through some of the structure of the lab thinking about different things that we've     
36:59     
done like kind of the what the structure of the projects are which are of course     
37:06     
always shifting so we have you know open source we     
37:11     
have I guess we call it representational brains and phenotypes which includes     
37:16     
brenberg Vehicles embodied models uh you know those kind of simulations agent based     
37:24     
simulations then that feeds back to open Source where we do a lot of the stuff with open source sustainability and     
37:31     
those kinds of agent based models and we have reinforcement learning and some machine learning that     
37:38     
straddles those two as well we have our uh sort of our society     
37:46     
ethics and technology which incorporates a lot of that plus you know ethics work     
37:52     
so social science some Humanities um and then     
37:58     
what else do we have um we have other things that we haven't touched on in a     
38:03     
while um the phasic project which is sort of physical intelligence and VR and     
38:11     
you know kind of that intersection uh you know we do the the     
38:16     
stuff with cognition Futures and of course cybernetics cybernetics has been active recently it was kind of morban     
38:23     
for a while and now it's become more active certainly in the last part this year we've really kind of focusing on     
38:29     
that so you know that's one of the things about the lab is we shift to different projects different we' shift     
38:36     
to different things that we're doing then they kind of fit into projects and then over time the projects shift to     
38:44     
respond to what we're doing so you know we take a new direction or we do some work in a certain area of that project     
38:52     
domain and you know that's where we are so it's really kind of is this is true I     
38:58     
think in any lab where you have this sort of evolution of sort of goal we     
39:04     
have these goals overarching goals in is evolution of Interest which is to say that you know you don't when you make a     
39:11     
bunch of project silos and this holds true for like fields of study you know those are kind     
39:18     
of like high level descriptors and we try we don't try to like match that as     
39:23     
much as possible we try to just do work on a dayto basis or quarterly quarterly     
39:30     
basis and that's really where everything happens right like you can't really you     
39:36     
know plan five years ahead and say this is exactly what we're going to do I mean you can if you have like a long-term     
39:42     
Grant but a lot of times even then you know you you have to go with what works     
39:47     
you have to go with what's the path of least resistance and you don't know that necessarily five years old so unless     
39:54     
it's a really really uh you know top down driven project like     
40:01     
if it were like a you know something like a project at NASA or something     
40:07     
you're not going to have that luxury of conforming to the project descriptions so we'll be doing this day-to-day stuff     
40:13     
and it'll shift our projects and so that's a project management challenge but I think you know continue     
40:20     
reassessing where we are on that's good and I've been doing some of that on my own and you've been doing some of that     
40:26     
so we should definitely get together on that um I mean you know     
40:31     
we do keep in touch on that but it's like just kind of giving a um I think a     
40:38     
more critical assessment of that at the end of the year I don't know if I'm going I may do a video on what we did     
40:45     
this year like a yearly report I might try to do that over the break when we're     
40:50     
not doing meetings um I have to get that stuff together and and I'm always amazed every     
40:56     
year you know when I do that what we the many things that we've done like if I     
41:02     
were to try to tell you off the top of my head what we did I'd probably miss like half of it and so I know we haven't     
41:08     
been as active as any years's past but you know we still have to kind of     
41:14     
summarize that and when you summarize it it makes it it's more     
41:19     
impressive um yeah this you know about getting our our workout or getting the     
41:24     
word out about what we're doing is you we do do a lot of YouTube stuff now instead of like a newsletter I used to     
41:31     
do a Weekly Newsletter which was like oh come to our meeting which is not really that     
41:38     
productive um I stopped doing that because I don't know how many people     
41:44     
wanted to hear about it every week um we could start doing like a regular blog     
41:50     
post or something recapping some of our activi certainly a quarterly kind of     
41:56     
report would be good um you know or a monthly report but that again require someone to do that I don't     
42:04     
necessarily have time for that but it's it's something that's worthwhile     
42:09     
um and then you know this uh sort of reaching out to other     
42:14     
institutes yeah that would be good to do you know um and it's kind of hard to get     
42:21     
collaborations going and if if you talk to Santa Fe they usually want to have a     
42:26     
collaboration or you know I've not noticed that they've been particularly open to people just doing     
42:33     
stuff you know so that's something that might work out might not     
42:40     
um but yeah I think we're was trying to find ways to highlight what we're doing     
42:45     
and it might be good to have like if we could figure out a way to do it that's like low     
42:52     
maintenance that would get the word out about what we're doing on a regular basis um     
42:57     
that would be good you know we could use like something like conventional social media put it out there we could use like     
43:04     
a blog post we could do other things I like you know making a video as     
43:10     
well but that's all kind of you know that takes time it takes someone to kind     
43:17     
of stick with it because we don't want to just do a couple times and then forget about it yeah so that's that's good and then     
43:25     
you know there some of these moving projects that again we have all these things going on that like educational     
43:32     
stuff that we need to kind of update people on so yeah so it looks like     
43:39     
Morgan wants to say something well I was just I was just gonna say that um D     
43:45     
Daniel fredman is the master of this oh yeah you know and and I mean you know     
43:54     
which is not to say I mean to point you know like it is it is work but it is     
44:03     
um you know it's also just about like kind of changing     
44:08     
practices like you know just how he's taking notes like during every meeting     
44:14     
right you know and and those that that kind of document can can then be you     
44:22     
know sent out once a month you know what I mean yeah it's     
44:27     
I mean it just sorry I I we had a neurx board meeting and um and I was just uh I     
44:37     
was noting the difference between that board meeting and uh Celsius board     
44:42     
meeting and you know I was just like you know this isn't how you really do board     
44:51     
meeting and you know and that's yeah anyway     
44:58     
if if if that if it was you know like if it was importance to get out something     
45:05     
once a month you know we could we could just try and you know structure this bit     
45:11     
different or um you know Etc like you know I mean I don't know if you when     
45:18     
you're taking notes did that do that does that go into a document or yeah and     
45:25     
then like you know the way people try and do or well again Daniel's the person     
45:32     
I would look to for inspiration and just in terms of like um it always seems like     
45:37     
he's contributing to a living document yeah yeah like you yeah he's     
45:45     
definitely a believer in Kota so it's like this plat right yeah right and um any but and and I just     
45:56     
wanted to to also add like you know if there is the group that I really wanted     
46:02     
to you know try and try and have a um more of a relationship with it would     
46:09     
definitely be active in active inference Institute um you know I mean one I just     
46:15     
thought that the the Symposium was really cool and um yeah and to like you know     
46:24     
they uh well just just a lot of things about how     
46:29     
they do things are you know impressive too and like I like I was saying like     
46:35     
you know I I think it's basically I'd like to be more like Daniel     
46:41     
yeah yeah he's he's good at yeah he was doing and I had forgotten about this he     
46:47     
was doing a thing with Santa Fe over the the pandemic where he did these yeah     
46:52     
live streams and yeah they're interesting I know if they're still online somewhere     
46:58     
but yeah and then Chris is doing active inference yeah he does like so to answer     
47:04     
Jesse's question from the chat which was what are the tools so or the     
47:09     
um Daniel uses something called coda.io yeah which is like an     
47:15     
interactive sort of uh data it's a database it's not quite like notion but     
47:20     
you get like it's note note taking based and you know you can create docs and     
47:26     
then the do are are in this kind of space where you can share them with people they can collaboratively edit and     
47:32     
so forth all right so I have this Archive of notes and and meetings here     
47:38     
this is like I mean this isn't a disor it's a read me in this in this folder so link to the read me but this is     
47:45     
basically an archive of Saturday morning meetings from like August 2020 to now so     
47:51     
each one of these links go to like a stub like so for November two we have like     
47:57     
uh Mast down thread and meeting recording and then notes and they're kind of like you know basically all the     
48:05     
notes I take so they're kind of organized like that um you know we have I think always     
48:14     
wanted to do like YouTube um like we have the YouTube videos and we maybe     
48:19     
need more annotation to that um where you know we go get things out of them     
48:26     
and uh you know and there's that we've done like a lot of blog posts where we've     
48:31     
basically gone through the YouTube videos and found parts of it and kind of put together timestamp links to to     
48:39     
pieces of content so there's a lot that can be done and some of it is just a matter of like finding a     
48:45     
process you know and then finding people who interested in like you know what did     
48:51     
we talk about in this meeting or that meeting going back and getting stuff and you know synthesizing things that's     
48:58     
that's something too that I think would be good for these kind of updates so if you were a call you know we okay I did     
49:05     
post a uh update on the ACT in Symposium so this is a kind of a recap of the     
49:16     
Symposium live streams and our videos that we we contributed materials here     
49:22     
and I have this on a in a playlist on our YouTube channel so we     
49:28     
have all these talks this is Stefan Bulman this is I think Jesse this is the     
49:34     
talk on open source and open science and this is the cybernetics talk so we have     
49:40     
that recap and then we of course have uh some other Recaps that we've     
49:46     
done before uh we have like the gck stuff we have uh you know Jesse provided some     
49:54     
posts on some topics here uh we have news we have uh our Recaps     
50:02     
this is a Nick Wick recap from 20203 uh this is one from oh had these     
50:09     
Saturday morning neurosin conversations so this one was on     
50:14     
um can't remember what this one was on this was on I think data ethics and some     
50:20     
other topics uh we have of course the ones on physical     
50:25     
intelligence which are pretty far back now um and we have some more conference     
50:32     
Recaps so we're doing things on the blog of different types we're doing conference Recaps topical     
50:39     
Recaps uh you know active participation like Google summer code and then some of     
50:45     
these um other types of posts where we're kind of talking about a a deep     
50:51     
dive into a topic so that stuff you know we and we don't necessarily get yet we don't     
50:57     
necessarily know who's paying attention to that so it's like you know we can put it on social media but it's hard to know     
51:04     
who's seeing what and you know it's we could try different ways of doing that     
51:10     
we could try like recapping all that in a newsletter sending it out to people then again who's on the maining list     
51:17     
who's getting it you know a lot of ways to go here and like you said um it's     
51:23     
always interesting to to recap because is so yeah your your memory of things     
51:31     
and um and what actually happens don't always L up AR one1     
51:37     
car I keep saying that the kids it's a yeah so it's so it is a     
51:46     
really useful Endeavor yeah that's because uh you you're you're reminded of     
51:52     
of of these things and um I wanted to I wanted to add     
52:00     
um uh or well just maybe a good point to talk     
52:05     
about the uh somebody reached out and started an organoid intelligence     
52:13     
slack um and GitHub and and um seems to     
52:21     
be uh I'm not familiar with this company Elevate bio     
52:27     
but they seem to be a pretty big Boston based organization and um and it's not it's     
52:34     
not affiliated with the company he's just a he's just an engineer there but     
52:42     
um but it was nice because uh I see     
52:47     
multiple people um from from both I mean so like Thomas Harding you know they're     
52:54     
people from from um John Hopkins uh Who were co-authors or in the case of     
53:02     
Harding last author um on the organoid intelligence paper and um and people     
53:10     
like Fred Jordan who's the I don't know if he's CEO or you know     
53:17     
C seu I think is the term uh from um final spark so this is the the Swiss     
53:26     
organoid intelligence company um and it's the one that I think is is probably     
53:33     
more um     
53:38     
well cortic collabs is the is the company who had the dish brain paper     
53:45     
yeah right um but I think they've been kind of     
53:52     
um kind of limited by the fact that um because they're startup that have to     
54:01     
basically you know the way they got their funding they need to come out with a product very quickly and and I think     
54:09     
it's limited the scope of their their work um final spark is is uh is a     
54:17     
passion project of the um the executives     
54:23     
of a separate of another company and U that's a spin-off of a of like an     
54:31     
inria or CA you know it's like a French um National Science Foundation kind of     
54:39     
place um they you know so they've got this successful multinational business and     
54:47     
but what they really want to work on is is growing brains and connecting computers right so it's just like I I     
54:55     
think it's one of those cases where it's just interesting how you know they're both companies but but they they have     
55:04     
very different kind of visions and and and um development timelines or     
55:09     
development priorities let's say right yeah so it's um yeah I I     
55:18     
think anyway but you get you get what I'm saying like the the um it's it's     
55:25     
something we did a a tuss transal focused ultrasounds     
55:32     
society meeting that I do with narch X and um we     
55:39     
talked a lot about different you know the kind of um bringing products to     
55:45     
Market issues yeah with neurotech and you know I and I would say     
55:51     
like organoid intelligence like like so much more difficult because of course     
55:56     
I'm not sure anybody knows what I'm not sure anybody knows what they're doing yet     
56:03     
yeah um but um anyway so yeah I I     
56:11     
um I would you know I would like to see us in     
56:17     
2025 um or I you know I should use eye     
56:23     
statements I would like to um to not post things on slack yeah in 2025 unless     
56:32     
I you know unless I've got got them all well documented in some other location     
56:38     
that is a more permanent record yeah uh and and go ahead we do have our     
56:46     
our a Discord and I was trying to mirror things Discord I I mean I should I     
56:52     
should take my own advice in terms of you know I I I W to you know I wanna     
56:57     
what would Daniel Freedman do bracelet yeah um and I don't I don't think he     
57:04     
would use you know like again like Kota or no notion seems to be what the the     
57:10     
kids at neur berkly like um I still I still don't know how this     
57:17     
beats a text file but anyway um uh yeah     
57:23     
you know like like these uh just kind of reviewing     
57:30     
um you know reviewing these two key areas organoids and computational     
57:36     
Psychiatry yeah and um and you know I I've been really happy with um progress     
57:43     
this year like we'll be going into 2025 um with you know with two you know     
57:51     
two active projects with Nara Berkeley one's the ultrasound and one the other one which they just asked about this     
57:59     
week was mentoring their their kind of wet lab dish brain uh     
58:06     
project so um the cool thing being that um at least you know for for now at     
58:14     
least we've got some wet Labs space and yeah and they've been the the first     
58:22     
group's already brought in like something like 25k in     
58:28     
funding you know so they got um these are kind of you know obviously     
58:35     
these are all smaller grants like all less than like 10K yeah um but you know     
58:42     
but this is you know this is a project that they're doing in addition to their     
58:47     
coursework right so right so this is you know I mean one of one of them's for     
58:53     
like 10k of Amazon credits but the the full waveform inversion for     
58:59     
the ultrasound is is super conversationally intensive so that's actually kind of nice um I feel like we     
59:07     
should be able to get them actual University credits or you know University compute time but anyway been     
59:16     
very cool and and one of them's actually going to go to the um um this Tyler Cohen um     
59:26     
emergent Ventures uh UN unconference in I forget if it's March     
59:34     
or January um I check yeah so that's good um thanks for the update um yeah     
59:42     
yeah I just wanted to add like like um the U computational Psychiatry would     
59:50     
would I'd like to see more progress or you know projects associated with it and     
59:56     
I don't know if that makes sense with what Jesse's been talking about in terms of mental health might not be doesn't     
1:00:03     
doesn't sound like it's the exact Focus but um uh yeah     
1:00:10     
would uh I thought it was really interesting that     
1:00:16     
um oh the I forget if it's Barrett or or rust     
1:00:23     
from um Northeastern um anyway the uh person     
1:00:30     
that we definitely know psychologist writing kind of you know science communication Works um yeah I I I'm I'm blanking now     
1:00:39     
whether it's no not not Daniela Russ but but um     
1:00:46     
anyway I'll look it up but she's she's going to go spend uh a bical year with     
1:00:53     
um is it ya is it y when it's y a l you PR     
1:01:03     
ya yeah yeah okay thanks     
1:01:08     
um who's you know one of the kind of if you will you know founders of     
1:01:16     
computational Psychiatry or certainly and it's got a modern form and um so I thought that was really     
1:01:24     
interesting that she chose that lab to to kind of embed herself in and and to     
1:01:30     
learn from um I I I will take it up before the end of the meeting in     
1:01:37     
terms of of who that is and I think it just no not Grace no no no um I I'd like     
1:01:46     
that or certainly I feel like I've been able to catch up on what Grace Lindsay is doing     
1:01:52     
because of because of her uh Sky engagement yeah so     
1:02:01     
um but uh you know I I feel like it's Barrett     
1:02:07     
just because um isn't Barett the the woman who     
1:02:15     
originally got involved to to solve like emotion detection yeah how     
1:02:21     
emotions yes yes I think I think it's her but     
1:02:26     
I'll I'll let me double check and um but again it's uh I thought it was really it     
1:02:34     
was someone where I was just like huh that's great that she's choose choosing to go be with a a real conversational     
1:02:44     
you know Psychiatry lab and and again um     
1:02:50     
it's not you know there isn't I I was just going to say that like um what this     
1:02:56     
also brought up for me was that there's kind of there's no active inference     
1:03:02     
Institute for conversational like yeah you know in the same way and you might     
1:03:08     
you might say like like you you could even say like it is you know like it     
1:03:15     
would be a good sub project for active inference right because yeah to some     
1:03:20     
degree you know what is what is active Ence except to kind of you know     
1:03:26     
Behavioral or you know this this um um very close to kind of reinforcement     
1:03:32     
learning and I like you know again following you know like Alberta plan um     
1:03:41     
uh kind of vision for reinforce you know for for artificial intelligence     
1:03:47     
development just because it brings up a lot of great topics that that could be     
1:03:54     
could be really relevant to computational Psychiatry without it being um yeah without the     
1:04:02     
same uh without necessarily the same goals     
1:04:08     
right anyway so I'll I'll stop there but I'll I'll look it up and and that would     
1:04:15     
just be the other thing I I think um you know I'd love to see some um something     
1:04:23     
that is close to like you know the work that um that was     
1:04:29     
brought up at the Active inference Symposium that um let me go let me go     
1:04:34     
say goodbye okay all right all right yeah so that's kind of the point     
1:04:40     
of active inference Institute is to like um you know kind of facilitate a     
1:04:46     
lot of active inference type projects like there are a lot of people     
1:04:51     
in the lab there who do you know it's just kind of a variety of things that are all focused on active inference     
1:04:58     
applying to active inference and how to use that set of tools and theories to do     
1:05:05     
things like that so when I you know when we did the uh Symposium you know we had     
1:05:12     
a lot of people doing their own kind of take on active inference so you know there's project management business     
1:05:18     
applications there was of course the theoretical applications and then the um     
1:05:24     
the more sort of robotics oriented applications I don't know if they had any thing on like Psychiatry I know     
1:05:31     
there were some things on um sort of behavior uh they didn't     
1:05:37     
really have a lot on Behavior Uh like like you know Behavioral Studies given sort of what     
1:05:44     
active inference is but but that's something I think that they might be interested in um you know especially in that realm     
1:05:53     
of computational psychiatry so I've been thinking about uh you know     
1:05:58     
how we might kind of put our foot into that pool and I you know I'm still kind of     
1:06:05     
interested in doing we could do a foundational paper but I don't know if we have the clout for that we could do     
1:06:12     
like a vision paper but I don't know what the value of that is so it's like you know where how do we start and it     
1:06:19     
might be interesting to like do like a you know what what I might do or what we     
1:06:24     
might do together is go back through the computational     
1:06:29     
Psychiatry materials as I said I've been mirroring them on our um Discord     
1:06:36     
server and we have so we have this long Archive of stuff and just kind of go     
1:06:42     
through and like recap everything and kind of organ like classify it put that     
1:06:47     
into like p a paper form and then put that out as a preprint and then maybe look into like     
1:06:54     
assess how active inference might fit into that like what is what are the active     
1:07:00     
inference questions that might be relevant and then use that maybe to facilitate some sort of a     
1:07:09     
collaboration so that might be something of you know for 2025 that would be     
1:07:15     
good uh but yeah I think we should try to move on that and then I don't know how it fits     
1:07:22     
into what Jesse and Jen are doing if that's something that I'm sure they     
1:07:27     
would have something that they could contribute there um as     
1:07:39     
well sorry I was just running outside to yeah get them get them out the door     
1:07:49     
yeah they're my daughter's going to go see Taylor Swift oh okay     
1:07:55     
very important yeah     
1:08:01     
yeah okay um so yeah we we'll come back to that and then we'll see and and I     
1:08:08     
think we're all kind of interested in seeing what we can do here in the new year     
1:08:14     
so me go to the sort of things that are re happening this week so as you may     
1:08:20     
remember NPS happens in December so nups is coming up this week     
1:08:27     
um starting I think Tuesday and they have usually have a nice online component to that uh I think     
1:08:35     
they're in Vancouver this year so that's the physical location and then they have     
1:08:40     
their online components I know they're going to be on Blue Sky for example I know that they had said that they do     
1:08:47     
that they're will be on YouTube with their videos so why don't we     
1:08:55     
so I've got the nurbs uh site pulled up this is uh for this     
1:09:02     
year it's uh yeah Vancouver Convention Center Tuesday through     
1:09:08     
Sunday uh and so yeah this is the so they have a they actually had this paper     
1:09:15     
visualization with the main conference papers so this actually is sort of a map     
1:09:21     
of all the papers this year's NPS so they have uh you know these papers and     
1:09:27     
blue the blue dots and they're in these different spaces that overlap so you have large language models here in this     
1:09:34     
box you have speech which overlaps with that you have multimodal large language     
1:09:40     
models here you have this graph category which is graph M     
1:09:45     
networks Federated learning over here adversary     
1:09:50     
robustness uh Bandits which are of course the um like the one arm Bandits     
1:09:56     
the narm bandits reinforcement learning of course overlaps with that     
1:10:02     
causal bi biology chemistry time series are kind of smaller categories     
1:10:09     
alternative architectures that's really interesting a lot of like Neo inspired stuff there     
1:10:16     
um spiking neur networks uh Dynamic sensorium     
1:10:22     
competition it's interesting uh we're currently Network dynamical systems flexible content G sensory     
1:10:30     
processing EEG EEG to video which is you know where you take neuroimaging data     
1:10:37     
and you try to like decode uh movies with it then uh neural Vision to     
1:10:44     
language so that's all in alternative architectures that overlaps with     
1:10:49     
diffusion which is of course the diffusion techniques 3D reconstruction overlaps with that as well     
1:10:56     
3D pose estimation 3D object detection so you have all these 3D methods then segmentation which then goes back and     
1:11:03     
overlaps of multimodal large language models so that's really interesting some of these categories and how they kind of     
1:11:09     
overlap with one another uh nice nice     
1:11:19     
visualization did you have anything to say about that Morgan or yeah excuse me I     
1:11:28     
I was trying to track down that particular person that I was talking     
1:11:34     
about no I I there's um I was also seeing that there's some um neurom     
1:11:43     
modulation papers that um that is they're talking about in the T Society     
1:11:50     
uh group that we should catch at Nur and um     
1:11:56     
I yeah I I we haven't done our kind of you know what's our top three workshops     
1:12:03     
we'd want to attend if we could it's funny because you     
1:12:09     
know they're they're my wife and daughter are heading up to Vancouver     
1:12:14     
right now but for Taylor Swift not for     
1:12:19     
N I would have liked to justify it as yeah yeah yeah just a bit more     
1:12:25     
overlapping and be like sure I'll [Laughter] go     
1:12:31     
but uh yeah I I was i' said on the organoid     
1:12:39     
intelligence slack that we should be looking for for interesting paper you     
1:12:44     
know some somebody was posting about you know um a recent     
1:12:51     
Hinton I think I think the vector Institute had an event     
1:12:57     
um you know the the vector vector Institute in Toronto had an event that     
1:13:04     
was you know recapping all the cool research at the vector Institute and you     
1:13:10     
know uh and it and it's it's he had     
1:13:16     
something about you know biological intelligence replacing artificial     
1:13:21     
intelligence or something like that and and it you know it was um it was a     
1:13:29     
little like the organoid intelligence paper where it was a little aspirational yeah you know it was just like yeah we     
1:13:35     
could you know you know everybody's focused on the energy demands of of AI right or     
1:13:44     
certainly of artificial Ai and you know and it's just like okay um I you know no     
1:13:54     
no chance is organ intelligence going to be a good a good solution to the energy     
1:14:01     
issues at this point yeah because it's just like in so many other ways you will     
1:14:07     
be demanding much more expensive resources other types of resources yeah right and     
1:14:16     
and um so uh you know I I was just saying     
1:14:23     
that like as as cool as it is and I I do think that it's um you know we we always     
1:14:30     
see certain things right like I I always want to see who are the developmental psychologists that are going to be     
1:14:36     
speaking in NS right um     
1:14:41     
uh for for you know that that that would be one right and then     
1:14:47     
yeah a number of kind of subtopics like you know um machine learning of of     
1:14:55     
Medical Imaging or you know again like like we we we should you know we can     
1:15:02     
find our favorite you know Workshop or something that's going on there too yeah     
1:15:08     
all right um but you know at the same time like the people who     
1:15:14     
are excuse me fine-tuning language models or things like that like not not     
1:15:19     
really of Interest or you know like that's more yeah um     
1:15:25     
that's more just conventional AI work right yeah or what what people are     
1:15:32     
calling and and yeah um     
1:15:38     
so I I was just saying like where where exactly what conferences would we draw     
1:15:45     
from yeah you know and and     
1:15:52     
again it's it's it's one thing you know like some a topic like organoid     
1:15:57     
intelligence like there's there's probably not a conference at this point but they it would be you know little     
1:16:04     
bits that were brought up at something right yeah so I was pointing out that     
1:16:10     
Cold Spring Harbor has a meeting that's that's next week as well I think it's     
1:16:16     
it's also like 9th to the 12th where it's 3D it's 3D brain     
1:16:23     
development and and organized right and of course not everything that     
1:16:29     
is not everything at a meeting like that is necessarily relevant either right     
1:16:36     
because these are you know we're not trying to do brain science you're trying     
1:16:42     
to get you're trying to do um biological conversational     
1:16:50     
processing you know and then and then transfer it back to a computer yeah     
1:16:56     
right so I you know as an attempt to get you     
1:17:05     
know as an example of something I was actually pointing to the announcements     
1:17:10     
recent announcements from science. XYZ which is this or you know science Corp     
1:17:18     
um uh here in in the Bay Area in Alam which is um max Hoda who was one of the     
1:17:26     
co-founders of neur lincol and um like like most of them have have     
1:17:32     
left and he's focused on these biohybrids electrides     
1:17:38     
right and at least there you're you're thinking a lot about     
1:17:44     
interface uh um you're thinking a lot about     
1:17:50     
um you know you're thinking about material design of the electrides and     
1:17:55     
and and certainly of like Nano um Nano     
1:18:00     
fabrication and you're thinking about very fine control of biology the     
1:18:06     
cellular biology and they've got a they've got a     
1:18:13     
an archive paper right now um and yeah I     
1:18:18     
mean if if if it's of Interest I I can um put the put the whole bunch of links     
1:18:25     
together because there's a nice there's a nice uh video they they brought a film     
1:18:31     
team in as well to to science science court and     
1:18:37     
covered covered what they were doing     
1:18:43     
um yeah so yeah that would be good yeah but I I I I think um you know I I     
1:18:52     
would certainly be looking at nurs for you know like computational Psychiatry     
1:18:58     
relevant papers for yeah right like like hopefully but you know it's it's like     
1:19:05     
perhaps even ones that are specifically focused on you know modeling beh right     
1:19:12     
right right so yeah that's and so if we go back to the visualization this is for     
1:19:18     
posters so like you know this this classification it's useful I don't know if they have it for I don't think they     
1:19:24     
have it for p papers but anyways that's one thing and then of course uh we also wanted to get to the     
1:19:31     
posters or we wanted to get to the workshops and to the uh let's see where     
1:19:37     
are we here uh we have I have okay we have the schedule probably don't     
1:19:43     
have to go through that right now tutorials and workshops is what I wanted to get to so the tutorials are here uh     
1:19:50     
so we have you know things on large language models causality     
1:19:55     
evaluation we have language model pipelines of course there's a lot of this sort of stuff with language models     
1:20:03     
there's flow matching for generative modeling which is interesting um this     
1:20:10     
is abstract okay uh flow matching is a simple yet effective generative modeling     
1:20:16     
Paradigm is inspired by efficient training of diffusion models but offers a similar perspective and enables easy     
1:20:23     
implementation in general ation so flow matching is basically regressing onto     
1:20:29     
conditional velocities so you're using it diffusion models you're modeling sort of the physics you're modeling     
1:20:36     
velocities uh you regress under conditional velocities that generates single data examples and the result is a     
1:20:43     
model that generates the full distribution so this is where they kind of go into this is pretty a heavy sort     
1:20:50     
of math and physics approach to um this sort of model um I guess a machine     
1:20:57     
learning model uh you can adapt this to non-u and geometries build arbitrary markof     
1:21:05     
processes um Etc so that's that's an interesting new sort of newish Technique     
1:21:11     
we have privacy uh experimental design and Analysis for AI researchers that's kind     
1:21:17     
of a newer area I didn't you know but this is still important to kind of figure out how to design experiments for     
1:21:24     
things in you know especially like not just benchmarking but some of these other uh     
1:21:29     
areas where you're kind of interfacing with scientific um you know experiments and     
1:21:36     
Discovery uh advancing data selection for foundation models cross disciplinary insights into     
1:21:43     
alignment in humans and machines um generating programmatic     
1:21:48     
Solutions algorithms and applications of programmatic reinforcement learning and code generation     
1:21:55     
um some Auto distribution uh stuff in a tutorial here     
1:22:01     
where you know they talk about how we can use different techniques to like um     
1:22:08     
you know to to get around some of these aod distribution problems so as as     
1:22:14     
models grow in size and grow in scope they end up encountering these out of distribution     
1:22:20     
behaviors so that's something um to keep an eye on uh meta generation     
1:22:27     
algorithms and this one sandbox for the blackbox a large language models are inst structur data so those are the     
1:22:35     
tutorials then the workshops are um you know we have New Frontiers and     
1:22:40     
adversarial machine learning have mathematical reasoning in AI language     
1:22:46     
gamification sounds interesting statistical Frontiers and large language models and Foundation     
1:22:53     
models um AI for Accelerated materials design     
1:22:59     
AI driven speech Music and Sound generation attributing Model Behavior of     
1:23:05     
scale which is sounds interesting but basically it talks about     
1:23:11     
how so we we don't fully understand how the composition of training data sets     
1:23:16     
influences Model Behavior how to attribute capabilities to some components and which algorithmic choices     
1:23:23     
really Dy performance so this is what we call Model Behavior attribution and they kind of talk about     
1:23:30     
that here um we have unifying representations and     
1:23:35     
neural models table representation learning I'm not sure what that     
1:23:41     
is um tables are a promising modality for representation learning and generative     
1:23:48     
models of too much application potential to ignore so this is tables like you'd find in a CSV file or a tabular file     
1:23:56     
format so it's interesting that they're talking about tables at nurs but that's     
1:24:03     
what they're doing here so there are a lot of things you can do with tables of course you can take text Data out of     
1:24:08     
tables and the other things having to do with training sets um that's interesting     
1:24:17     
um well they have a neuro AI Workshop using neuroscience and AI yeah yeah um     
1:24:24     
Gil Vara not if I'm pronouncing his name right but anyway has projects     
1:24:31     
specifically focused on data table um issues and and you know they've     
1:24:37     
got a new company probable this seems to be like a kind of commercialization of     
1:24:43     
Sait learn okay it's like I think the court D AIT learn we're like we we     
1:24:50     
deserve to get paid yeah anyway so you'll     
1:24:57     
[Music] see probable got videos out and they     
1:25:03     
they seem to have you know a bit of a but but talk a lot about data tables I     
1:25:08     
don't know why I I I was just assuming that it's a lot of times that people have data Tes well yeah most people who     
1:25:16     
attend the workshop want to like you know like isn't that how everybody has their data structured right yeah anyway     
1:25:23     
it just seems like like that was you know our like our like 30 years ago     
1:25:31     
right right you know you got your data table well yeah it's it's a very practical problem it's like I have data     
1:25:38     
here how do I get it out right right it's it's like it's like a n's workshop     
1:25:43     
on on doing statistics [Laughter] yeah yeah I don't see yeah I don't see     
1:25:51     
anything specific to like competition Psychiatry or even like behavioral stuff     
1:25:57     
uh well you know like workshop on behavioral machine learning like who's     
1:26:03     
that I mean some of these like I I I     
1:26:08     
wonder like yeah I don't recognize any of these people I mean it doesn't you know     
1:26:14     
like yeah do they gonna say who     
1:26:19     
we yeah I think a lot of this is like     
1:26:25     
it's it's also funny because I mean again like this is the this is the     
1:26:31     
conference where I met my advisor okay or the person who ended up being my advisor and um this is such you know     
1:26:41     
that was that was like 20 years ago right and um and you know look how many     
1:26:50     
of those workshops seem like super focused on either generating large language models or dealing with internet     
1:26:57     
scale data yeah or or like or internet data right like     
1:27:03     
yeah it's definitely shifted I think since 20 year from 20 years ago used to     
1:27:09     
be more you know still these will be all like absolutely excellent you know     
1:27:16     
technical presentations right yeah um I mean sure     
1:27:22     
um uh so yeah yeah learning in the physical     
1:27:29     
sciences Foundation models for     
1:27:36     
science but you know I mean I've I've I've liked     
1:27:42     
those um they they depending on who's putting it     
1:27:49     
together um it seems like they have a bit of a focus on or some of them might     
1:27:57     
have a focus on kind of like these like physics inspired neural networks     
1:28:02     
yeah um or physics informed um and     
1:28:10     
um I mean what about the scientific methods for for neural networks up just     
1:28:16     
a a row yeah scient scientific meth for understanding neural networks yeah like     
1:28:22     
What's um looks like basically while deep learning     
1:28:27     
continues to achieve impressive results understanding of the principles underlying their successes remain     
1:28:33     
largely limited this is because we're approaching it from a mathematical point     
1:28:38     
of view and then they want to promote a complimentary approach that is centered     
1:28:44     
on the use of the scientific method so hypotheses and controlled experiments to     
1:28:49     
look at like it's basically testing alternate deep or machine learning     
1:28:55     
models uh the empirical analysis of deep networks uh which you can falsify     
1:29:02     
existing theories or answer questions about the success or failure of the models they don't say like I guess they     
1:29:08     
have a workshop website which is maybe a little bit more insightful uh I don't know if you know     
1:29:15     
any of these people oh s ganguli oh yeah okay yep thank you and who else I don't     
1:29:22     
see anyone yeah I mean Andrew saxs um so but I would be hard pressed I mean     
1:29:30     
guli I can tell you about the kind of work I I can't think of what saxon's work is focused on yeah but but yeah so     
1:29:40     
recognize the name yeah yeah yeah right and I guess debunking challenge which is     
1:29:45     
like the we host the challenge to interrogate commonly held beliefs in the Deep learning community so they want to     
1:29:52     
debunk a lot of the like uh that's funny yeah so that's yeah that's     
1:29:59     
uh like you know they're doing a lot of interesting things I don't see anything in like uh Psychiatry or psychology I do     
1:30:08     
see stuff with uh biology no I I was I was wondering though about you know     
1:30:14     
something like you know I don't know if if um     
1:30:24     
I mean you know causal representation     
1:30:29     
learning I mean I'm just looking at a little bit you know open world agents     
1:30:36     
down there open world yeah yeah second the     
1:30:43     
down on the bottom yeah and then two in oh this one here yeah workshop on open     
1:30:50     
world agents yeah that is uh yeah so this is superhuman     
1:30:58     
performance uh open world environman is the new habitat for EI agents Highway     
1:31:05     
diverse and dynamic fully interactive teaming up with infinite and creative tasks and requiring continuing learning     
1:31:12     
or continual learning and growth so open agents it's kind of like World models     
1:31:18     
maybe yeah yeah I mean but you know I I you know     
1:31:24     
definitely like the open in the sense of of like open-ended yeah yeah um you know     
1:31:32     
potentially that's something um     
1:31:38     
again that's the you     
1:31:43     
know again it's like what would what would Richard Sutton be looking for in this conference     
1:31:51     
yeah he's like you know we we've already said     
1:31:56     
what would what would Daniel fredman do right right you know it's yeah so Daniel     
1:32:02     
fredman and Rich Sutton got it uh who the who are the other good people that     
1:32:07     
you ask hypothetically on what they would do because they're plenty they're plenty yeah yeah yeah absolutely you     
1:32:15     
know I mean so I mean I was I was already just talking about like     
1:32:20     
y um you know like like who who are the     
1:32:25     
Yan Lon what's his Lon Yan Lon well he's     
1:32:31     
you know he's engaged in in um he's     
1:32:37     
building these these internet Scale Models right so he's got he's got you     
1:32:44     
know hundreds of engineering challenges that he's thinking about okay that are     
1:32:50     
are are are all real you like they're all real challenges but they're not necessarily like of interest to     
1:32:57     
conversational Psychiatry people you know I'm just wondering like what are what are the compensational     
1:33:02     
psychiatrists looking for in this meting like what what are the kind of the the     
1:33:08     
yeah like the sub topics that would be of interest to them or would solve solve     
1:33:13     
problems that they're thinking about yeah yeah interest interesting stuff interesting stuff and um you know I     
1:33:20     
appreciate that I appreciate that um I always uh imagined uh you know sorry I didn't mean to get     
1:33:25     
digressive but it's it's like yeah in terms of of other     
1:33:32     
people oh I mean I mean more so like I'm not even just like speaking like figuratively here like on on some on     
1:33:38     
some level you have to imagine these researchers and their approachers and what they would have been looking for when they were publishing this one you     
1:33:44     
know so asking a question for example what would Freedman think what would Freedman do that's what it really comes down to so yeah yeah right     
1:33:52     
right yeah uh I one that I saw in here was uh the     
1:33:57     
systems to system to reasoning at scale I don't know if this is like this is kind of closer to uh thinking about the     
1:34:06     
brain although it's not like any sort of Neuroscience it's just kind of like system 2 from you know Mar system or     
1:34:13     
well it's not Mar but it's the I think uh can't remember who proposed system     
1:34:19     
one and system two is this like Canon yeah yeah yeah Canon yeah right so this is system two which     
1:34:27     
is the sort of the the reflection and thinking uh thinking slow yeah thinking     
1:34:34     
slow so this is our Workshop focuses on improving reasoning in neural networks     
1:34:40     
you achieving system to reasoning and Transformer like models the workshop addresses issues like distinguishing     
1:34:47     
memorization from R based learning understanding syntactic generalization     
1:34:52     
and composition those are typical problems you encounter     
1:34:57     
in sort of you know kind of this reasoning or long-term planning and     
1:35:03     
things like that uh the workshop also covers the importance of understanding how systematic models or incisions for     
1:35:10     
AI safety integrating neural networks with symbolic reasoning and developing new architectures or enhanced reasoning     
1:35:18     
capabilities um yeah that's that's uh one one of approach to     
1:35:25     
that um yeah and so yeah they have like multimodal algorithmic reasoning they     
1:35:31     
have compositional learning uh uh let's see any     
1:35:38     
others intrinsically motivated open-ended learning which looks interesting uh from the standpoint of     
1:35:45     
like open-endedness so yeah this is I don't know if their website is a little bit     
1:35:51     
more okay there we go um uh this is just kind of how do we as humans develop     
1:35:57     
Broad and flexible repertoir of Knowledge and Skills how can we design autonomous Life Learning machines with     
1:36:04     
the same abilities so this is based on like intrinsic motivated learning or     
1:36:10     
curiosity driven learning this is uh odier pierier in     
1:36:16     
France um at the flowers uh lab and Schmid Huber of course is cited     
1:36:22     
here uh yeah so it's this intrinsic motivation intrinsic drives have evolved     
1:36:28     
in animals to drive exploratory behaviors and essential component of efficient     
1:36:33     
learning uh who's running this one I wonder uh     
1:36:38     
organizers this is yeah Brendan Lake actually who     
1:36:45     
published really interesting papers on yeah uh Pierre Yoder yeah Daniel sure     
1:36:54     
yeah a lot of people from that kind of space of like they're doing kind of     
1:36:59     
quazi Developmental stuff developmental stuff yeah certainly thinking about     
1:37:05     
thinking about yeah animal behavior Behavior modeling yeah yeah     
1:37:10     
that's cool okay so I mean you know I'm I think we I think this is you know kind     
1:37:18     
of a nice overview I mean there's so much at NS that you can do there are a lot of papers on I'm not going to get     
1:37:24     
into you know you can go to the schedule to find that uh but yeah maybe we can uh     
1:37:30     
I don't know if people want to look through the schedule and find something it's really interesting we can talk about it because they usually publish     
1:37:36     
all the papers on archive they're accessible and I was I was saying how     
1:37:43     
embarrassing it is right that that Cold Spring Harbor is has got a meeting like     
1:37:49     
exactly the same time yeah and and it's the ABS abolute opposite of     
1:37:56     
of you know open on openness like transparency you know everything it's     
1:38:04     
the opposite you know yeah they they give you they give you the the titles of     
1:38:11     
posters and and that's it yeah just yeah come to the meeting title title at first     
1:38:18     
author and and and no transparent you know like no like these were you know     
1:38:26     
here's the reviews that that the you know like how did these posters get     
1:38:32     
selected yeah you know and and um how much of     
1:38:38     
this is going to be recorded and how much of this you know are these posters going to be be available before I like     
1:38:45     
opposite anyway yeah it's um I I I hope we all take a page from these ml     
1:38:52     
conferences term there open this yeah the the bio well bio conference is usual     
1:38:59     
transparent like ones from the lab like from Cold Spring Harbor is really hard to decipher sometimes like it's going on     
1:39:06     
well yeah yeah I mean I they sometimes I think they they run it like it's a     
1:39:13     
business you know like like you know like sure if you pay     
1:39:18     
$800 you know you can yeah anyway well you're collects their fee too it's not     
1:39:25     
yeah but yeah okay so yeah that's good so I wanted to kind of finish up here with we     
1:39:32     
go back to the narrow AI stuff we were talking about um last time uh so I did a     
1:39:40     
overview of narrow AI it was like two weeks ago now and uh I wanted to kind of go through a little bit more followup on     
1:39:47     
that so there is this uh this was published in the transmitter which is this blog or     
1:39:55     
or Magazine online of it's very much Neuroscience oriented this it's the new     
1:40:01     
Quant yeah new quanta yeah so this is Anthony zidor who's done a lot of stuff     
1:40:07     
in computational Neuroscience uh and he's using a neuro     
1:40:13     
AI here so neuro AI a field born from the symbiosis between neuroscience and     
1:40:19     
AI so this is his take on this is history of this nent discipline reveals     
1:40:25     
neurosciences inspired advances and artificial intelligence and AI in turn is provided     
1:40:31     
a testing ground for models and Neuroscience accelerating progress in both Fields so that's one thing we don't     
1:40:37     
have in the neurs conference yet we may have this in the future is this sort of     
1:40:44     
how our you know how is sort of AI providing a testing grer models of Neuroscience     
1:40:51     
it's interesting because when you talk within neuro AI a lot of people let a     
1:40:56     
neuroscientists are skeptical of what AI has to offer neuroscience and I don't know if that's     
1:41:02     
just kind of like biological snobbery which is not a term but I just made it up or if it's like there really isn't     
1:41:10     
that much Insight um but it's interesting because like AI people have     
1:41:15     
no problem taking things from the brain but maybe it's seen as like you know computational models are seen as kind of     
1:41:22     
like you know crackpots sort of theories and you know     
1:41:28     
yeah there's a view maybe that it's not empirical and some so that's that's kind     
1:41:33     
of how I've just noticed that sort of take on it so he you know he's he's kind     
1:41:39     
of giving his view with nuro AI you can actually listen to it if you want instead of reading it um that's that's a     
1:41:47     
cool feature well anyways uh so neuro AI which is this port Mano between     
1:41:52     
neuroscience science and Ai and of course we know that that relationship is bidirectional but not equal     
1:41:59     
necessarily um we talk he talks about the brain initiative which we talked about in our recap of the uh Naro AI     
1:42:08     
workshop and so they're going to have a whole series of essays on noi here so     
1:42:13     
we'll maybe come back to those later uh you talks about the co-evolution of AI and Neuroscience and     
1:42:20     
the ongoing symbiosis between these fields then have created and continues the form a virtuous     
1:42:27     
cycle so first it relates the application of AI to Neuroscience specifically the use of     
1:42:33     
neural networks as computational models of the brain which offer a concrete and rigorous way to test otherwise     
1:42:39     
potentially fuzzy hypotheses of how collections of neurons compute and you     
1:42:45     
know this this goes back to this thing as talking about where some neuroscientists don't feel that AI has     
1:42:51     
as much utility as AI people think Neuroscience has and you know if you     
1:42:57     
think about like how we've applied these computational models to the brain you     
1:43:02     
know think about what cognitive science was doing maybe 40 years ago or 30 years ago where that's how sort of     
1:43:10     
connectionist models got started and got famous was they're applying those     
1:43:15     
connectionist models to cognition so like you know a lot of people would uh there was like a burst     
1:43:22     
of papers in that era in the 80s and 90s where people would take connectionist     
1:43:28     
models and model things in the brain model cognition in the brain so it's not just you know questions about     
1:43:34     
neuroanatomy it's like the mind which is being modeled in this way and of course people stopped doing that after a while     
1:43:41     
because it was maybe of limited utility but uh I don't know the his full history     
1:43:47     
of like that burst of papers where people were apply connectionism to     
1:43:52     
cognition but it'd be interesting to go back to that and look at what actually kind of happened you know did people     
1:43:59     
stop doing because it fell out of fashion or because it was not really giving good answers or what yeah I I I     
1:44:06     
you know I think it's when it's around the time when things like actar and sore     
1:44:12     
and and other you know other models kind of made their first you know hit the     
1:44:19     
scene first um uh uh uh     
1:44:26     
yeah yeah yeah and it was yeah I mean it was kind of that was     
1:44:33     
early computational cognitive science yeah right     
1:44:40     
um uh but um yeah it would     
1:44:46     
be uh and that's you know again like we don't you know like I don't see a     
1:44:55     
section on that that Nerfs yeah yeah right yeah that would be maybe something     
1:45:02     
more for Co the Cog ey conference but I don't think they cover that either I think and and there is there is now a     
1:45:09     
great computational cognitive science uh um conference now right so like like     
1:45:17     
that is a that is a that is a thing anyway sor     
1:45:23     
yeah it's it's I I it does kind of go both ways though right I mean you know I     
1:45:29     
remember when when Tony Zer had the he was the     
1:45:35     
first author on this on this paper that was kind of a the first neuro AI kind of     
1:45:42     
white paper yeah remember this yeah and and um     
1:45:49     
um you know and there were these like Deep Mind be people being like this is     
1:45:54     
silly you know we're not we're not taking anything you know we're not taking anything from nuro right yeah     
1:46:01     
well yeah they a purist in that direction too yeah you know and and yeah     
1:46:07     
yeah that that's if anything you know like you know it's we're     
1:46:15     
we're we're taking things from physics yeah you know and and     
1:46:23     
occasionally giving giving um giving it a narrative that that talks about what     
1:46:30     
it's inspired by yeah yeah but but but this is you     
1:46:35     
know it's more akin to like condensed matter     
1:46:41     
physics anyway yeah best giving life to your precious     
1:46:47     
Neuroscience right right New Life yeah uh is articul by Richard fineman's     
1:46:54     
famous dictum that which I cannot create I do not understand and so we can maybe     
1:46:59     
create networks that give us some information about how the brain performs     
1:47:04     
computations and then neuroi refers to the adaptation of insights or Neuroscience build better AI systems so     
1:47:12     
we want to build artificial systems that can do things a human can do and you know those two research     
1:47:19     
programs are kind of what we want to talk in ideal age form this reinforcing     
1:47:24     
feedback loop that accelerates progress in both Fields so there's this     
1:47:30     
uh uh so yeah it can also be used to find structure and large Neuroscience data sets so this deep lab cut     
1:47:38     
program which is from the McKenzie mathys lab enables researchers to     
1:47:43     
automatically track animal movements those are just you know it's just one example of how you this symbiosis     
1:47:49     
Works um and so he kind of goes to history of computing and how there's     
1:47:54     
always been this interest in approximating biology if you go back to heavan learning or the pit of Mulla     
1:48:02     
neuron Rosen blats work on a perceptron these are all just kind of like you know     
1:48:08     
either uh analogies from biology or you're talking about some sort of electronic brain or something like that     
1:48:16     
the perceptron of course being a perception based machine and then you know this idea here     
1:48:24     
Marvin Minsky and seamart Pepper's 1969 book chapter perceptrons is exposed the     
1:48:30     
limitations of single layer perceptrons and triggered the first neural network winter the core Neuroscience inspired     
1:48:37     
idea that synapses are the plastic elements or free parameters of a neural network has remained absolutely Central     
1:48:44     
to Modern AI so this is where you know we the whole kind of the core of what     
1:48:52     
modern AI is is based on the synapse and sort of analogy of the synapse how do we     
1:48:58     
model that rather than like you know neurons interacting the weights of those     
1:49:05     
interactions are actually like analogous to synapses that's kind of what he's getting it here so I mean you know that     
1:49:13     
they're very broad analogies and of course that's where we can bring in a lot of neuro inspired stuff aside from     
1:49:20     
like this neuro relationship kind of working out models of the the biology of     
1:49:27     
these components yeah you know everybody     
1:49:33     
should everybody should read Grace Lindsay's book yeah I     
1:49:39     
know it's it's absolutely worthwhile covering covering all that in depth     
1:49:46     
yeah yeah so and then you know this kind of talks about how there were     
1:49:52     
discoveries in science that kind of parallel some of the things going on in AI of course those are you know maybe uh     
1:50:00     
you know again their analogies they're not really like approximating like for     
1:50:06     
example convolutional neuron networks we inspired by Hil and wisel's model of     
1:50:12     
visual cortex but you know what is it what is it really is it doing something similar or is it really kind of     
1:50:19     
capturing what happens in the visual cortex is really kind of an open question and you know there maybe you     
1:50:26     
know if we had more experimental methods we could get at that question more directly but there does seem to be some     
1:50:33     
some really interesting overlap between yeah what the brain's doing and and these system yeah definitely yeah and     
1:50:42     
and and you know because because Free's books I mean he he he draws a lot um     
1:50:50     
from from these those moment models in his visual visual     
1:50:58     
processing text um and so so I saw I saw     
1:51:03     
you know I got those presentations before you know image net and things like that and and it was it was really     
1:51:12     
you know I think it was the parallels were pretty striking yeah yeah um I I I     
1:51:21     
it's the next paragraph that I take some on bridge bridge with well it's this one     
1:51:27     
here yeah yeah so this is uh another home run in the story of reinforcement     
1:51:33     
learning uh is the game playing engine Alpha zero more recently the concept of     
1:51:38     
Dropout is gain prominence in artificial neural networks this technique in which individual neurons in the artificial     
1:51:44     
Network are randomly deactivated during training to prevent overfitting draws     
1:51:50     
inspiration this is again inspiration and the brains use to stochastic processes which are yeah you know     
1:51:58     
multitude but yeah they didn't they didn't they didn't draw     
1:52:06     
inspiration they were they were trying to make their their models work right     
1:52:11     
right right like like like if there was inspiration it was they were inspired to     
1:52:19     
to try and tell a story afterwards post talk explanation for why why this     
1:52:26     
why this makes sense it doesn't look like they're just fiddling with KN yeah     
1:52:32     
right because it's like you know again if you if you remember it's funny I I     
1:52:38     
remember 2016 yeah it wasn't that long ago like it wasn't that long ago right but     
1:52:46     
uh you know I mean you know pre pre 2016 um you know so we're talking about     
1:52:53     
between 2012 and 2016 a little time and and it was this     
1:53:00     
thing where it was just like hey you know don't just keep it running     
1:53:06     
you want to you you want to stop the training early     
1:53:13     
right right like like why wouldn't you just let it run yeah you know and and it     
1:53:20     
was it was just this overfitting problem like which which again like widely known     
1:53:27     
in neural you know as being a neural network problem right right and um     
1:53:35     
so yeah like to say that it has anything to do with like synaptic     
1:53:42     
Fring you know it's it's and I bet I bet you could     
1:53:49     
have a a a completely energy based t uh um you know a a um kind of like     
1:53:59     
simulated a kneeling story where it's like it's just a     
1:54:06     
physics story for why you want to do this yeah you could no no no Brain     
1:54:13     
Analogy needed required yeah you know like     
1:54:18     
yeah so yeah by mimicking the occasional misp neurons and you know kind of brings     
1:54:24     
up also if you go to uh biologic like     
1:54:29     
computation yeah yeah yeah like stick with one story what is this so This     
1:54:36     
brings up a point about like what people are doing in computational biology which is like they're trying to not build     
1:54:43     
models uh like neural network models but they're trying to approximate the process that's going on in in the     
1:54:50     
different biological systems so if you're going to model stochastic processes in biological systems they're     
1:54:56     
techniques that people use in in computational biology and they actually try to fit that to the data you know and     
1:55:04     
and of course you know you you you run the risk in that kind of Enterprise of like picking the wrong mechanism or you     
1:55:11     
know using a mathematical tool that doesn't necessarily map to what the nervous system is doing so you know yeah     
1:55:18     
you're right about like stochastic processes are stochastic processes     
1:55:23     
it's a random process that you could model with like some variance term in a     
1:55:28     
in a differential equation or model it with some sort of random walk or something like that and it isn't     
1:55:35     
necessarily dropping out neurons although if you drop a node out of a network it has an effect on the network     
1:55:42     
and how information moves through the network that's not necessarily the same     
1:55:47     
thing so like if you we don't want to collapse too many things into sort of an explanation or collapse too many     
1:55:55     
explanations into into doing some sort of technique yeah yeah I I I I find that     
1:56:02     
that particular paragraph uh incoherent oh yeah you know it's like it's like I I     
1:56:11     
think he's gonna start talking about reinforcement learning and then it's talking about     
1:56:16     
training talking about about misfiring it's just like I I i' I've completely     
1:56:23     
lost what the what the Yeah but still good it's still good     
1:56:29     
yeah yeah it is and you know this I think highlights some of the issues in neuro AI which is that yes you know when     
1:56:36     
we take like a complex system like the brain we're just trying to find a representation of what it's doing or the     
1:56:44     
Dynamics especially and it's that's the whole Enterprise is finding the right     
1:56:50     
parts that mean the most explain those variants absolutely right I mean it's a     
1:56:56     
it's a classic CA case of you know you don't want the map to to equal the territory right yeah right and and so     
1:57:05     
yeah yeah but um you know stick with one pen I     
1:57:13     
don't I'm trying to think of the editing advice what uh yeah yeah so I mean this     
1:57:21     
and and goes through a couple more examples here so that's the whole article pretty much um and it of course     
1:57:28     
there are some uh practical and ethical issues that really need to be explored     
1:57:33     
you know we talked about these last time uh of course that's an incomplete list but there are whole host of open     
1:57:39     
questions in Nei that we can look to did did you     
1:57:45     
already cover um Patrick minal's uh um neuro AI for     
1:57:52     
safety paper I don't I don't think we've covered that yeah that's something very     
1:58:00     
yeah highly recommend it okay you know     
1:58:06     
not well you know to to to take my own advice and stick with the map metaphor     
1:58:12     
you know the um uh     
1:58:18     
uh you're going to need a big map yeah you need a bigger     
1:58:25     
mat the the famous Jaws we need a bigger boat right     
1:58:32     
um You Know You're gonna talk about the brain like get a get a comfy chair right     
1:58:39     
right it's it's gonna take a while you can't it's not a biy tweet and and um so     
1:58:50     
he yeah I mean I I think maybe you know again this is this is a very short     
1:58:55     
article for Simon Foundation to you know popularize you know to do science     
1:59:02     
communication right so yeah Patrick manal's uh paper I mean     
1:59:08     
he's just first author with a bunch of people but but they're really trying to cover a a lot of of     
1:59:17     
areas in depth and and then say like hey you     
1:59:24     
know yeah St studying the brain requires using MLA aai whatever you want to call     
1:59:31     
it yeah and and you know that that     
1:59:36     
there's just there's lots of loopiness right you know and and there's lots of     
1:59:42     
scales that things are happening at and um um and he he just tries to do a real     
1:59:50     
overview of of a lot of them that I thought was really was really helpful in kind of of showing you where the     
2:00:00     
frontier areas were I thought it was good and and yeah     
2:00:07     
um I'd be happy to um uh this U this guy     
2:00:13     
from that that just came out of Mark W which's lab and Oxford moved to over to     
2:00:19     
to Oakland Berkeley and um he was the first one poed me to it was just like     
2:00:25     
hey we should spend time on this and um uh he I'm gonna I'm gonna take off     
2:00:32     
pretty soon and go to the the foresight Vision weekend okay oh good and and you     
2:00:39     
know like Conrad gording and um some people off that I think that first Nur     
2:00:45     
AI paper are gonna be there okay wow all right yeah yeah yeah and um anyway but     
2:00:53     
that that would be yeah that would be a cool um I think a a cool one to cover     
2:01:00     
and I I I actually posted that paper on the organoid intelligence slack okay     
2:01:07     
saying you know because I was just like like you know hden doesn't have anything     
2:01:13     
to say about organized you know like brilliant Nobel     
2:01:20     
Prize winner you know not not his thing yeah um and you know     
2:01:28     
uh yeah like like I I think     
2:01:33     
um yeah all right I'll stop there all right yeah and I'll I'll continue on and     
2:01:39     
and you know if you need to go it's okay it'll be on the recording so yeah so we     
2:01:45     
talked about this uh is this the paper okay we talked about this transmitter     
2:01:51     
paper um I have a screenshot from last time     
2:01:56     
you know I had these screenshots that were from the session at the NIH and this is uh so this is from this paper     
2:02:04     
Amon this is Brad Amon is the person who I'm going to talk about his paper in a     
2:02:09     
minute but this is uh called a road map for reaching the potential brain derived Computing so this is published in     
2:02:16     
advanced intelligence systems and so this is an uh like a a a road map that     
2:02:22     
he developed so this is the evolution of artificial intelligence since behaviorism so this is back when we had     
2:02:30     
uh you know Psychology was dominated by behaviorism and of course behaviorism provided the uh inspiration for     
2:02:37     
reinforcement learning and this was before the cognitive Revolution so this is really interesting how he links sort     
2:02:45     
of artificial intelligence and of course the early years of artificial intelligence with behaviorism which of     
2:02:51     
course set the time was the predominant psychological theory or psychological     
2:02:57     
approach so if we go back to like pre-1940 we have people like pavlof     
2:03:03     
Skinner um baderin and Hall and these are all studies Behavior studies that     
2:03:09     
kind of focused on learning and then there was this sort of     
2:03:14     
inspiration from that world from at the time Neuroscience which was a lot of     
2:03:20     
neuroanatomy and trying localize things and of course we had Behavioral Studies     
2:03:26     
like Pavlov and Skinner and things like that and this feeds into a couple of areas so artificial neural Nets     
2:03:34     
statistical machine learning and dynamical machine learning and so artificial neural Nets of course then     
2:03:40     
were inspired by this pre-1940 work resulting in the Mulla and Pitts     
2:03:46     
work in 1943 when they uh you know they proposed this biophysically in fired neuron and so     
2:03:55     
that leads to the perceptron of Rosen blat in 1958 and of course then that was sort of     
2:04:01     
discussed as having limitations in the 60s and that led to an AI     
2:04:07     
winter uh you then had further development in uh statistical machine     
2:04:12     
learning where a lot of the ideas from behaviorism led to the decision trees of     
2:04:18     
hunt and then in dynamical machine learning and the GRE enforcement learning first proposed by Minsky in     
2:04:24     
1961 so that reinforcement learning actually goes back to Minsky uh early     
2:04:30     
versions of it and then Sutton popular as later versions of it um then you have     
2:04:38     
things from 1940 to 1960 so you have HEBs work in 1949 and that was of course um heavan     
2:04:46     
learning which it focuses on the synapse hble and wisel's work in 1959 and then     
2:04:51     
focused on on neuron neuronal representations and that leads us to the Fukushima work of 1975 which is the     
2:04:59     
cognet Tron which then led to the hopefield Nets and it sort of led us down two     
2:05:06     
paths one towards temporal coding and Reservoir Computing and population     
2:05:12     
representations and another path characterized by lon's work and deep     
2:05:18     
learning of Hinton and and other group people as well Schmid hubber is in there     
2:05:24     
as well so we have this sort of artificial neural Nets uh trajectory     
2:05:30     
then we have the statistical machine learning trajectory which is where we had from from decision trees we went to     
2:05:36     
basy and Nets Judea pearls work on that basy and Nets and     
2:05:42     
causality um a support Vector machines by Cortez     
2:05:47     
and vapnik in the 9s and then random forests in 2001 and it continues on so     
2:05:53     
we have the statistical approaches to machine learning inspired actually by the behaviorists and then the dynamical     
2:06:00     
machine learning so reinforcement learning uh the reinforcement learning of Minsky markof models proposed by     
2:06:07     
rabner in 1989 Sutton proposes you know an updated version reinforcement     
2:06:13     
learning in 1998 we have Dynamic basy and Nets by Murphy in 2002 and on and on and on     
2:06:20     
where we had to move forward through these Dynam using dynamical     
2:06:26     
representations dynamical systems systems that require you to model things     
2:06:31     
as a trans transitions between states and transitions between other types of     
2:06:38     
constructs um over time so you have these three different branches all coming from this     
2:06:44     
pre-1940s behaviorism and then in in Neuroscience of course things are moving on as we go from     
2:06:52     
the work in the 60s work in the 70s work in the 80s and then right around the     
2:06:58     
time of o'keef in 1993 which was of course these stuff on um play cells and     
2:07:04     
and other types of representations in hippocampus we get this temporal coding which is influencing Reservoir Computing     
2:07:12     
we get things in the 2000s population representations which are feeding into artificial neural Nets     
2:07:19     
more and so this is a nice I think I think uh one slide summary of this     
2:07:25     
there's probably more here that we could draw out but this is a nice um you know     
2:07:31     
model of this sort of uh these trajectories so uh this paper here is the paper this     
2:07:39     
comes from this is James animon uh James B animon uh this is an     
2:07:45     
advanced intelligence systems uh so this talks about     
2:07:50     
neuromorphic Computing specifically so uh neuromorphic Computing is a critical     
2:07:56     
future technology for the Computing industry but it is yet to achieve its promise and has struggled to establish a     
2:08:03     
cohesive research Community a large part of the challenge is that full realization of the potential brain     
2:08:10     
inspiration requires advances in both device Hardware Computing architectures and algorithm so it's not just about the     
2:08:17     
software and about like building a network uh that you can represent things on it's actually building the hardware     
2:08:25     
that is more sort of amenable to biological metaphor than the bond Wan     
2:08:32     
architecture which of course isn't necessarily built in any sort of biological metaphor this is where you     
2:08:38     
know where people are building neuron neuromorphic Hardware specifically because you can't     
2:08:45     
necessarily represent what the brain is doing on a Bondo and architecture um um so the simultaneously     
2:08:53     
Development Across technology skills is unprecedented in the Computing field so it prevents a lot of unique challenges     
2:08:59     
this article presents a strategy frame by market and policy pressures removing past these current technological and     
2:09:06     
cultural hurdles to realize its full impact across technology achieving the     
2:09:11     
full potential of brain derived algorithms as well as post complimentary metal oxide semiconductors or seos     
2:09:18     
scaling neuromorphic Hardware requires a proximately balancing the near-term opportunities of deep learning     
2:09:25     
applications with the long-term potential of less understood o opportunities in neural Computing or     
2:09:30     
neural Computing so this kind of goes over the marketplace the technology uh Evolution     
2:09:38     
so basic yeah like like Morgan was saying there's a lot of focus on energy     
2:09:44     
consumption um both in terms of you know the the input data but also the cost of     
2:09:50     
energy consumption so we have this convergence of mors Law and Big Data where mors law is keeping     
2:09:57     
up with the ability to you know where if you get smaller and smaller processors     
2:10:03     
meaning that you have more and more computational capacity you can only make     
2:10:09     
those transistors so small before you run into the limits of of the quantum scale and so that's where you start to     
2:10:17     
have this uh maybe need for a different type of heart     
2:10:22     
and so if we want higher and higher levels of performance we're going to have to move to a different Hardware     
2:10:28     
Paradigm and so you know we've kind of reached more as law in a way already so     
2:10:33     
we we need to kind of investigate some of these new um     
2:10:38     
Technologies and so there is a role for brain inspiration here of course we can     
2:10:44     
look at like how to overcome Wars law through brain inspiration but we have to do that at the hardware level and then     
2:10:50     
of course if we do it at the hardware level we need software to keep up and to take some of the things that we've been     
2:10:56     
doing on on royman architectures and map them to some of these neural U hard you     
2:11:03     
know neural pieces of Hardware but also build software that's more sort of     
2:11:09     
amenable to that neuronal um metaphor so we're doing a lot of things like basian     
2:11:15     
methods and causal graphs can we do these in a neural architecture so we     
2:11:20     
have so okay there's something highlighted here this lack of direct influence of Neuroscience in modern AI     
2:11:27     
represents an opportunity so we should be able to use neuroscience at least to     
2:11:32     
move forward some of our Computing techniques and improve those to build     
2:11:39     
these kind of AI systems so he proposes a road map following five stages one     
2:11:45     
designed flexible low powerered AI implementations using spiking normic Hardware so it's like spiking neural     
2:11:51     
networks but in the hardware as well extend reach of neuro Hardware by     
2:11:57     
designing efficient spiking neur algorithms for one which is this first     
2:12:02     
point so we basically need to design flexible low power implementations but also on the neural     
2:12:10     
Hardware design efficient spiking neuro algorithms the third point is design     
2:12:16     
hybrid analog spiking architectures for biological scale algorithms so we need things that are     
2:12:22     
sort of at the scale with what the brain does instead of like small processing units that are     
2:12:28     
disconnected so we need to focus on building networks maybe at the hardware level but also at the software     
2:12:36     
level uh four achieve powerful more powerful AI capabilities by implementing     
2:12:41     
brain derived neural algorithms and then five look to Exotic Hardware approaches that achieve full     
2:12:47     
neuromorphic capabilities again this is like you know kind of part kind of drawing together the tools that we have     
2:12:54     
and part Visionary so we don't really have all the tools in place now but we have some that we can use that for the     
2:13:02     
inspiration so you know he proposes a couple things he talks about the current state of the neuromorphic hardware     
2:13:08     
Community we have Coss circuits we have different types of logic that we need to     
2:13:14     
use um we really need to do more research to get scalable production     
2:13:20     
systems production suitable systems in place these need to be analog not     
2:13:26     
digital and so we need to kind of figure out how to do that uh it talks about     
2:13:31     
spiking neuromorphic algorithms and this is actually a nice figure showing the relationship between programmable     
2:13:38     
hardware and the algorithms so we have gpus that run deep learning algorithms     
2:13:43     
we can take those deep learning algorithms ort them to spiking neuromorphic chips we can then have     
2:13:50     
spiking algorithms that th approximate networks we can maybe put those in     
2:13:55     
hybrid analog digital neuromorphic chips so the spiking neuromorphic chips would be digital we want to kind of     
2:14:02     
approximate some of the analog features of the brain as well and then we want to have these     
2:14:08     
truly brain deri of algorithms which are maybe spiking algorithms that are     
2:14:13     
inspired by Deep learning algorithms that also include some of these analog processes and other types of processes     
2:14:19     
in the brain and he has a map here of like the hippocampus where you know you have ca1     
2:14:27     
and ca3 the Dente gyus and the aninal cortex so you have spiking neurons     
2:14:34     
within those boxes and then connections between those boxes and then you know     
2:14:39     
that's how we at least have a circuit of the the campus uh we can approximate     
2:14:45     
maybe like one green region in that way and then there are digital processes or     
2:14:50     
analog processes within that Network that operates at different scales and so     
2:14:55     
then you can have these kind of truly brain drived algorithms that then give us this unknown     
2:15:01     
future uh for potential like you know different types of 3D architecture novel     
2:15:07     
types of devices Etc that leverage that uh hard the capability of the hardware     
2:15:13     
and the software AMS so that's what he's talking about     
2:15:18     
here he's talking about things like continuous valued uh neural     
2:15:23     
networks you know things like analog uh computation so these are things that     
2:15:30     
Advan architecture may not be well suited for and so it's hard to really     
2:15:35     
kind of put that out there you know as a as a you know something you can Benchmark but you can look at some of     
2:15:41     
these things and and see how they behave either through simulation or through you     
2:15:47     
know running them on these uh nonscale neuromorphic     
2:15:53     
platforms okay so that then he gives them challenges for spiking neuromorphic Hardware Sim challenges for hybrid     
2:16:00     
animal spiking morphic Hardware uh and then this uh this is a     
2:16:07     
kind of a Cheesy diagram but basically showing this link between neuroscience     
2:16:12     
and Computing where we have this narot transfer of knowledge right now and     
2:16:18     
where we want this highway between the two fields that enables greater knowledge     
2:16:25     
transfer okay so that's that's all we have there um I don't think he has that     
2:16:30     
figure that I showed from the conference in the paper but that's basically the     
2:16:37     
idea yeah yeah I I I brought up     
2:16:42     
um the Northbridge um so Northbridge and     
2:16:49     
Southbridge are you know computer systems engineering terms for     
2:16:54     
the the kind of like motherboard layout     
2:17:02     
yeah right so computer     
2:17:08     
being actually a quite a diverse set of of other other processors in addition to     
2:17:16     
the CPU right and and so Bridge deals with     
2:17:23     
um yeah you're you're bridging you're bridging a number of I don't know if you     
2:17:29     
want to call them microcontrollers and CPUs or but     
2:17:35     
certainly a lot of um a lot of differently designed chips and then     
2:17:42     
South Bridge would be your connections to again a number of other chips but     
2:17:47     
mostly chipsets involved in sensor yeah processing right and and which you know I think I     
2:17:54     
think also has its its place in this kind of neuro AI discussion and it's     
2:18:01     
it's that like you sensory systems and cameras Etc have their own there in     
2:18:07     
setad of issu but you know just just again thinking you know comments that I     
2:18:13     
made on the the organoid intelligence slack like like you know who's working     
2:18:19     
on the kind of North Bridge of of Bio     
2:18:26     
to artificial you know or or bio to you     
2:18:33     
know silicon and and what would it um     
2:18:39     
what would it involve and and you know I I again I like that we talk about     
2:18:45     
neuromorphic Computing because it is an interesting area and     
2:18:51     
you know I kind of felt like you know he he would probably gain from looking more     
2:18:57     
at neuromorphic systems than than say some of the traditional AI conferences     
2:19:04     
yeah again just pointing out how kind of you know how hinton's kind of work is     
2:19:13     
not really not really relevant to to um neuro computing     
2:19:21     
um uh uh but maybe well so so one just like like kind of speaking to that     
2:19:28     
transmitter issue where it's just like these are these are more about the narratives that we tell right like like     
2:19:37     
you could have a discussion of what are called neuromorphic chips and we could     
2:19:43     
call them some we could we could have we could talk about something else right     
2:19:49     
that that relates to kind of like Point processes or you know binary neural Nets     
2:19:55     
or something like that right and and give it a narrative that relates to I     
2:20:01     
don't know Gene regulatory networks or something like like and I I like I like     
2:20:07     
this comment from um this comment from Michael Leavin on     
2:20:12     
this recent um recent podcast interview that he did where he said um he said     
2:20:21     
you know I forget if it's him or his lab jokes about this but he's like you can     
2:20:27     
take any neuro paper you can replace you know search and replace uh every time     
2:20:35     
neuron appears replace it with cell and every time milliseconds appears replace     
2:20:42     
it with seconds and you'd have a developmental paper you know like like     
2:20:48     
you'd have an embryology paper and and you know the the point being that     
2:20:55     
like you know to to that point right that you     
2:21:01     
could ex you could have a gene regulatory Network narrative about what we call     
2:21:09     
spiking neural network neuromorphic chips and that that that this the yeah     
2:21:17     
that it gives you it gives you the same it gives you the same result or gives     
2:21:23     
you the same action and the same complexity and um uh you know it's just     
2:21:32     
it's it again would be perhaps derived from a different time scale but     
2:21:39     
um so one that's that's super interesting or you know like again it says something about like these are     
2:21:46     
these are stories that we've overlaid on technology right right and not NE neily the the representing the technology     
2:21:53     
itself and then two you know like again like how useful are neurom you know how     
2:22:01     
useful is it to even think about neuromorphic Computing if what you're really interested in is how do I pass     
2:22:09     
work to a biological system get get computation done on that     
2:22:17     
that data and then pass it back right like like how little we've thought about     
2:22:24     
that issue just even you know even data iio right and and and how yeah and and     
2:22:34     
again like pointing at the you know I think it's     
2:22:39     
Fang there it's there in the midwest sorry you guys     
2:22:46     
all together but in your neighboring state of Indiana okay     
2:22:52     
um uh um you know like Reservoir Computing is is an approach that doesn't     
2:22:58     
require biological system you know and and so I I pointed out that you know     
2:23:05     
Adam adami has a a new paper on Reservoir Computing with biological     
2:23:12     
colloids you know okay and it's just like like like I I know that biological     
2:23:18     
is in that name yeah or you know I know biological is in that title but like     
2:23:23     
it's a Col right like like we could we could make yeah yeah yeah yeah so yes     
2:23:30     
there's there is there's some subtleties to its composition but you know that is not     
2:23:38     
that is not um living matter yeah right and it really speaks to Reservoir     
2:23:44     
Computing um uh as being a way to get     
2:23:49     
Computing without tackling the actual key questions of how do I interface with     
2:23:56     
Biology and you know like past data you know and like like these kind     
2:24:04     
of I mean I have trouble not falling into Von nyman     
2:24:10     
definitions of I think we all do because it's like     
2:24:16     
yeah we all do right and and and um and that     
2:24:22     
those you know if we want to make that bridge right that     
2:24:29     
um uh we need you know this this is why I think synthetic biology is one of     
2:24:37     
these areas where it will be a key part of     
2:24:46     
of organoid intelligence or you know what whatever you want to call this area     
2:24:51     
yeah just because it's it will be as much about     
2:24:57     
engineering biology as it is about um about kind of     
2:25:03     
neuromorphic systems right so it could be that neuromorphic systems are one of the kind of interface technologies that     
2:25:11     
we use because you know like like spiking     
2:25:17     
is to some degree a a language that we know biological neural networks speak     
2:25:24     
you know um but but they won't be the actual     
2:25:30     
implementation itself right I mean it's still you know there there's still this     
2:25:37     
you know I I want to say this this real Gap I mean you know we we are fully air     
2:25:46     
gapped from from from the biology at this point because I yeah yeah so yeah I     
2:25:53     
had two points yeah yeah one is that I I mean synthetic biology uses a lot of     
2:26:00     
sort of Van metaphors as well at least well maybe not van metaphors but it uses     
2:26:06     
like this idea that biology or that DNA is information processing and and to     
2:26:12     
some extent that's what they do they Implement that principle and they bring it back to like saying okay if if DNA is     
2:26:20     
like an information processing thing or it's holding information and say like transcription     
2:26:26     
is processing information we can Implement that in a simple circuit and show that that works and manipulate it     
2:26:32     
so you're really kind of making it more experimentally sound but on the other hand you're making assumptions about     
2:26:39     
what biological systems are doing and you're just showing like okay these are discrete states that produce something     
2:26:46     
as an output is that you know what does that mean need is that information or is     
2:26:51     
that like maybe we need a new information theory for synthetic biology     
2:26:57     
or something and then the other point I was going to make was that uh well you     
2:27:02     
know when when we talk about the adamatzky work on colloids there is actually instead of like the thing you     
2:27:09     
were talking about with Lev where you can replace kind of the neuro approach with the embriology approach people also     
2:27:17     
uh you know in development they talk about uh soft active material so basically you can use a model intended     
2:27:24     
for something like colloids and describe a biological system and they use the same type of they can replace certain     
2:27:30     
words and it can become like a a development paper you know uh that type     
2:27:37     
yeah yeah yeah is being you know colloids and slime molds and things like     
2:27:42     
that being just again on on a much slower time scale right right just time     
2:27:48     
scale right now no and I mean I I think some of the best PL intelligence papers     
2:27:56     
is just like you know our our only problem with understanding plain intelligence is that they're going so     
2:28:03     
slow yeah yeah like like like we we you know we need to slow down and and     
2:28:11     
realize that you know the Deep lab cut of of for plant intelligence is is a     
2:28:18     
camera that's running for like three weeks yeah yeah     
2:28:25     
yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure yeah I I the point um or certainly like like     
2:28:34     
I'm kind of using synthetic biology as as a name for definitely the kind of     
2:28:41     
stuff that you're describing but also for like optogenetics like oh right yeah     
2:28:46     
I mean just just where you know again like like the tagline of or you know     
2:28:53     
sometimes um people say synthetic biology and sometimes they say     
2:28:59     
engineering biology right inad you know like like flipping out a rim and that's     
2:29:06     
that's kind of the the you know I think of optogenetics as like that is like engineering biology right is is you know     
2:29:14     
making it amenable to to our um to to     
2:29:20     
our our agency right and and um yeah     
2:29:25     
yeah but but you know I I think it's still really key to follow like     
2:29:31     
neuromorphic Computing nanofabrication and and a lot of these things just in terms of you know you     
2:29:38     
you'll want to understand you know you'll want to understand things at that molecular cellular level and you know to     
2:29:45     
be able to start to engineer it right yeah so yeah universality for the win I guess     
2:29:53     
because you have like the these common processes over these different systems yeah yeah well you know or let's     
2:30:01     
say you know Michael lein for the win in the sense of you know multiscale uh um you know mind     
2:30:09     
everywhere yeah yeah or I guess what would Levan do do you know what you're talking about yeah yeah so something we     
2:30:18     
should always we should be asking SS every day okay well I think that's enough for today um thanks for attending and uh     
2:30:26     
have a good week we'll have our last meeting of the year next week all right sounds good all right thanks bye take     
2:30:33     
care take care bye bye

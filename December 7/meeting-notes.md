## NOTES
Jesse, update: finishing up UCSD Masters’ — like to schedule intentional discussion. Project management ahead of January.

last meetings of the year — next 1-2 weeks. Need a noontime Friday meeting.

1) NYCWiC (maybe an ethics buffet, workshop route), 2) WeRobot, 3) EI conference.  

navigation, facilitation, management. 


JoPro — in its own state of being, small grant award, civic engagement.

applied Frontier Maps. Basics for trajectory awareness. 

not governance-oriented, but a governance lens.


Pre-paradigmatic, Popperian science, Gamification.

reading out to inclusive3 gaming conference people.

call for ideas (internal). What to do for WeRobot.

Jen, Jesse — mental health (grant proposal). Related working group. 


Promotional work: Bluesky starter pack, reminders for x,y,z.

things to highlight from monthly, quarterly work.

reaching out to Santa Fe, other institutes.

at least 5 specific tasks, moving projects. SIM-focused hub for computer science.


Educational initiatives that we need to move on.

updates are work, changing practices, CODA docs, send out with newsletter.

board meetings: NeuroTechX versus Celsius — changes in culture.

Weeklies —> Updates —> Channels.


ActInf external partnership (most interesting).

 Organoid Intelligence (OI) Slack —> elevate the biology.

Thomas Harding, co-authors on OI paper. Swiss OI company (Cortical Labs).

scope of work limited by commercial needs.



Tyler Cohen —> Emergent Ventures.

different development priorities, timelines.

TFAS society meeting — bringing products to market (hard with OI).


2025 plans — not posting things on Slack unless documented on other platforms.

CODA, Notion. Organoids, Computational Psych are backed up on Discord.

25k in funding, mentoring. Wet lab dish brain.

Yael Niv — founder in computational psychiatry. Lisa Feldman Barrett, Grace Lindsay, Daniela Rus.

computational psychiatry starter pack —> ActInf approach.

Neuromodulation @ NeurIPS (papers).

recent Hinton, Vector Institute. Recap of all cool research.


Biology replacing Artificial Intelligence (focus on energy demands).

link curation on Science Corporation —> development Psych @ NeurIPS. Medical Imaging.

what conferences would we draw from? OI?


Cold Spring Harbor. 3-WD Brain development. Biological Computational Processing —> digitize.

science.xyz —> Max Hodak. Interface, material design, nano fabrication, fine control of cellular biology.

Gael Varoquaux — tabular issues in AI (ScikitLearn-related).

casual representation — “gonna need a bigger map”. Open-world Agents —> world models, open-ended.

Yann LeCun — engineering challenges. SciforDL workshop —> “NeuroAI for Ai safety”, Patrick Minneault.


North/SouthBridge — motherboard layout. Additions to CPU —> microcontrollers (processors), sensors (capture).

Bio2Silico —> who is working on this?

Neuromorphic > Conventional AI

point processes, binary NNs, GRNs. A GRN narrative of SNN Neuromorphic chips.

Levin: Neuro paper is similar to a Dev paper. ms —> sec, neuro —> cell. Universality at different time-scales.

you have an embryology paper (same action spaces, complexity).

1) stories overlain on technology, 2) utility of Neuromorphic —> if you want to do Data I/O.

Feng Gu — reservoir computing. Adamatsky — colloid-based biocomputing.

how do I interface with biology? “von Neumann definitions of computing” bias?

synthetic biology will be a key part of organoid intelligence.

* Neuromorphic —> Interface Tech.

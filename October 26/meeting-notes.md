## Notes
Montreal NeuroAI conference (MAIN).

* workshops -- Friday (tutorials day. Scikit-Learn).

* workshop that might be (NIH, November 12-13, NeuroAI).

* does Neuro inform AI, and does ML inform neural data?


More computational Neuro -- conference -- EEGx (virtual/online).

* are foundation models enough now or anymore (overhyped terminology)?

* trend is not fully-enough absorbed (goes away).

* hype is consuming itself. Influencer/Academic stuff.

* how many things do I know of through social media?


Question: clinical AI event, preprints. Not first-mover bias, but a conformity bias.

* pressure to have a social media component. 


ROSCon -- discourse.ros.org -- Robot Operating System. Discourse for community.

* software that touches a lot of research.

* manipulation, path planning, hand-held mapping, Sim2Real transfer, agent planning.

* Finite Element Models -- robotics becomes more biomimetic.

* COLLAs (conference on lifelong learning). Spelke -- keynote @ NeurIPS. Cognitive development -- AI conferences.

* no dev, cog, embodiment in NeuroAI.

Materials spread across three conferences (robotics, MAIN, COLLAs) --> put all together --> BioAI.

* continual, Neuro data, embodied. Foundational domains --> everything gets mapped to that.

* Jesse: meeting (Thurs) -- Robin's take on Bergson (where is memory stored?) -- go to Page 16-18 (about halfway).

* debate -- dovetails into consciousness. Memory is distributed, how do you put back together (humpty dumpty with brain damage). 

* perception as memory (perceived stuff is already memorized).

* Hutto and Myin -- incoming causal chains discarded in making a pattern.

* incoming sensation --> x --> pattern formation. Gibsonian Information ties?

* LearnMem conference 2018 --> 5-year cycle. Physical memory aspect. Problematic evidence for easily stateable theory.


"Language and the Brain" -- gathers edge cases that doesn't map to established theories and metaphors.

* distributed nature of memory (engram). Primbram -- surgical populations, Neurosurgery --> to get into brain, need to cause damage.

* SOLMS -- theories derived from brain damaged cases (H.M.). How does function return -- localization of function vs. redundancy.

* Dynamic Memory Lab @ Davis (LearnMem 2023).

* Disrupting circuitry vs. discovering function (only get data from places you've collected it from).

* cerebellar work (statistical analysis). Statistical network -- distributed architecture. Resting networks --> dynamical systems.

* statistical networks -- distributed architecture. Resting networks --> dynamical systems.

* BICA stiff --> Morphofunctional models. Realism. many systems, subsystems @ play.

* need to fix as much variability as possible.

* mundane actions --> interplay more formal computational models --> Winter School of Cognitive Modeling --> dynamical models.

* anatomical modeling -- examples of hierarchical control, neural compositional strategies.

* layer-specificity. Cocomac --> tract tracingdataset. Non-human primate work. 

* Carbon Copies talk -- Drosophila brain model (Logan and Randal).


Many scales at which people currently collect data. Database @ different scales.

* origin of brain -- what bridges MRI to single-cell work?

* white paper on whole-brain emulation. Get function from structure (Morgan does not agree, AI safety-alignment).

* synthetic program (Makram), complete idea of CryoEM across organisms.


Big Brain detail, in a reasonable time. "Comparative Prospects" paper. Focus on Carbon Copies JClub.

* connectome-constrained networks --> DNM of fruit fly system.

* Shiu paper. Simulations using Drosophila. Flywire data, used to SNN model (in a reduced fashion).

* get olfactory behaviors out of the system. Super computationally efficient (full cable model vs. Shiu's model).

* motivated by good neural network theory.

Can't push any computational work to biology at this point.

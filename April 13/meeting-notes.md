## NOTES
Hussain: working with Dick Gordon.

* capillaries with breast cancer diagnosis. Polycapillary optics.


3-D modeling in Blender, Unity.

* ClosedAndOpenWorm: needs further direction — CNNs to process C. elegans data, RNNs to process/generate data for ML.

* OpenWorm, DevoWorm: getting things together. Lots of tools and approaches here, needs more attention and application.


AWS certification. AWS for research. Non-profit org benefits. 

* high-end infrastructure.

Morgan — AWS-related. NeuroDesk dev. Containerization is useful.

ORACLE — once gave away a lot of free credits.

NIRS — meeting —> Cognitive Load, Conscious Tech meeting. 

* NeuroSpatialAI meeting (VR-BCI). 

“How to Grow Almost Anything”. Foresight and the future of humanity. Focus: NeuroTech.

DeepTech —> neurotech advancements.


Ed Bowden — Picower. Dementia treatment with 40Hz stimulation.

Lymphatic system (new-ish neural system).

Braingeneers, Celsius meetings, cerebral organoids.

NeuroTechnews/scene. no CogFutures mFinish AI Cures post (today).


Tale of Two Aprils — ABM tutorial.

* NYCWiC — first time without longtime captain.

* sometimes things stop when leaders step down.

* extremely high impact, low visibility.

* no CogFutures meetings over the past few weeks. Need to return.


CybRG — like what we are doing with that.

* project-based learning, things developed in terms of outcomes.

* channel of discussion — memory, Levin’s work, critique of computational POV.

* camps of different viewpoints.


Jesse: respects polemic papers. Helps delineate stuff.

* ThoughtFormsLife blog FAQ. Need a FAQ for our stuff?

* Rosen’s M,R systems for next CybRG.

* Plot Twisters: Inclusive Gaming Conference. Alife —> Agent-based Modeling workshop.


Society, ethics, Technology team. Modeling endeavors.

SET — revisit over the summer.


NIH computational psychiatry. Definition.

* application of neural models, data, etc.

* physiological relevance. Deep learning — other methods.

* labels (DSM) are not always appropriate. What are the open Qs?


RDoC vs. a trans-diagnostic view paper.

Mumford (stats), Fair (developing brain).Topological, full physiological models.

Amanda discussions: easy to find differences are deceptive, particularly in psychedelics research.

* what is your goal and what is the physiological relevance?


PRISE: architecture of LLMs to better understand action. Invasive implant work in cortex.

* joint angles as representational grist (forward model — how to program robots).

* redescription of action models with LLM vocabulary.


Action <—-> Language. Completion of action requires learning, procedure, declarative information (subactions).

* tool use —> next-gens agent training.


Autism research — phonemes, connectors, genomes.

Neurodegeneration — abstract thinking, mathematical degredation, linguistic ability (in the same order as humans).

* LLMs picking up something about mind’s knowledge graph (fuzzy retrieval system of data corpus).

* LLM structure — our conception of consciousness.

Systems in which measures are coupled. Stuff is linked hard to derive coupled equations (shared genomic risk, landscape). overlap with other diseases.

* neurodevelopment is central to all of this (spatial morphogenesis).

* geometric algebra — expanding basic rules, complexity of structure.


Information processing with basic/more complex functions.

Computation —> Cognition —> Consciousness. Crowd, but not avoiding anthropometry. Pancomputationalist view.

* what’s going on outside the word stuff?

* LLMs as a model for humans, consciousness? Comparison to computational, animal models.

* ML Street talk —Chris Bishop — data scientist @ Microsoft.

* good stochastic parrot or mastery? If LLMs passes a test.

1) how are we not stochastic parrots? 2) benchmarks keep getting knocked down (not sufficient)? 3) interesting structure of models.


Disordered weighting (mental disorders). Precision therapy —> Bzdok’s approach to physiological measures.

* tailored useful space for diverse intelligences. Human brain/behavior will do.

* is this uniform, or different information processing styles.


Oncology has been leading the way —> system dynamics, leading the way.

* systems dynamics, leading the way.


Multiple paths of cognitive operation. Alternate methods of getting expression from subject.

* game where the goal is to fail, study how to fail, how people struggle during failure.

* homeostatic aspect: Gradient Descent through Brinespace.

This is starting to feel like another meeting in another group if we talk more about aws vs oracle haaaaap 
🤖jesse says:
Is there a link for the concious tech meeting 
🤖jesse says:
I need to do more there and also maybe with the kind of vr learning hussain  mentioned

Hi everyone ! is it possible to have the link of conscious tech collective ?

it's morgans first link above 
Jes (OREL) says:
https://lu.ma/8dezno6i
 I wonder if there are other links or thigns though - I think it's just an in person meeting in SF

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
- There's a great article somewhere about the influence of "computational" /cs on other fields, I forget if we talked about it here or not . Yeah along those lines. 
Jes (OREL) says:
👍 
Jes (OREL) says:
Does he comment about a student also wielding LLM or technloties , and what hed say about that? 
Jes (OREL) says:
a discussion for another time re student/lLMM/genAI: it's honestly a weird time to be a student and to be going into industry where people are 100% using these tools -- to some degree --- and there's expertise require dto verify and check these gencodes for. 
Jes (OREL) says:
Oh I missed thtat paper. 
Jes (OREL) says:

Adama
Adama says:
I have a little question  beacuse MBTI is quiet controversal I think I don't get it is relevant to exploit on the study ( about gaming and therapy)

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
👍 
Jes (OREL) says:
it also provides a more authentic space where a uniform environment can have actual meaningful differences in the minds interacting w them 
Jes (OREL) says:
re Adama MBTI above - I am out on the theory myself (even compared to socionisc etc), BUT, using better theories and new theories, like ones Avery (in the lab/PT)  is making, I think would be much more valuable 
Jes (OREL) says:
('Kobiyashi maru' is a star trek scenario from the series ... it's about how the training candidate would act in a situation they 'cannot win', and how they act under the pressures of failure, etc)

## NOTES
Computationally-intelligent symbiosis.

all the rich funders interested in a model of the virtual cell. Cell models, agency, drug response.

deal with multiple objectives, mutation operators based on world knowledge versus hand-coded operators.

math as a training ground, but also a toy problem.


Autocomplete, transformer. Prediction, temporal sequences.

post-transformers — are ActInf models the way forward?


Foresight — Neurotech weekend videos. They are missing the Levin part.

transformer model — with good mechanistic models.

connect to Levin regulatory network machine (GRNs).

analog computing, computation being fundamental to growth, complexity (extend 2-D Pong).


Add to ALife simulations with a slightly more CS approach.

focus on virtual cells — stay DevoWorm relevant. 

bioengineered intelligence.


DevoWorm, November 17.

epithelium CAS models, cell-cell junctions.

“What is Intelligence” book —> collect a lot of different threads.

automatic learning —> performing an action that will have a specific impact.

“Biological Underpinnings of Lifelong Learning” —> Active Inference.

improve upon fragilities of DL, compositionally problems of RL.


Pong example. Goal-oriented behavior in brain tissue.

adaptive tissue response. 


Symbiogenesis — computational life/intelligence.

Levin, single cell model of environment, loop tightens to form anticipation.

2) other like agents, anticipatory system. Cambrian explosion.

Cross-species examples —> oddity in Octopuses — have ToM, but not social. 

Soft Body Control as a mechanism of embodiment.

does soft body control = behavioral affordances.
 

Model Agents —> prepares you for war, prepares you for cooperation.

KL divergence — demonstrate what this looks like (dimensionless form of dynamics of comparison over time).

FTDE — Finite-time Discrete Exponents. KL vs. FTDE.


Reflective Agency — MIT Media Lab. Ground things in philosophy and phenomenology.

useful phenomenology, beyond “here’s the conclusion” of LLM output.

Blaise paper on computational life.


Active Inference of Emergent, Collective Behaviors.

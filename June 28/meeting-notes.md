## NOTES
Lower the barrier to entry for "wet lab" techniques.

* vascular bioprinter.

* HBR Social Media (generative AI and Brain Imaging).


fNIR-focused ultrasound. AI is not useful for schizophrenia. Tissue self-organization.

* Griffiths, Neural Field Theory workshop.


Deep Tech Week --> SF. Lots of cross-posting --> you can get in a lot of people.

* "short sleepers" sleep 5 hours/day without health problems (physiological limits).

* METARC group: Stability AI, backed community-building.

* Neuroimaging analysis, Paul Scotti + CogNeuro (EEG people).

* culturing + recording neurons, Biopunk labs.


Genspace -- NYC BioLab. Instantiation of the Mind In Vitro.

* paradoxscience.org --> FQXi essay contest.

* Braitenberg --> developmental processing (morphogenesis) --> information processing comes later, only constrained by development. Braitenberg says that it is never intertwined.

* comparison of nervous system with the digestive system (information processing or merely physiology).

* lu.ma/home --> ekkolapto (Luca DelDeo) --> mindfulness (future of meditation). meditationartifacts.org

* present shock (future shock-related: attention, etc).


Information Theory --> inherently not physical? Is this the best tool?

* 1um x 1ms --> fundamental unit of action in the brain --> action potential state.

* Pandemonium model. Relevant to cybernetics, non-embodied behavior.

* William Hahn --> FAU Robotics (language, synesthesia).

* "Builder's Guide to the Tech Galaxy" --> juggling of meaning and direction.

* "Microdosing on Apathy". augmentationlab.org

* transdisciplinary (philosophy-builders).


Braitenberg's Manifesto --> 10+ points.

Cultural computers --> how ideas develop (niche vs. mainstream).

* social coordination (boundaries, shape of online spaces).

* translate between niche topics.

* modern Twitter --> operates by a "theory of malevolence".

* context, depth of association. Does your information have structure and scaffolding?


Not all-to-all selectivity (structure). Build on top of contingency (scaffolding).

* all to all mappings in cerebral cortex. Global maps to local.


Classic Facebook --> when will it be put to rest.

* social network --> data repository.

* classic social media platform --> totally obsolete.


No longer need to "find people" and "create a discussion" --> bake in theories and ideas.

* where to put academic papers, professional articles?

* Neodisciplinary --> informatics --> new language and technology for a familiar problem.

* no need to discuss in a conventional way.

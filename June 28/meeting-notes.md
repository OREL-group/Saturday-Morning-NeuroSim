[Valentino Braitenberg and his Cognitive Manifesto](https://youtu.be/xfO4V_JyOTo)

## NOTES
Lower the barrier to entry for "wet lab" techniques.

* vascular bioprinter.

* HBR Social Media (generative AI and Brain Imaging).


fNIR-focused ultrasound. AI is not useful for schizophrenia. Tissue self-organization.

* Griffiths, Neural Field Theory workshop.


Deep Tech Week --> SF. Lots of cross-posting --> you can get in a lot of people.

* "short sleepers" sleep 5 hours/day without health problems (physiological limits).

* METARC group: Stability AI, backed community-building.

* Neuroimaging analysis, Paul Scotti + CogNeuro (EEG people).

* culturing + recording neurons, Biopunk labs.


Genspace -- NYC BioLab. Instantiation of the Mind In Vitro.

* paradoxscience.org --> FQXi essay contest.

* Braitenberg --> developmental processing (morphogenesis) --> information processing comes later, only constrained by development. Braitenberg says that it is never intertwined.

* comparison of nervous system with the digestive system (information processing or merely physiology).

* lu.ma/home --> ekkolapto (Luca DelDeo) --> mindfulness (future of meditation). meditationartifacts.org

* present shock (future shock-related: attention, etc).


Information Theory --> inherently not physical? Is this the best tool?

* 1um x 1ms --> fundamental unit of action in the brain --> action potential state.

* Pandemonium model. Relevant to cybernetics, non-embodied behavior.

* William Hahn --> FAU Robotics (language, synesthesia).

* "Builder's Guide to the Tech Galaxy" --> juggling of meaning and direction.

* "Microdosing on Apathy". augmentationlab.org

* transdisciplinary (philosophy-builders).


Braitenberg's Manifesto --> 10+ points.

Cultural computers --> how ideas develop (niche vs. mainstream).

* social coordination (boundaries, shape of online spaces).

* translate between niche topics.

* modern Twitter --> operates by a "theory of malevolence".

* context, depth of association. Does your information have structure and scaffolding?


Not all-to-all selectivity (structure). Build on top of contingency (scaffolding).

* all to all mappings in cerebral cortex. Global maps to local.


Classic Facebook --> when will it be put to rest.

* social network --> data repository.

* classic social media platform --> totally obsolete.


No longer need to "find people" and "create a discussion" --> bake in theories and ideas.

* where to put academic papers, professional articles?

* Neodisciplinary --> informatics --> new language and technology for a familiar problem.

* no need to discuss in a conventional way.

# TRANSCRIPT
0:02     
hello morning morning     
0:07     
uh yeah so welcome um we had two meetings this week we had the     
0:14     
diva war meeting which was myself and Morgan was the theme this week we had uh     
0:22     
went over three papers actually kind of interrelated     
0:27     
interesting uh dives into a few topics um     
0:35     
and I'd like to go back and look at that meeting again because I thought it was kind of interesting that was kind of     
0:42     
um I also went over some of the data sets for     
0:48     
C elegance embryoenesis some of the work that we did on decomposing lineage trees and this was     
0:55     
like seven or eight years ago and then uh some of the other conneto     
1:00     
data sets that I which mentioned in yesterday's meeting there as well     
1:06     
that being said we had another meeting on Friday or yesterday and that was the     
1:11     
open source meeting and in that meeting we had our updates from our Google Summer code students um     
1:21     
Jesse talked a little bit about expectation setting and then I gave a little talk about     
1:28     
hybrid source or open and closed source strategies for software development     
1:34     
so that was nice meeting um yeah so those are our meetings for this week     
1:41     
um I'm going to make a few announcements here the first announcement is this is     
1:47     
the uh new FQXi physics essay contests uh we've been doing these for probably     
1:54     
10 years now uh we've participated in a few in the past     
2:00     
and they haven't seemed to have had one in a couple years but so this is the new one     
2:05     
um this is I don't know if this is really kind of in the wheelhouse of the lab but this is um the theme for this     
2:13     
year is how quantum is life and so I thought it was interesting because it's this interplay between quantum physics     
2:21     
and biology and um so I mean I don't know maybe there's something there people are     
2:27     
interested in doing this the submissions are open from June 23 to September 29th     
2:33     
so it means that like they're going to be closing the portal on September 29th     
2:40     
um and then of course they have prizes i've never won a prize so I don't know i     
2:45     
doubt we would get one given the topic but uh it's interesting uh if you're     
2:52     
interested let us know this isn't presented in partnership with the Paradox Science Institute which I'm not     
2:58     
familiar with so you know I don't know we should look into the Paradox Science Institute     
3:05     
what they do and all that so this is posted on our uh Mastadon     
3:11     
page for the lab so if you're interested go to that link second thing I'd like to     
3:18     
talk about is this is something I think Morgan posted in the Slack in one of the     
3:23     
channels this is a Janelia conference uh this is back from the end of March to     
3:31     
beginning of April so Uh this is the Janelia research campus i     
3:37     
think it's Janelia Farm where they're meeting and giving these talks and so     
3:44     
this is um I I I call it Janelia Farm i don't know if that's its true name oh     
3:50     
yeah I think it is i mean that's kind of the name it it it definitely was a farm     
3:55     
yeah yeah um Yeah so that's the origins of um Yeah     
4:00     
so this is AI revolution meets 4D biology so it's really kind of     
4:05     
interesting in light of what we do in DVORM um this is the YouTube channel so you can go to their I guess HHMI's genu     
4:14     
research campus site or their their page and go to this um playlist and you know     
4:23     
they they have things like deep learning and developmental biology um building a pedabyte scale pipeline     
4:30     
for AI accelerated in vivo cell biology decoding human cell architectures from     
4:37     
spatial proteell modeling um contextware den noising and semantic     
4:44     
unmixing so they're you know interested in a lot of image processing a lot of uh     
4:50     
big data stuff this data science big data is an early     
4:56     
uh this talk understanding the sources of regenerative capacity in animals so really have to go through these videos     
5:02     
and look at them as well um yeah so that's uh that's also something I want     
5:08     
to talk about the third uh thing this isn't so much an     
5:15     
announcement as it is kind of a food for thought this is a blog post I ran across     
5:20     
I think this week um this is uh from Julian Toelius     
5:27     
uh who I think is a professor at one of the New Yorkities he has his blog it's     
5:33     
on Blogspot so shout out to Blogspot um     
5:38     
and he gives he does this post on what is automatable and who is     
5:44     
replaceable thoughts from my morning commute so this is just kind of going     
5:49     
through like his day or his morning as he leaves his apartment and goes to work     
5:55     
and does his commute what is what are the things in the world that could be replaced with automation     
6:02     
and what things are not so it's uh it's an interesting post so I'll go through     
6:08     
it a little bit so it's an interesting exercise to think about jobs or tasks     
6:14     
within jobs that could in principle be replaced by automation but for some     
6:20     
reason aren't often the reason isn't the state of technology sometimes it's the     
6:25     
state of technology but not in the way that's obviously related to where technology is progressing today see what     
6:33     
I mean come with me on my morning commute tour so this is his morning     
6:38     
commute um in New York City from I guess Brooklyn to Manhattan i can't really see     
6:46     
it sideways but um on the way out of my building I say hi to the doorman just a     
6:52     
quick hi if I'm busy or exchanging a few sentences if I'm not we or rather our     
6:58     
landlord could choose not to have a doorman and instead access cards and perhaps cameras of facial recognition     
7:05     
i'm happy we have a door man often there are some maintenance workers around the lobby so something goes wrong in the     
7:12     
building that can be there to take care of it maintenance work involves lots of tricky manual manipulation and unique     
7:19     
configurations because everyone furnishes their apartment differently changing the drain     
7:25     
pipes looks simple but somehow is not so simple when you try to do it yourself     
7:31     
so then turning the corner he passes a son's daycare the teachers are lovely     
7:37     
that's not just great but necessary otherwise we would not entrust them to take care of our son eight hours a day     
7:45     
letting a machine take care of him is obviously not something we will ever consider     
7:50     
then he gets into retail grocery uh there's a lot of retail where I live on the border of Soho and Greenwich Village     
7:57     
grocery stores delies and big names like Nike and Apple there's even a small Target there's a bunch of small and     
8:04     
unique stores and some very fancy and pricey high fashion boutiques i guess     
8:10     
most of the uh what these stores sell could be bought online and we do get much of our groceries delivered but it's     
8:16     
nice to go shopping in person so there have been attempts to automate grocery retail     
8:23     
um and you know talked about like the large vending machines they experimented     
8:30     
with in the 50s and 60s um and so that only worked when the     
8:35     
stores were closed but when the stores the human uh crude stores were open this idea     
8:43     
failed so it wasn't particularly attractive to people to shop in a place     
8:50     
like that there are also plenty of restaurants um     
8:55     
he mentions even in this post scarcity hyper automated utopia of Star Trek Deep Space 9 where you can extract food from     
9:02     
replicators captain Cisco's father runs a creole restaurant in New Orleans     
9:08     
um so he talks about some of the niche businesses around where he lives     
9:15     
then he go he takes the fra from Broadway Lafayette down to J Street in Brooklyn where my lab is so his lab is     
9:22     
in Brooklyn the Fra is a human driver why does the New York subway have human     
9:27     
drivers while the metro systems of Copenhagen and Singapore are driverless     
9:33     
probably because the latter were designed to be driverless from the ground up so the New York subway doesn't     
9:39     
have barriers a door separating the platforms from the train and so the signaling system is about uh 100 years     
9:45     
old uh I also wonder how much savings there is to be had for making the trains     
9:51     
driverless um I bet we we will continue to train drivers for quite a while     
9:59     
um and he gets into another a number of other types of jobs     
10:05     
uh a lot of jobs that can't be automated are about trust and responsibility     
10:12     
um a lot of jobs are also about communication so it's communication that     
10:18     
all humans can master and it mentions meetings some people     
10:24     
love to complain about how meetings are getting in the way of doing their job but arguably the meetings are the most     
10:29     
important part of the job the more your job is about meetings the less automatable it is that's interesting     
10:37     
um     
10:48     
so this is uh I always tell those of my PhD students who consider a faculty     
10:53     
career that the transition from graduate student to faculty member is rough a PhD     
10:58     
student is mainly concerned with their own research project whereas even a new assistant professor has what feels like     
11:04     
10 to 20 jobs often jobs they're not prepared for including obscure     
11:09     
committees department politics and complaining students the only way I know how to get through this is to slice your     
11:16     
day into slivers contexts which often decide which two or three of these jobs you're going to do well and halfass the     
11:23     
other ones uh so he talks about these jobs as types of tasks um and and there     
11:31     
some that he considers to be the core tasks of a faculty member at a research university lecturing and research     
11:37     
advising and so he mentions that lecturing is not necessarily the optimal mode of     
11:43     
knowledge transfer it was supposed to have been made obsolete by muks or massively online open courses before     
11:51     
that it was supposed to have been made obsolete by lectures over TV radio VHS     
11:57     
or even by books personally I've generally preferred to reading books     
12:02     
nevertheless the lecture persists i think it's largely because of the ritual where a real life human gets up in front     
12:08     
of you and speaks to you forcing you to at least pretend to pay attention so     
12:13     
afterwards you can say you attended a lecture and he's written a post about this in the recent past on the death of     
12:20     
the lecture which maybe another one that's interesting to go through um     
12:28     
when it comes to research advising it's a curious blend of knowing the technology knowing the literature     
12:35     
knowing the personalities that dominate the research field feeling where the wind is blowing seeing patterns sensing     
12:42     
opportunities having a vision being reasonable being unreasonable     
12:47     
and navigating bureaucracy and this kind of goes through talking     
12:54     
about how you know could you have a an automated     
13:00     
or AI advisor and you know maybe but probably not um     
13:08     
see still the evidence seems unambiguous that having a good and compatible advisor mentor helps you become a better     
13:14     
researcher i modeled myself on and learned much from my mentors and adviserss also sometimes intentionally     
13:21     
decided to be less like them than some and so um     
13:33     
and so another reflection is that many of the jobs your people worry about being replaced by automation are jobs     
13:39     
that their grandparents would never have heard of and perhaps not their parents either this makes me wonder whe wonder     
13:45     
whether there's a Lindy effect for jobs that is the longer a profession has been around the longer it is likely to     
13:52     
persist many of the jobs mentioned in the Bible still exist and are even reasonable career choices including     
13:59     
preacher carpenter goldsmith fisher teacher baker merchant politician and     
14:05     
musician in comparison novel professions such as SEO specialist social media manager     
14:12     
drone operator might be less likely to be known by your grandkids it's an     
14:17     
interesting idea uh finally the idea that a task or job would be replaced because a machine     
14:23     
could do it is quite weird when you think about it my parents and many other family members     
14:28     
are visual visual artists some time ago I showed my mother some image generation     
14:34     
models she wondered why anyone would be interested in this and how it had anything to do with her profession     
14:41     
even without machineenerated images there is a near infinite richness of images around because there are 8     
14:48     
billion humans in the world many of them produce images what difference would another source of images make especially     
14:55     
if there are no personal experiences behind them so the personal experiences are what make the images interesting     
15:02     
so that's uh his take on um sort of the automation of things with     
15:10     
AI and this whole conversation i think it's really interesting um     
15:16     
because there's so much hype around people's jobs being replaced in all this     
15:21     
i I don't know if I believe a lot of that hype or conversation     
15:29     
okay um well looks like Jesse is here hello Jesse     
15:38     
let's talk about this um so this is something I think Jesse     
15:45     
pointed to um this is from Mozilla Foundation     
15:51     
this is their uh from their responsible technology division     
15:57     
and this is public AI making AI work for everyone by everyone so they have     
16:06     
so this is they have a paper on this um and I have a link to the paper why don't     
16:11     
we go over the blog post and see what their vision is for this what's going     
16:18     
so a vision for a robust ecosystem of initiatives that promote public goods     
16:23     
public orientation public use through every step of AI development and deployment so this is of     
16:31     
course um in response to a lot of the corporately controlled AI platforms and     
16:37     
sort of the opakeness of it so     
16:44     
as to the overview commercial actors drive the current AI ecosystem for better or for worse while     
16:51     
private companies have created significant innovations in AI ecosystem powered exclusively by the market will     
16:58     
prioritize a narrow set of profitable applications meanwhile critical work such as using AI     
17:05     
to detect illegal mining operations facilitate deliberative democracy and     
17:11     
deliver medicine directly to patient homes which are just examples of what they would like to do with it but isn't     
17:18     
necessarily supported by the corporate said is underresourced relative to its     
17:24     
societal value the status quo poses a major structural risk that is we can't     
17:30     
rely on a few companies to build everything our society needs from AI     
17:35     
and we can't afford the risk that they won't so ensuring AI benefits humanity     
17:42     
requires expanding who has the power and opportunity to build AI in the first place that's why we need public AI a     
17:50     
robust ecosystem of initiatives that promote public goods public orientation and public use throughout every step of     
17:57     
AI development and deployment from how compute and data are provided to how     
18:02     
tools and workers are involved so a few of the project leads Mark Surman Nick     
18:08     
Marta and JZ okay     
18:14     
and if we go to the PDF document um so just mention kind of summarize     
18:21     
what they were talking about first part and then we have the table of     
18:26     
contents so we have their vision for public AI uh the current landscape case     
18:33     
studies roles and recommendations and then alter public alternatives across the AI stack     
18:41     
so why don't we go to the current landscape so public AI doesn't require starting     
18:47     
from scratch the ecosystem today is still in its early stages but demonstrates growth and     
18:54     
viability for a more open decentralized approach many others have also called for greater     
19:00     
investment in public AI or begun building in this way as early as     
19:06     
November 2019 Ganesh Satarum and Ben Gansky and Michael Martin began advocating     
19:13     
for a public option for AI encompassing public data pools increased     
19:19     
R&D spending and a focus on non-military applications     
19:24     
in June 2023 security technologist Bruce Schneider also echoed the call for a     
19:30     
publicly funded large language model so then uh researchers at the Ada     
19:36     
Loveace Institute have highlighted the importance of public compute building     
19:42     
more pluralistic less Silicon Valley ccentric AI ecosystem and organizations from the open data     
19:48     
institute to the US department of commerce have made the case for AI ready open data     
19:54     
sets cecilia Ryap at Commonwealth has highlighted the risks to a big tech     
20:00     
dominated AI ecosystem making the case for more dem for more democratic alternatives     
20:08     
international collaborations on AI are also progressing so for example uh there     
20:13     
has been a UN report released in 2023 providing this governing AI for humanity     
20:19     
roadmap a 2024 G7 report and a 2024 T20 policy     
20:26     
brief suggesting how multilateral democratic governance of AI and advance     
20:32     
sustainable and inclusive development uh there's also this declaration that     
20:38     
calls for fostering AI as a global public good and so a number of governments from     
20:45     
around the world are developing national strategies for how AI can accelerate economic opportunity and social impact     
20:54     
the public AI network has exemplified a multistakeholder approach organizing     
20:59     
seminars and convenings to rally the research policy and technical AI     
21:04     
communities around public AI so they estimate that over the past five     
21:11     
years $850 million has been invested in public AI labs     
21:17     
these are defined as nonprofits developing open source AI models     
21:22     
this includes the Allen Institute for AI uh Qout in France and AI Singapore     
21:30     
accelerating this emergent public AI ecosystem will be vital to continue creating AI infrastructure     
21:37     
for the public that isn't dependent on large AI companies generosity and     
21:43     
incentives um most of the public AI conversation     
21:48     
and activity has been focused on comput and data but they also need investment     
21:54     
in tools and workforce development investing in these areas could yield     
22:00     
significant returns for the entire ecosystem especially in ensuring that compute and     
22:05     
data are actually used for pro-social applications in practice     
22:11     
so they have this diagram here these are examples of private and public alternatives across the AI ecosystem     
22:22     
and so we have these different categories data compute models hosting     
22:30     
modifications applications tools labor and accountability     
22:36     
we have all these different uh public AI examples and contrasting that with private AI examples     
22:44     
so you have uh these different I guess they're institutes and you know     
22:52     
organizations we have OAMA of course here we have     
22:57     
hugging chat we have PyTorch um     
23:04     
I guess Segra is considered for accountability purposes here's DARE     
23:10     
um deep learning in Dava that's for labor pytorches under tools lang chain     
23:16     
is also a tool their open source audit tool project that's um o     
23:25     
uh let's see uh lama is under hosting     
23:32     
um and then we have a lutherai under data as well as common     
23:39     
voice so you can see that there are all these different organizations doing all these     
23:44     
different things in space     
24:04     
so they have this technical appendex public alternatives across the AI stack     
24:09     
um this provides a more detailed technical overview of the progress made towards public alternatives across the     
24:16     
AI technology stack so you have uh for example your data     
24:22     
uh where we need tools for pre-training evaluation fine-tuning and preference data     
24:29     
high quality data data is of course a bottleneck to specializing AI models     
24:36     
so we get this sort of data provider labeling industry that's emerged but we     
24:41     
need better maybe alternatives to that data has long been a focus of public     
24:47     
interest tech and recent efforts have increasingly focused on creating AI     
24:52     
ready data sets that are openly downloadable and licensed however these     
24:57     
efforts do not yet provide a meaningful counterweight to the large proprietary     
25:02     
and unlicensed data sets that many AI models are trained     
25:07     
public entities are also well positioned to open up or organize AI training in     
25:13     
certain domains such as healthcare and weather where they collect better or different data than private entities     
25:20     
so they give some examples here um both of private and public AI     
25:28     
uh the one one is interesting is the alpha fold protein structure database     
25:33     
also the NIH's bridges to AI and you know just depending on what you     
25:39     
need in terms of data um and there's compute so of course we     
25:46     
need chips storage and cloud providers as well as data centers and utility     
25:52     
companies that allow for compute at scale This is often the primary resource     
25:59     
constraint for developers to train more advanced or more proprietary AI models     
26:04     
from scratch but is less of a barrier when existing open source AI models be     
26:09     
fine-tuned for the desired AI application compute has been a key focus of large     
26:15     
public AI efforts so far some initiatives have focused on expanding access to compute to academics while     
26:22     
others are focused on more on helping startups they also vary in terms of where the     
26:27     
compute has been acquired from with some buying compute for from cloud platforms     
26:32     
and others directly acquiring chips from chip manufacturers so public AI examples are here     
26:40     
um NSF has an NIRR pilot DOE has a pilot um     
26:48     
and there something called AI factories and India AI compute capacities so these     
26:54     
are all just kind of public AI examples then we have our models so this is of     
27:01     
course um examples of this include Mistrail Falcon Elmo     
27:08     
uh Google's GMA uh Llama partially um and then a number of nationally     
27:16     
funded public AI models openfold is a public AI model and Aurora GPT so there     
27:24     
are a number of different public examples um of course then deployment so we have     
27:31     
deployment of cloud servers um but also on     
27:36     
you know things in the cloud that you could access on personal computer so you have a llama llama.cpp     
27:44     
and nomic so that's modif or that's That's hosting this isn't under     
27:51     
deployment modifications uh where we want to fine-tune models so     
27:59     
uh this requires uh different types of     
28:04     
adapting these models to specific use cases or maybe like you know doing some sort     
28:11     
of uh offering tools for people to interact with the models     
28:18     
okay um and then applications this is where uh product services and     
28:24     
interfaces that make AI usable in specific contexts and domains so it might be things uh AI applications     
28:32     
for content creation smart assistance monitoring and surveillance tools     
28:38     
automated sales and support agents search engines and manufacturing robots     
28:44     
um and then um then of course the enabling ecosystem involves tools     
28:52     
labor and accountability and so the accountability of course is where we     
28:57     
want to steer development and deployment towards being trustworthy and beneficial     
29:03     
this includes both the individuals within companies who are focused on responsible for deployment and the     
29:09     
regulators journalists data rights holders unions and governance bodies     
29:15     
that work to hold AI deployment accountable uh public AI needs advocates and     
29:20     
accountability practitioners to ensure it lives up to its stated goals as well as to identify what gaps in the current     
29:27     
AI ecosystem need filling okay so     
29:33     
basically we want to make sure the public AI models are not being used     
29:38     
improperly and that they offer an alternative to the private AI models     
29:44     
so public AI could provide an alternative model of AI development that centers workers voices instead or when     
29:52     
public priv or when private AI systems are being used to pollute and fix rents     
29:57     
artificially high public AI systems might try to identify the landlords for     
30:03     
price gouging their tenants     
30:08     
so that was published back in September of 2024 so it's a while that since they     
30:13     
published this but it's I think it's an interesting read to go through and see what they're up to     
30:23     
so something that we talked about uh I don't know a couple meetings ago is I had forgotten that uh Valentino     
30:31     
Bradenberg was a neuroanatomist uh and before he did the book vehicles     
30:37     
so the whole book vehicles is a book about toy models of nervous     
30:42     
systems and he uses the vehicle metaphor because it's this you know thing that     
30:49     
does something it provides a function and so you like a vehicle if you think about a vehicle as like this autonomous     
30:56     
thing it has a brain but it moves and it has different movements towards things in its environment and so throughout the     
31:03     
book vehicles Bradenberg talks about these different designs but critically     
31:09     
on the different wirings inside the vehicles from sensor to aector so the sensors being the things     
31:15     
that take in information from the environment the aectors are the things that move the vehicle through the     
31:22     
environment and so the way it's approached     
31:27     
looks very much like some sort of very simple neural anatomy     
31:32     
but it also resembles cybernetics and the cybernetic control it's interesting     
31:38     
how you know it's not mentioned as an instance of cybernetics at least as a as     
31:45     
a primary example but it is and it provides this you know framework for     
31:52     
thinking about autonomous agents embodied agents but also has connections     
31:58     
in neural anatomy and thinking about those kinds of problems so this is an article from biological     
32:05     
cybernetics it's a journal um it's from 2014     
32:11     
and it's the title is structural aspects of biological cybernetics Valentino     
32:17     
Braenberg neuroanatomy and brain function so this is a picture of     
32:24     
Valentino Braenberg um and     
32:30     
that says they say the best way of introducing Valentino Braenberg is by quoting one of his distinctive arguments     
32:37     
so the quote is here when a new science emerges every couple of centuries those     
32:42     
who are privileged enough to witness it from its very beginnings to its full development during the span of their own     
32:49     
lifetime and indeed count themselves lucky my colleagues and I who became     
32:55     
fully fledged after World War II had precisely this privilege     
33:01     
the science to which I'm referring to still has no proper name but its existence can be testified to by the     
33:07     
manner of course way in which physicists biologists and logicians discuss issues     
33:14     
that do not fall into any of the categories of physics biology or logic     
33:20     
uh their consensus is not so much interdisciplinary which does not bring much more than     
33:26     
admiration from people who don't know much about it as decided neoisiplinary     
33:33     
what does that mean uh neodisiplinary is something that's based on a new     
33:38     
language and terminology that convinces all sides and that is     
33:43     
already so well established that it hardly needs to be discussed any further     
33:50     
that's interesting um so it's based on some new language or terminology     
33:58     
and it's so well established that a hard thing needs to be discussed any further so it gives an example here some call     
34:05     
this new discipline informatics others information science it may sometimes be     
34:11     
narrowed down to neuroinformatics or technical informatics so this is of course thinking about     
34:19     
information science informatics kind of grew out of a number of disciplines     
34:24     
like cognitive science and like cybernetics and you have informatics departments where people come from all     
34:31     
different disciplines and they do things like data science and you know computing and things like that so it's but I don't     
34:38     
know if I would necessarily connect that with neo disciplinaries the way he     
34:44     
defines but anyways um then he goes on to say the term cybernetics     
34:51     
which does not meet with universal approval has nonetheless a good chance of asserting itself in the long run so     
34:58     
this is probably not true because we don't really talk about cybernetics as much as we talk about informatics these     
35:04     
days this is not least due to the fact the term was coined in its mo by its most     
35:10     
brilliant founder mathematician or wier the solid philosophical and bi     
35:16     
biological background is reflected in the fitting name that he gave to this science the designation cognitive     
35:24     
science which is currently popular might well one day apply to everything     
35:29     
that we still refer to as informatics and cybernetics     
35:34     
maybe that I mean there's some aspects of cognitive science that kind of fold in on those fields     
35:42     
um but then again the plain and rather sloppy term computer science might come     
35:47     
up and at the end of the day might be more appropriate as a tribute if you     
35:53     
like to the fact that the whole thing did not get off the ground until large electronic data processors were invented     
36:00     
yet one thing is for sure this new area that has arisen between the humanities and natural sciences while not     
36:08     
professing to belong to either discipline actually actually succeeds in querying the boundaries of both although     
36:15     
no one can be universally knowledgeable there is no longer a wall to prevent us from taking a peak to see what is on the     
36:22     
other side okay so this was actually in 1999 so     
36:27     
there was um sort of at the beginning of what we might call modern informatics     
36:34     
there was a of course informatics really kind of took off in the 90s but you know     
36:39     
we've had 25 years or so since then to sort of get to see that sort of the     
36:49     
realistic nature of his predictions um I'm not sure if they all kind of panned     
36:56     
out but okay um but anyways he goes through um kind of     
37:02     
how he described the sciences of which journal was dedicated to and which he was committed to his own research     
37:09     
the books by Weiner and Shannon and Weaver hit him a prospective brain scientist like a thunderbolt so he's     
37:16     
talking about mathematical theory of communication and then Norbert Weiner's     
37:21     
introduction to cybernetics I believe so this these were books that you know as a     
37:27     
brain scientist he kind of took inspiration from them and in fact like I     
37:32     
think a lot of early cognitive science was like that where people were reading these books that were coming out at the     
37:38     
time out of cybernetics out of that camp and applying it to brain science and     
37:45     
coming up with something new and then you know that's not exactly what cognitive science is of course we've     
37:51     
talked about the cognitive science um hexagon but a lot of the inspiration for     
37:57     
sort of the computational aspect of cognitive science kind of came out of that sort of school of thought     
38:06     
educated as a psychiatrist and neurologist in Rome up to 1954     
38:12     
Valentina Brainberg was driven by the wish to understand the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavior so again     
38:19     
like you know an organism produces behavior you want to know what underlies that behavior it takes you to neuro     
38:27     
anatomy but ultimately it takes you to information processing because you want to know how that information that goes     
38:34     
in one end comes out the other end which is sensor to a factor     
38:39     
um not digestion um although you know I mean it's interesting because people who     
38:45     
study say the digestive system they're not they weren't inspired by these same things so it's kind of an interesting     
38:52     
way to that that um     
38:57     
he was convinced that the study of brain structure and hence neuro anatomy in conjunction with brain theory is a tool     
39:04     
to reach this goal so this is of course thinking about brain theory and brain structure and how those things explain     
39:12     
the generation behavior uh research days took him to the neuroanatomist Oscar vote and Carl Gle     
39:20     
in Germany and later to Yale medical school in New Haven where he made the acquaintance of     
39:26     
the protagonists of cy cybernetics makulla and von Forester so he actually     
39:33     
met the cybernetics kingpins I guess um and um so that was kind of interesting     
39:39     
he had that interaction so he went back to Italy eventually he obtain obtained his habilitation in 1963     
39:48     
in the discipline cybernetics and information theory and became the director of the department of     
39:53     
biocybernetics in at university enables um in 1968 at     
40:00     
the suggestion of Warner Reichart and together with Carl Guts and Kuno Kersfeld he was appointed to be one of     
40:08     
the co-founding directors of the Maxplac Institute for Biological Cybernetics     
40:14     
in Germany other appointments are that of honorary professor at the faculty of physics at the University of Tubingen     
40:22     
the faculty of biology at the nearby university of free so this was um this was an article from     
40:28     
a special issue of biological cybernetics and so he I guess he died in 2011 so     
40:35     
this was uh published in 2014 he died in 2011     
40:42     
um and his work continues to have a strong     
40:47     
influence on modern brain science starting from his clinical experience as a psychiatrist he committed himself to     
40:53     
the investigation of connectivity schemes in the brain and their respective roles for brain function the     
41:00     
focus of his attention was on the visual system of the fly the cerebral and cerebellar cortex of vertebrates and     
41:07     
their role of perception memory movement and language it led to seinal     
41:13     
contributions in all these various fields moreover he was a master in bridging the     
41:19     
gap between the humanities and the natural sciences which is evident from     
41:24     
most of his books his mastery also characterized his lectures and seminars     
41:29     
spanning a wide range of themes related to the brain from neuroanatomy to and     
41:35     
neurohysiology via automa theory so this is the stuff that he did with brainberg     
41:40     
vehicles um information theory and logic through to     
41:45     
clinical topics to language and music never remaining     
41:51     
superficial for providing a participant with the practical tools that contribute     
41:56     
constructive ideas to open questions a fascinating remaining source of     
42:02     
inspiration for many um and then um in this forward we give     
42:09     
Valentina Great not only the first but also the last word by reprinting at the     
42:14     
end of his fascinating manifesto for brain science first published in 1992     
42:20     
and having lost nothing with sparkling actuality till the present day     
42:26     
so this is uh great this is kind of a really deep dive into Bradenberg's work     
42:33     
and how it connects with cybernetics so he really was connected to this news     
42:40     
phase in neuroscience beginning in the 1950s which was the resurrection of     
42:45     
neural anatomy so once Ramoni Gahal published a lot of his work and Laurente     
42:51     
they know published a lot of their work this was all you know this was kind of where neurons were first mapped out     
42:58     
neural networks in the brain were first mapped out and they were drawn by hand and then of course um you know kind of     
43:06     
you have that information right and there's not a lot of work that's being done after that until the 1950s     
43:14     
um and then you know of course you had to wait for things like being able to have     
43:21     
diffusible substances and other types of signals in brain circuits that you can     
43:27     
visualize them and see the flow of electrical signals and information and     
43:33     
all that so that's what they're kind of waiting for in a sense but also you know     
43:38     
it was also kind of thinking about theoretical questions     
43:43     
um and how neuroanatomy can influence that so     
43:49     
um Bradenberg actually almost single-handedly made neuroanatomy into a pillar of brain theory for providing     
43:56     
examples of a direct translation of neural structure into functional schemes that had not yet emerged in the then     
44:03     
prevalent method of neurohysiology so neurohysiology was chugging along it     
44:09     
wasn't necessarily answering the same questions so bringing neuro anatomy back     
44:15     
into the fold was an important uh point and it it had a lot of u you know     
44:21     
theoretical sort of implications his impact on modern brain science is     
44:27     
comparable to that of founders of neurocybernetics who introduced around the same time the     
44:32     
logical analysis of nervous nets so that was of course the mullen pits work     
44:38     
published in 1943 the concept of feedback and amostatic mechanisms that was in 1948     
44:46     
concepts of information and redundancy and perception that was Shannon in 1948     
44:53     
and the neuro theory of associative learning and cell assemblies that was heaven in 1941     
45:00     
so we had these neurohysiological units we had cybernetic feedback     
45:06     
we had information theory and then we had uh ebian learning or associative     
45:13     
learning or the models I have introduced for associative learning all within about     
45:19     
seven years so it's interesting that those things kind of all happened     
45:26     
at the same time and then that inspired Brainberg to work on connect to connect     
45:31     
that with neural anatomy and then make all these discoveries aside from his brain vehicles although he did that as     
45:39     
well so his discoveries were numerous     
45:45     
he one thing he discovered was the cerebellum and this is a structure of the male     
45:52     
brain that is sort of down towards the base of the brain and it's known as a     
45:59     
timekeeping mechanism where it has this temporal aspect to cognition and so he     
46:05     
discovered that the cerebellum was a millisecond clock so Bradenberg's early work on cerebellum     
46:12     
presented the first example of a neuro of anatomical morphology interpreted in     
46:18     
terms of its function down to the level of individual neurons and synapses his     
46:23     
conclusion that the cerebellum is specialized for the measurement of time intervals with a precision of better     
46:30     
than one millisecond become common knowledge even if not undisputed     
46:35     
later versions of his model continue to provide inspiring explanations of the normal cerebellum and motor     
46:43     
um the second one is the exact neural wiring in insects his work on the visual     
46:49     
ganglia of insects originally inspired by behavioral analysis of Warner Reichard in his group in Tubigen led to     
46:57     
the first completed and undisputed explanation of the intricate structure of the neural network that of the fibers     
47:04     
connecting the fly's eye to the visual his neuroanatomical analysis provided     
47:11     
the proof parallel to trajecal     
47:16     
superposition I by Kersfeld so the principle involves the science of     
47:24     
a precise origin and destination to every fiber of the network that was     
47:29     
shown to hold with unairring precision so this is where you you know in in in     
47:36     
mamalian grains usually you have different pathways that can emerge uh in     
47:42     
in insects you have these precise pathways from cell to cell you see this in sea elegance as well with circuits     
47:48     
where you have this these precise sort of origins and destinations for every     
47:54     
connection or every fiber in the network so this is interesting apart from its     
47:59     
importance for visual physiology the finding was of great importance for developmental neurobiology as it showed     
48:06     
the precision to which genetically programmed pre-programmed networks could be expressed and ultimately implemented     
48:13     
so in development you have the brain gets laid out in a certain way and it's always kind of very similar between     
48:20     
organisms and then so you would have to ask well why does that happen is this     
48:26     
just chemical signaling or is there a genetic so they that we kind of worked     
48:31     
that out in that in that area of work um     
48:37     
the cerebral cortex is an associative memory so this is where     
48:43     
uh Brinberg looked at the structure and function of the cerebral cortex     
48:50     
um and he has this book anatomy of the cortex which summarizes the results of     
48:56     
many years of painstaking experimental work it proposes a view of the cortex     
49:01     
quite different from the traditional one that the essence of its wiring seems to support the principle of a great mixing     
49:08     
machine where all data are maximally dispersed so that the convergence of a     
49:14     
large is possible of a sample cortical activity is guaranteed to impinge onto     
49:20     
any one small region of cortex so this is kind of like maybe in in a     
49:26     
lot of ways maybe the precursors to connectionism because it shows in in that kind of     
49:34     
model of cortex you have this network and it's sort of a ball to all network     
49:41     
and you can basically take you know signals from large areas of the     
49:48     
cerebral cortex and focus it down to one small area mixed everything up and um it     
49:56     
basically turns data everywhere in the structure     
50:01     
and it maximally disperses data so it can converge in different areas     
50:08     
uh so it's really an interesting concept um I think it's interesting in in light     
50:14     
of course what will become neural networks and connectionism so yeah we should put     
50:21     
a kind of a pin in that and think about it um the high degree of divergence and     
50:27     
convergence together with the finding that most synapses in the cortex are weak excitatory modifiable strongly     
50:34     
endorse the idea that the cortex specializes in embodying memories in the form of cell assemblies and that goes     
50:40     
back to Heb meanwhile there is a remarkable convergence and hence reciprocal confirmation between the     
50:48     
anatomical findings of Bradenberg and his associates and the physiological     
50:53     
results of various groups around the world and so then he made a number of other contributions to related fields     
51:01     
such as motor control visual physiology information     
51:06     
perception language logic and philosophy behavior and artificial intelligence so     
51:13     
all those areas were kind of his contributions some of the contributions came in the     
51:18     
form of the book vehicles and this is described as an     
51:23     
unconventional yet highly effective introduction to the problems of artificial intelligence     
51:30     
so this is part of a special issue so they give some um kind of discussion of     
51:36     
some special uh some papers of the special issue here um     
51:42     
and kind of growing out of his work uh there's also this manifesto of brain     
51:49     
science so this is like uh I don't know how many points we have here 10 points uh yeah so     
51:58     
I'll go through that really quickly so this is Valentino Braenberg's manifesto     
52:04     
of brain science uh so he breaks us down to 10 points     
52:09     
uh one we believe that there are questions such of such philosophical import that they deserve being pursued     
52:16     
without any consideration of utility one of them refers to the nature of thought     
52:21     
processes or more generally of complex behavior so he was thinking about the     
52:26     
complexity of thought and cognition     
52:32     
during his career number two we are convinced that ultimately a satisfactory explanation of thought and behavior will     
52:40     
be given in a language akin to that of physics in mathematical terms so he was a strong believer in mathematizing     
52:48     
uh behavior and of course thinking and cognition number three the physics of living     
52:54     
organisms with its specialized branches of physiology and biochemistry will be     
53:00     
undoubtedly the basis for such an explanation but it will not be sufficient by itself as a theory of     
53:06     
behavior in fact when boiled down to physical fundamentals a mouse or even a     
53:12     
worm is not very different from man we are ultimately interested in thought and behavior of people not of worms so this     
53:19     
kind of talks about this i don't know when this came with respect to sea     
53:24     
elegance being established as a model organism but definitely thinking about     
53:31     
sea elegance and how that relates to human cognition and human neurohysiology     
53:37     
um and then for the difference in behavior of different species reflect     
53:42     
different ways of coping with the environment or the distinct niches of the environment these different     
53:48     
behaviors have their material counterpart in different brains therefore the peculiar nature of any     
53:54     
animal brain cannot be explained from their physical components alone the     
53:59     
explanation necessarily involves causes residing outside the animal information     
54:05     
deriving from the environment so this is an informationbased explanation but also     
54:10     
an environmental based explanation number five concepts such as Shenonian     
54:18     
information which is of course Claude Shannon's information theory u which     
54:23     
became the standard definition of information but is by no means the only     
54:29     
definition of information even mathematically speaking     
54:34     
coding computation are outside of physics even if the formulas look like physics indeed     
54:41     
Shannon's information is very analogous to uh uh thermodynamics and um you know     
54:51     
the formulations provided by Boltzman but they're um outside of physics     
54:58     
somehow i I guess it's because it's about information um as a structure and doesn't really     
55:06     
describe entropy even though sometimes people describe it as information entropy but anyways um but his point     
55:14     
here is that they are central to brain science so you think about like channing     
55:20     
information encoding there are a lot of coding um     
55:25     
uh theories and methods and techniques for looking at how signals are encoded     
55:32     
and then there's also of course computational neuroscience those are all central to brain science uh those are     
55:38     
kind of at least central to early like maybe mid-century brain science and     
55:44     
thinking about how information processing occurs uh then of course this     
55:49     
is linked to electronics and computer science this is the basis for a lively discourse     
55:55     
between certain branches of engineering and brain science i think that's kind of the whole basis of you know where we     
56:02     
came from with neural networks so you know there were of course in early cognitive science in that cognitive     
56:08     
science um hexagon we have computer science sometimes people put electrical     
56:15     
engineering in there and then of course we put psychology and maybe sometimes     
56:22     
neuroanatomy although it's largely a dialogue between psychology and computer     
56:27     
science but it's interesting how he kind of brings up some of these points that     
56:34     
aren't in the uh cognitive science hexagon     
56:39     
another common aspect is that both deal with functions directed to a goal which physics does not so he makes that     
56:45     
distinction about teology where you have functions goal directed functions that     
56:52     
are distinct from physics so putting that together we're talking about     
56:57     
Shannon information we're talking about how it's not physics but it's central to     
57:02     
understanding how the brain processes information and then that there's this school directedness that is makes it     
57:09     
kind of separate from physics and that kind of is put together theoretically to     
57:15     
describe neural information processing number six or object being the discovery     
57:22     
of computer like operations and brains is definitely a neural computationist     
57:27     
and we talked about that a while back with our discussions about     
57:33     
um you know is the brain a computer have those videos up on our YouTube channel     
57:40     
and it was a really interesting conversation i never thought to bring uh     
57:45     
Valentina Greenberg into the mix but uh anyways he had some thoughts on this and     
57:51     
his thoughts were that this is something we should pursue um the hypothesis we test hypotheses we     
57:59     
test in our experiments are really inventions of computing schemes and therefore necessarily more complex than     
58:07     
the hypotheses of other branches of science thus we are inventors of computing devices much as our colleagues     
58:14     
in artificial intelligence are we can learn from them as much as they can learn from us this is this whole neuro     
58:20     
basis of the neuroi debate that they have about well what can you what can a computer scientists     
58:28     
learn from neuroscience and vice versa and you know it's usually a pretty     
58:34     
trivial conversation about applications but um you know this is something that     
58:40     
we can think about theoretically as well number seven uh computation in brains is     
58:46     
a fine grained operation requiring a spatial resolution of about 1 to 10     
58:52     
micrometers so this is where thinking about like if brains are doing computing     
58:57     
they're doing this at a very small scale much like computers do where you know you have logic gates that are very small     
59:04     
in fact in modern you know as as we get smaller and smaller chips as logic gates     
59:09     
get tinier and tinier and so we're dealing with spatial resolution about 1 to 10 micrometers so     
59:17     
that's pretty small um the functional elements are fibers and neurons and in most cases many     
59:23     
neurons are involved in significant functional patterns this requires     
59:28     
special techniques of observation which are being developed multiple electron     
59:34     
recording optimal optical recording by means of voltage sensitive dyes in most     
59:40     
cases the vast amount of information produced by these recording techniques could only be stored and digested by     
59:47     
means of large computers so he's again making that connection between digital     
59:52     
computers and and uh neural computers very popular at that time to think about     
59:59     
that sort of those analogies down to the level of like the the techn     
1:00:05     
specific technologies and specific things going on the brain     
1:00:11     
um number eight we believe that the distribution of electrical signals observed at a spatial resolution of one     
1:00:18     
micron and a temporal resolution of about 1 millisecond     
1:00:23     
is all we need to know as a material counterpart behavior so we really just     
1:00:30     
need to have this sort of specific spatial and temporal resolution in each     
1:00:36     
neuron or each unit of the brain to understand the generation of the     
1:00:43     
behavior may be modified by hormones or by pharma but only or by pathological     
1:00:50     
imbalance or some neurotransmitter substance but the actual effect of these is always expressed in terms of the     
1:00:56     
occurrence or not occurance of action potentials in he's an action potential     
1:01:02     
first person he doesn't care about some of the modifiers of behavior to model is     
1:01:08     
like action potentials at the scale of one micron by 1 millisecond and then     
1:01:14     
adding those up or finding the emergent properties of those to describe behavior     
1:01:20     
um a more fine grain analysis say at the molecular level is relevant for the     
1:01:26     
understanding of the individual cell but probably unnecessary for understanding of behavior or may even obscure the     
1:01:33     
picture there so again he's not it's not that he's a reductionist so much it's that he's picked out a specific unit of     
1:01:41     
analysis he finds that's most important the modifiers are sort of maybe adding in noise that you don't need now that     
1:01:48     
you one could argue that that's not necessarily the case but this is really     
1:01:53     
the logic that goes into modern neural networks because we're kind of use that sort of abstraction as a way to describe     
1:02:03     
like the units of a network and then those things are worked together so it's worth thinking that maybe he's wrong     
1:02:10     
maybe there are other things going on in the cell maybe there there are things that are going on in neural systems that     
1:02:17     
actually do play enough of a role to modify well it modifies it but it's how do     
1:02:24     
those relations affect the occurrence and of action potentials but     
1:02:30     
also information processing number nine developmental neurobiology     
1:02:38     
is a branch of general biology not of brain science as defined here     
1:02:43     
how do the fibers from the eye find their way to the optic tectum so this is a common issue in neurode development     
1:02:50     
where the eye is forming it's making its connection to the brain through the     
1:02:56     
optic tectum the answer to this question will tell us much about how the arteries     
1:03:01     
find their way into the kidney or the roots of a tree into the earth but very little about the problem of the analysis     
1:03:08     
of visual information in the optic detector so he actually doesn't think development     
1:03:14     
is particularly relevant to uh brain science in the sense of     
1:03:20     
information processing what's important is kind of the information processing as     
1:03:25     
it stands once that pathway gets established not as a function of that     
1:03:31     
pathway being established or I I should say rather that that pathway if it's established in different or aberant ways     
1:03:40     
can have an effect on information processing but the process of developmental     
1:03:46     
generation and um that whole thing is not relevant     
1:03:53     
information processing so it's an interesting distinction and you know     
1:03:58     
that's something if we're doing developmental bra vehicles um you know     
1:04:05     
that's something to think to kind of consider um a answer in some and I have     
1:04:10     
some answers for that but I'm not going to share them right now let's just say that I don't necessarily agree with this     
1:04:16     
point okay so 10 efficient research groups in brain science are small     
1:04:23     
everybody is groping for experimental techniques and for conceptual models if someone draws up a gigantic project in     
1:04:29     
order to solve the problem by brute force he is likely to have missed the complexity of the situation and is sure     
1:04:36     
to produce much waste so that's interesting that um they he     
1:04:42     
doesn't believe in huge interdisciplinary research projects necessarily he believes in these kind of     
1:04:49     
small brains you know brainoriented projects or maybe small interdisciplinary projects     
1:04:56     
i I don't know i kind of agree that like some of these very large research groups     
1:05:02     
sort of have more heat than light in a lot of ways i mean they publish these     
1:05:08     
huge papers that kind of overwhelm the field with data but what are they really discovering in those groups is it like     
1:05:16     
worth all of the you know all the hype i don't know i     
1:05:22     
mean small research groups have a role to play as well i guess that's the point is that the most efficient research     
1:05:28     
groups are probably small but you know that depends on what you're trying to do are you trying to map the brain or are     
1:05:35     
you trying to simulate the brain or are you trying to answer specific questions     
1:05:41     
to illustrate my points I want to mention some successes of modern brain science in its interaction with     
1:05:47     
information engineering so he makes a couple of points here uh the first is the paper by McCullen Pittz proposed an     
1:05:55     
equivalence between nets of neurons connected by synapses and propositions of boolean modules the terminology and     
1:06:03     
the diagrams of this paper were immediately taken over by the designers of calculating machines such as John     
1:06:09     
Monroyman and the basic ideas became the starting point for more than one theoretical development so this is both     
1:06:16     
automa theory which you know we we're familiar with from brain vehicles and also from modern computer science models     
1:06:24     
discrete models and shskin linguistics uh which is interesting     
1:06:31     
b is that some ideas were exchanged repeatedly two and four between brain     
1:06:37     
science and engineering the idea of the perceptron that was introduced by Rosenbomb     
1:06:43     
randomly connected image processor was inspired by neuroanatomy and neurohysiology     
1:06:50     
it has admirable technological consequences even today this is a paper     
1:06:55     
by Terry Senowski in 1987 received criticism on theoretical     
1:07:01     
grounds by Minsky and Selfridge who thought that a machine equipped with preset form detectors which is the     
1:07:08     
pandemonium network that um was proposed um     
1:07:15     
back then uh would be much more efficient so this is an interesting piece of work the pandemonium     
1:07:21     
machine this is uh basically something that uh inspired     
1:07:28     
neurohysiological work so pandemonium was kind of a neural network that had     
1:07:34     
different layers and the layers had different sort of it was almost like a brainberg vehicle i'll have to bring it     
1:07:41     
into the meeting at some point but it was quite an interesting model the early     
1:07:47     
model it didn't really pan out at least in terms of technologies but it's an     
1:07:53     
interesting um approach and this is not an embodied network this is actually resembling kind     
1:07:59     
of like a modern neural network or deep learning in any case this inspired work by uh Lethin and     
1:08:07     
others which turned into the seminal paper what the frog's eye tells the frog's brain and that was published in     
1:08:13     
1959 so this model pandemonium inspired this     
1:08:19     
model of behavior where you um basically the frog what happens is you have this     
1:08:27     
connection between the eye the visual system and the tongue that goes out and     
1:08:32     
captures flies and there has to be this tight connection between sensory and motor streams and what happens is you     
1:08:39     
can take the frog's eye and you can do a surgery where you rotate it 90 degrees     
1:08:44     
and if you rotate the eye 90 degrees the frog can no longer align its tongue with     
1:08:51     
the target that it's trying to get to so whereas the normal frog would be able to capture a fly with its tongue and make     
1:08:58     
that calculation of that angle it needs to project its tongue if you rotate the eye 90¬∞ the frog's     
1:09:08     
tongue is off of the target by 90¬∞ and it's it's just suggesting that     
1:09:14     
there's this sort of spatial um framework or this spatial schema that it     
1:09:21     
uses to make this mapping and then if you modify the the anatomy you also     
1:09:28     
modify the behavior by by offsetting that schema by     
1:09:35     
so it's really interesting um that's a famous paper it's interesting work     
1:09:40     
parallel to it in the same intellectual environment work on the cat and monkey visual cortex in the hands of Hubble and     
1:09:47     
we leasel produce splendid Nobel prizewinning results the Hubble and Wisel feature detectors in turn gave     
1:09:54     
engineers ideas which produced several efficient image processing devices so     
1:09:59     
this is theory informing technology theory informing experiments     
1:10:06     
c filter theory auto and crossorrelation generalized 4A analysis these are all     
1:10:12     
theoretical concepts developed in electronics um Reichard describes the results of his     
1:10:19     
and Hassenstein's experiments on optoot reactions and insects and in terms of uh     
1:10:27     
basically what was signal processing so having you know all of these tools     
1:10:33     
available to use not only as mathematical tools but metaphors was important for some of     
1:10:40     
these advances in neuroscience this is the first model of an animal behavior which made detailed predictions     
1:10:47     
on the neurological wiring underlying the behavior and the predictions were     
1:10:53     
anatomical the technological follow was a patent for a device designed to measure the     
1:10:59     
direction and velocity of a moving panorama and then D associative memory was     
1:11:06     
postulated by psychologists such as head wrote the initial paper on and then     
1:11:12     
people elaborated on later as a principle underlying cognition and behavior this idea turned into a variety     
1:11:20     
of mathematical models one of which the neural net of the hopefield kind is     
1:11:25     
hailed now as the cornerstone of a new age of computing technology it was shown that the statistics of     
1:11:31     
connections within the cerebral cortex and this is a paper brainber and shoods     
1:11:37     
in 1991 best be explained as being specialized for associative memory     
1:11:43     
so there was a statistical study that they did within cerebral cortex and kind of getting this connection to being sort     
1:11:52     
of evolved for associative memory showing the evidence for that     
1:11:58     
the global states of activity with which the hope field theory postulates a sort of resonant modes or ien states of the     
1:12:05     
cortex has been shown with computer analysis of multiple electric recordings     
1:12:11     
and that's um what they now that was sort of the     
1:12:17     
state-of-the-art I guess in I don't know when this manifesto was written but it     
1:12:23     
definitely goes up to the 1990s okay     
1:12:30     
all right so that's good um so that is all I have on that um some     
1:12:37     
really interesting stuff from about Valentina Bradenberg and I I I like to     
1:12:43     
revisit that because you know history is always good to see where we've been and     
1:12:48     
see what some of these intellectual connections are okay so yeah let me look in the chat     
1:12:55     
here um yes uh BD thank you for showing up today um Jess says "Sensor to aector     
1:13:03     
versus digestion is interesting." Yes yeah it is um I don't know well I mean I     
1:13:08     
don't know what to make of it in the sense of like the question I posed but     
1:13:14     
generally you know those are input output systems and um yeah we don't     
1:13:19     
typically think of that in terms of information processing obviously well I     
1:13:24     
say obviously because we don't But you could have an information theoretic     
1:13:29     
theory of digestion i don't know um it makes maybe as much sense as the brain     
1:13:36     
because we kind of think of information because it generates behavior and it gener that generates information so we     
1:13:43     
think about in terms of information theory but we could just as easily just think about the brain in terms of     
1:13:49     
physiology and be fine I guess um Okay yeah so it's and then of course your     
1:13:56     
digestive system has a mini gut which is a a small brain right so there's     
1:14:02     
information processing there anyways um     
1:14:08     
and then gi for joining late I was not aware of the meeting link okay well thank you yeah please come into the     
1:14:15     
meetings anytime this is a nice meeting there's a lot of crossover between here and evil so     
1:14:23     
okay Um so if we want to do updates now I think     
1:14:28     
this is probably the time i know Jesse and Morgan had updates i     
1:14:34     
can share a few things okay but um if anyone else wants to go first they can     
1:14:41     
um otherwise I'll just start i I I don't     
1:14:46     
have any um uh like in-depth presentations but I'll     
1:14:57     
I'll um just briefly     
1:15:03     
share this excuse me yeah um     
1:15:11     
so this week I attended these three events basically     
1:15:19     
and they're all the common theme is um     
1:15:26     
but also um Addie was in town and Luca Luka Delo was just I actually wish I had     
1:15:33     
more time here on Thursday because um for this one     
1:15:39     
you know you can see the QRI folks are there um I really enjoyed Monica     
1:15:46     
Sanford's talk too which I I I mostly mentioned yesterday in terms of sort of     
1:15:51     
Buddhist pedagogy and communities and teaching and development and there's a lot of like you know very interesting     
1:15:57     
things here um and and sort of this applied space of     
1:16:05     
you know um     
1:16:10     
f future meditation well-being mental health and then     
1:16:16     
mindfulness one of the slight many many many things one one sort of minor thing     
1:16:22     
that I took away from the event was how much you So     
1:16:30     
in the the current term mindfulness is is     
1:16:36     
being seen as the way to talk about some things particularly here in the United States     
1:16:42     
because you know yoga sort of has a more if you tell people you're you're if you     
1:16:48     
tell people in like public spaces that high school think oh we're doing we're doing yoga that that has a little too     
1:16:54     
much of religious connotation so mindfulness can be a way um     
1:17:02     
of of getting at at at what that is in terms of practices so that was that was     
1:17:07     
interesting to see and sort of there was a very interesting set of questions about like how do you how do we     
1:17:12     
disseminate the what the the fruits of these things that come up through yeah     
1:17:18     
they have kind of have you know background in um     
1:17:25     
these sort of more religious communities and and bringing that from there so that's one thing uh but all but that     
1:17:31     
really wasn't the main focus of the event there's just a minor point that popped out me here the event itself was     
1:17:37     
specifically um     
1:17:42     
I was I was trying to find I'm trying to find a     
1:17:48     
like a screenshot from it that I have somewhere um     
1:17:54     
so just one little second     
1:18:05     
Yeah um I can't seem to find it so I'll I'll     
1:18:11     
just I'll just try to um I might come back to it later actually     
1:18:17     
but it was very I I wish I wish I could have stayed to some some more of the events there was sort of a workshop and     
1:18:22     
some other things but uh my Thursday got had a lot of things come up into it but     
1:18:29     
shout out to that um um I appreciate uh Luca is sort of the     
1:18:36     
um this Lucas with meditation artifacts and     
1:18:43     
they're uh they're trying to to do some interesting things and and sort of the     
1:18:49     
the interesting point for me is like how as we're as we're building you know technology and innovating things and     
1:18:56     
building new platforms which is sort of a part of     
1:19:02     
particularly this this this event um but as we're building these these new things     
1:19:08     
like how do we deal with it like we've had many we've had some conversations here about uh present shock as sort of     
1:19:16     
the you know the the successor to future shock and present shots shocks pressure     
1:19:23     
on um attention oh yeah that's right um on attention and     
1:19:32     
um like gizophrenia and and all the notifications and screens and and     
1:19:39     
different like unfathomable ways to     
1:19:46     
just have all this information and these pulls on you uh put put into the system     
1:19:51     
and how that affects many other things unfathomable to like you know     
1:19:59     
bi biological life is quite grand to say this but at least     
1:20:06     
at least how how humans evolved uh certainly didn't have the the the     
1:20:13     
competition or um the need to discern     
1:20:20     
at this level uh signal from noise basically and I had     
1:20:26     
a very interesting conversation yesterday around this topic um because     
1:20:32     
you know this it was it was it was quite related to um     
1:20:38     
you know what I just said in terms of um     
1:20:44     
the present shock basically and it demands attention and and there's the famous quote I heard I heard by who was     
1:20:51     
by the bas relating um you know as we have more and more and more information the the thing that     
1:20:58     
information you consumes or or or not consumes but um     
1:21:05     
takes away from is is attention so this sort of we have more information less attention less things our ability to     
1:21:11     
focus on all of it diminishes so you know more information available less     
1:21:17     
attention to give to all the information the allocation of it changes and you     
1:21:23     
know I I was having this conversation in discussion yesterday with with a colleague and     
1:21:30     
One thing that came from the conversation that I'm actually quite interested in exploring more is     
1:21:35     
um     
1:21:40     
never has there been such a necessity this is a bit of a lofty statement but     
1:21:46     
I'll just put it in lofty terms never has there been such such an     
1:21:52     
a necessity for humans and you know society right now you have     
1:21:59     
to uh disassociate you have to very     
1:22:05     
intentionally not look at things you you must filter out you cannot you have you     
1:22:12     
have this you know and I I I we made this point many times here but I I     
1:22:18     
always try to find new ways to articulate the following statement you know which is you have this thing in     
1:22:24     
your hand that is a a user interface     
1:22:31     
that is this combined heavily distilled     
1:22:37     
heavily tailored cycle psychological manipulation     
1:22:44     
uh device like like the fruit of cognitive science psychology psychiatry behavioral studies unfortunately is is     
1:22:52     
in is contained in this delicious appealing handheld device and and also     
1:22:59     
on online too the recommend recommendation stuff this this extremely it's it it's like a     
1:23:07     
it's it's not just an inanimate object that has no intelligence in it like     
1:23:13     
there's baked in intelligence into your cell phone example your smartphone     
1:23:19     
that has a tremendous amount of pull right on on your attention so we all     
1:23:28     
know this here but but I try to find new ways to to bring this up because I don't think you'll realize like     
1:23:36     
um people always say "Oh you know you're interested in cognitive science or psychology that's that's pretty far     
1:23:41     
removed or stuff like that." And like well all the all all the really heavily applied stuff has been subsumed by     
1:23:48     
basically marketing or or or you know these higher and higher and     
1:23:53     
higher level really deeply psychologically targeted like manipulation like it's it's manipulation     
1:23:59     
to get you to do something to get you to be spend a little bit more screen time on the app etc etc so we have this and     
1:24:08     
sort of this requisite this this this alternate component is this disassociation right this tuning out     
1:24:15     
this sense of you know I I shouldn't pay attention to this I don't want to pay attention to     
1:24:21     
this I want to forget about that I want to focus pleasantly on something else I don't want to be distracted I don't want     
1:24:26     
I don't want to be pulled in these things and so the disassociation     
1:24:32     
the tuning out the filtering is one thing     
1:24:37     
and what I was talking about yesterday in particular was how     
1:24:44     
it it um I use a term which I'm I'm I'm not quite     
1:24:51     
happy for i'm not I'm not settled with but I think it was it was it was provoc     
1:24:56     
it was more of a provocative term than or a phrase that came up     
1:25:03     
um than something I'm I'm finalized on but it was sort of like this necessity     
1:25:08     
of micro doing on apathy in the sense that it's a small quantity     
1:25:16     
or like you know the little bit of the poison that acts as a cure where you just don't care about stuff And there's     
1:25:22     
a fine line between getting rest between tuning out between not caring um because     
1:25:29     
I think you know I'm I'm particularly I don't want to say anti-appathy but um     
1:25:36     
I think I think there's tremendous amount of pressure on the wolves to to be empathetic about things anyway so     
1:25:42     
where am I going with this is that the the conclusion of the conversation was realizing so you have like there's     
1:25:49     
there's a there's a legitimate need now in a way that has never perhaps existed before to this degree of you have to     
1:25:56     
psychologically press some you have to have some control     
1:26:03     
and the ability to filter or tune off or tune out and that's great but     
1:26:10     
uh how do you come back from that i used another analogy of     
1:26:19     
uh like if you're exploring a cave or like there's a big storm coming and you happen to be in the woods or walking by     
1:26:25     
a cave or you know some some some sort of an unknown unexplored structure that     
1:26:31     
you're you're not that familiar with and to to not get blown away you you seek     
1:26:36     
refuge inside the cave right you go inside here and it's like you can go in     
1:26:41     
there and get lost uh even if the storm is very intense like you might need to to go inside and     
1:26:48     
you know maybe the ideal thing to do is to bring some rope or tether or some other you know market trail breadcrumbs     
1:26:55     
or so on so that way you can come back out when the storm passes and I feel     
1:27:00     
like what we kind of got at in the discussion was     
1:27:06     
this the storm is sort of analogous to you know the present shock pressures uh     
1:27:12     
and the the the the cave is analogous to you know seeking some kind of     
1:27:18     
disassociation but it's like the process of going back or or or renewing your attention     
1:27:25     
is is very you know interesting and it's like how do you have these landmarks how     
1:27:32     
do you have how do you how do you come back to being fully involved and what what to pursue so sort of this juggling     
1:27:38     
of meaning this juggling of direction both metaphorically and kind of literally like where how do you go where     
1:27:46     
do you do it and I think this is sort of this is a very long-winded way of trying to get it like a rough draft past of it     
1:27:52     
but but I think there's very much something here to this this process of having to seek the shelter from this     
1:27:58     
storm of of all the things that's going on or society or news politics whatever you want to say at different levels but     
1:28:05     
then also acknowledging the need to seek some kind of shelter or defense but then     
1:28:12     
but then when when it's safe or attainable to do so not just being in this cave     
1:28:22     
you know darkness and complete disassociation and I think I know this is a bit um     
1:28:29     
grand and lofty perhaps like a very very sort of macro societal technological     
1:28:35     
discussion and scale thing here but I think it's it's it's it's relevant in the sense that there's a lot of um     
1:28:44     
uh pressure to do so and a lot of incentivization of oh we're all going to     
1:28:51     
disassociate and and things are going to happen and sort of like path of least resistance about certain things and     
1:28:59     
whether or not those paths are correct um or or the way things go is maybe less     
1:29:08     
that's also important to essentially demarcate uh the means for choosing other things     
1:29:15     
um so I I'll leave I'll leave that um as     
1:29:20     
sort of a nice philosophical uh piece I guess to pick up on later     
1:29:29     
um the other two events I wanted to mention this week were this this is at a     
1:29:34     
lab augmentation lab i attended this one directly for most of the whole main event uh with William Han who's at FAU     
1:29:43     
perception condition robotics laboratory he came to town with Addie of Ecolapto     
1:29:49     
um it was an interesting thing there was there was um     
1:29:56     
I actually don't feel even though I was there I don't know how to best um     
1:30:03     
recap it it was kind of just a large wine breaking set of discussions it's quite nebulous it was like one of our     
1:30:09     
one of our big freestyle sessions they discussed     
1:30:14     
um some some common things about uh language and and and     
1:30:20     
synthesia and um you know the classic echolapto     
1:30:26     
topics william Han also talks about like infohazards and and a lot of the not     
1:30:32     
just in in the case of what I was just saying like oh like you have to disassociate um Han talks somewhat about     
1:30:38     
um almost like like spy spyw wear or or     
1:30:43     
malware that that gets into um     
1:30:49     
your your mind and and sort of creates these um hyperorganisms was for for     
1:30:56     
broader things but like um I forgot what they were called but but sort of things     
1:31:01     
that help perpetuate certain you know thoughts or um me like mental structures     
1:31:07     
that give way to things i don't I feel not totally able to let's do this     
1:31:18     
do that i don't have a great recap for this just because now that I when I think about this right now I was like     
1:31:23     
wow we really covered a lot of ground but it's a nice it's a very nice discussion um OGLab is uh     
1:31:31     
Addie Add's involved in OGLab too and I'm not going to be able to share this     
1:31:36     
very well um     
1:31:42     
here we go ugl Web is a very cool um transitionary philosopher builders uh     
1:31:48     
they have a residency um I think that was Yeah they there's a very interesting set of people here     
1:31:55     
they're also involved in this hacker house in in earliest the event was held at a sort of hacker house i think it's     
1:32:01     
called um Harvard Street Commons now used to be like sea house or something     
1:32:06     
like that and um     
1:32:16     
it was you know it was an it was a nice sort of informal     
1:32:21     
well it was formal but um     
1:32:27     
It was it was just a nice free brain discussion and it was hosted by um DA of     
1:32:32     
the Harvard of the um at OG lab and I think that's done here actually on the     
1:32:38     
left and um just a very cool a cool scene of     
1:32:44     
people trying to do and build stuff and and and a lot of innovation there da is     
1:32:49     
with um just shut this     
1:32:59     
hope yeah I think it uh sorry     
1:33:06     
uh yeah here we go um yeah Da Da's really     
1:33:15     
cool she's with the MIT Media Lab at least with Patty May for yeah fluid interfaces so um I'm very curious to you     
1:33:26     
know talk talk to her more and find you know we went through interfaces here somewhat     
1:33:32     
often so um that'll be a nice opportunity to um     
1:33:39     
follow up with that um and then finally I'll briefly talk about this other topic     
1:33:45     
which uh has an interesting title cultural computers i'm not sure that's     
1:33:50     
entirely I mean I guess this what we talked about but let me see if there's anything here     
1:33:57     
no uh but it was a very interesting discussion in terms of     
1:34:03     
um how ideas develop niche versus mainstream     
1:34:10     
uh culture uh Ronald Ronald G um is is     
1:34:16     
making I think he's making a um     
1:34:22     
I guess sort of like a dating app right now but but he's much more interested in creating these new substrates for um     
1:34:30     
people to connect and do things and recognizing how your current social media will eventually change and there     
1:34:36     
sort of a greater um a greater opportunity to connect with people as     
1:34:43     
the boundaries for interaction decrease and opportunities to engage have new and     
1:34:48     
unique spaces or people of of who want to pursue different things can have like very very very niche collected um     
1:34:58     
um like discussions but then the barrier of going into that that niche collective     
1:35:04     
discussion and and going back out to the tudical mainstream with the rest like other broader community the movement     
1:35:10     
between those things as at least as hard as we'll talk about we we talked about a     
1:35:16     
few days ago uh the movement between those spaces maybe may uh change like     
1:35:22     
the ability to translate between very niche topics and other other communities     
1:35:29     
or the languages may change now I think an interesting way to think about that is also um     
1:35:40     
you can translate in terms of a language but translating in terms of context     
1:35:46     
and in terms of depth of association I think is not     
1:35:53     
necessarily the same thing as just translating the language and I I mentioned a long time ago I think I     
1:36:00     
think I may be able to pull this up quickly     
1:36:06     
um a long long time ago at     
1:36:13     
Robot um     
1:36:18     
yeah this this works um I I um     
1:36:25     
picture of the poster here or not i presented on     
1:36:31     
this idea of find it here maybe this in this picture     
1:36:39     
um yeah yeah well here's one on on virtual Liz and digital companionship which was     
1:36:44     
sort of a precursor to a lot of the chat bots now but also communities and then     
1:36:49     
also um towards share a cognitive environment yeah that's the one I was looking for and so you know I'm I'm very     
1:36:57     
interested in in the process of of how do you share yes translating between     
1:37:02     
languages one thing having having an app space that that helps with it um is another uh and and the actual technical     
1:37:10     
infrastructure but then also how do you even     
1:37:16     
I'm very I'm very cautious about like the mind uploading stuff or like the downloading oh I know kung fu in the     
1:37:22     
matrix I I I don't that just gives me so much pause and it's it's a wonderful     
1:37:29     
exciting thing for people to think about and I'm I'm not averse to it but I feel     
1:37:34     
like to do it in a respectful to to approach it in a respectful way you'd     
1:37:43     
a really important precursor would be illust like I know I'm biased and then I     
1:37:50     
reference frontier map but also be like the first step would be earnestly demarcating     
1:37:56     
you know where um where these sort of inflection points are or the path that     
1:38:02     
that you chose but why why are you highlighting these paths of importance     
1:38:07     
or significance in a field of study or in your experience or relation to them relative to others is sort of like     
1:38:13     
pointing out the the the decision structure or the decision tree or in the     
1:38:18     
almost like in the um in like the tailtale game series you know RPG things     
1:38:24     
where it's like oh somebody will remember Jesse will remember this choice that you made or that Jesse's going to     
1:38:31     
be angry about this in the future like like like sort of not just instant downloaded from your standard but more     
1:38:37     
can you download the context of your decision so the information has structure and scaffolding that's     
1:38:43     
attached to other things like I think that's I don't I don't I'm sure people are talking about that but I I find it     
1:38:49     
to be another part of it and anyway at any rate um to come back out and and kind of     
1:38:56     
wrap this up and getting to the end here I um I I I really enjoyed this this talk um     
1:39:04     
it was informal it was last minute it it was kind of like not even a it was it     
1:39:10     
was a tough environment because it was just in we had to move it because it was hot out and and change locations so we     
1:39:16     
did it in the um I don't have any pictures but maybe next week I will I     
1:39:22     
will I will share them um we we did it at the like the 10th floor     
1:39:29     
of the Smith Center which is a student center and it's kind of like it was didn't lounge so was it was like noisy     
1:39:35     
for a while um in in Harvard Square uh but it but but     
1:39:42     
as the conversation went on like it got really juicy at the end and I think I think that part was recorded so I'm sure     
1:39:48     
once it's on I think it'll be on Echoloft's website we'll come back to it because I think there's a lot of really     
1:39:53     
cool stuff relative to both condition futures and society ethics tech topics     
1:39:59     
that we've talked about before and um yeah I'm looking forward to to kind of     
1:40:06     
getting some of the bigger picture with uh who who is sort of the the creator     
1:40:12     
that we're talking about with adding everybody else so yeah um I will leave     
1:40:19     
it there if there's any comments but if not I know I talked a bit so we     
1:40:26     
can other things well thank you Jesse that was great um a     
1:40:35     
lot of things going on there and a lot of uh pathy statements and big ideas and     
1:40:40     
all these things in between so um yeah I like the some things that were going on     
1:40:46     
there um the whole idea about bringing social coordination into social media like     
1:40:53     
formal theories of social coordination or designing it around more formal     
1:40:59     
mechanisms of social coordination I guess is maybe the better way to put it     
1:41:05     
i don't know like what you know when say Facebook was designed or whatever what the theory i     
1:41:12     
mean there wasn't a theory behind it I guess is my point right or Twitter um     
1:41:18     
well modern Twitter might be like a theory of malevolence but um other than     
1:41:23     
that you know it's like what are the theories that are informing the design of these large scale tools i mean we     
1:41:30     
know a lot about well we know something about uh coordinated behavior but it's like     
1:41:36     
how do you incorporate that into the technology right you know like if we have like uh     
1:41:43     
swarm intelligence techniques that can like you know help assist     
1:41:48     
people in collective behaviors or preventing certain collective behaviors from     
1:41:54     
happening and I think you know kind of what I'm getting at with that um but     
1:42:00     
yeah I mean it's definitely useful and looks like you want to bring     
1:42:07     
Well I I think it's just there's been so much good conversation recently on     
1:42:13     
like I think one of the fun things to talk about here is a sort of     
1:42:18     
like this kind of AI governance like we previously talking about social media right and and just communication and     
1:42:26     
sort of maybe the digital commons or how is how is digital communication technology     
1:42:31     
uh forums you know apps how these communities even like in-game communities like Minecraft communities     
1:42:37     
or MMR PG games things like that it's it     
1:42:42     
you know but then also like there's a really interesting set of discussion I'm not going to go in depth here but     
1:42:50     
how are you structuring the um the government or the governance     
1:42:57     
around these things um and how how are you I think so much like     
1:43:05     
mechanistically like are you are you creating something that is driven by     
1:43:10     
trying to get hits or likes you know the the current platforms we have very much     
1:43:15     
put a pressure on commodification of you know your output and your viewership     
1:43:21     
like like you're everybody now you know everybody now is is is content creator     
1:43:28     
like you have to be I'm other I'm just going to sidestep certain conversations about content     
1:43:34     
creating because it's such a     
1:43:39     
point point being you have to put you have to have a certain intentionality     
1:43:46     
if you want if you want to share your voice or find people you kind of can't you can't just uh you can't just say "Oh     
1:43:53     
here's here's the link." Like you you're so incentivized to make     
1:43:58     
something appealing that will work in the media channels that you're trying to do so that's all social stuff but     
1:44:06     
there's also this other side of the the coin which is still mechanistically driven about you know how are you going     
1:44:13     
to create these structures for interaction like this the the um     
1:44:22     
the gov lab project here future digital democracy is all about you know this this topic at a governance level um I     
1:44:29     
was at the I don't know if I can get um     
1:44:35     
Uh     
1:44:41     
I mean this is this is this is you know this is super quick reference to what we do before but the habus machine is it's     
1:44:50     
another process of like consensus finding and and and can I can AI help humans find common     
1:44:57     
grounds in in democratic deliberation like I think this is very much a question of what that's     
1:45:05     
I I don't know if this is where you're going this or not and I I'll return it directly to you and you can you can say     
1:45:12     
uh but like you know I think I think it's such an interesting     
1:45:20     
theoretical discussion but I'm even more like I'm really interested and I I     
1:45:25     
really want to do work in the spaces of how are people attempting to build out     
1:45:32     
these things because I I feel like we're in such a a space of     
1:45:40     
potential and ideas that oh yeah AI and GPT can just do it and and so     
1:45:47     
there's still there's still a need to to have     
1:45:53     
uh to to to have a sense of direction about how to build out the stuff you we want to do and I I I'll sort of hand     
1:46:00     
hand the mic back to you with this but saying um I'm curious if you wanted to if you were     
1:46:07     
just sort of I'm curious if you wanted to say more about that or you kind of were just thinking on the fly about building in     
1:46:14     
the mechanisms of of really these new social structures or new platforms or     
1:46:20     
apps and where I don't know anything more you wanted to say about that yes uh     
1:46:27     
yeah I mean just pointing out that like um you know I know there people who     
1:46:35     
have worked on like some of these tools that you can build into     
1:46:40     
you know social media other and so like you know you have AI tools you have     
1:46:46     
other types of moderation tools that people developed for specific uses and     
1:46:52     
what I was talking about before about theory was like designing an entire platform is based on like a theory of     
1:46:59     
collective behavior whether that's the way actually people are actually interacting is not kind of I mean maybe     
1:47:06     
that that has some shortcomings or or theories of collective behavior might be lacking um so you know applying theory     
1:47:14     
to to practice is hard but getting like uh sort of having a big uh picture view     
1:47:22     
of you know what the system should look like what you should expect and maybe     
1:47:28     
you can't predict a lot of the things that happen we know from like a large human collective behavior that a lot of     
1:47:36     
so spontaneous social events are not predictable in the conventional way and so you know being able to use that     
1:47:42     
theory to sort of inform how the tools are implemented on those platforms is kind of an interesting thing i wouldn't     
1:47:49     
say that like that's something that you could go and and build tomorrow which is     
1:47:54     
like build a tool like or build a platform like that but but it's it's worth thinking about how you might go     
1:48:00     
about doing it so it's kind of more of a you know a theoretical space where okay     
1:48:06     
we want we have these theories about collective behavior we kind of have some tools for moderation and modern social     
1:48:14     
networks we know something about network theory and emergence and all these things how do we bring that together to     
1:48:21     
maybe build something that's really useful and     
1:48:26     
um you know has the affordances that we need as interactors in this platform     
1:48:36     
i think as as a as a kind of u add-on thought to that I just thought it would     
1:48:43     
be real interesting i don't know when 20 years     
1:48:49     
um or or so uh who knows but like it     
1:48:55     
feels like I'm I'm going to talk about one social network and I'm talking about classic Facebook and I mean Facebook     
1:49:02     
relative not not meta not what they're trying to do with it but like Facebook as it was um     
1:49:10     
uh Q the Harry Styles song like as it was in the sense of     
1:49:18     
exactly what you said about it originally it was sort of you know Mark Zuckerberg or he stole the idea or     
1:49:24     
whatever of um you know oh I want to make this like social network and you can have free page and blah blah but     
1:49:34     
when will classic Facebook be     
1:49:40     
put to put to rest as in like like um     
1:49:45     
you know like I guess I think MySpace still exists right i don't I don't remember but it's like these these old     
1:49:51     
precursor networks that are just totally dumb um and and I guess there's an if because     
1:49:58     
the thing about Facebook I think we all know this is like Facebook is a     
1:50:05     
platform but it also is like what it what it really is is a is a data     
1:50:11     
repository and is a way to get data on all these people all these interactions     
1:50:17     
all these you know the Cambridge Analytica the testing and and you know     
1:50:23     
we we talk about there was some recent thing about AI uh like manipulation on     
1:50:29     
on Reddit to see how people change their mind with you know interventions and and and so on and it's like yeah but like I     
1:50:36     
me I'm mentioning Facebook here specifically because Facebook kind of is this for those of us around I think when     
1:50:43     
it came about and I wasn't I wasn't an early adopter by any means um but it was a I mean it still is going     
1:50:52     
strong obviously in it it's it's evolves in its target and use case but Facebook     
1:50:59     
as a when will that way of seeing sort of a     
1:51:05     
classic I guess classic now social media platform     
1:51:10     
be totally obsolete like Facebook right now is sort of     
1:51:16     
it exists but like very few very few of the discussions that I have that are     
1:51:21     
really significant happened there however there are still groups that are very much churning out things because of     
1:51:29     
just a couple you know big names or a couple meaningful conversations are still ongoing there obviously and and     
1:51:37     
I'm not I'm not poo pooing oh Facebook but more a sense of     
1:51:44     
I'm curious what what it will be like when what will sort of be the narrative     
1:51:49     
when you know oh Facebook doesn't exist anymore what the way that it used to and     
1:51:56     
how are these other platforms going to be developed and that was part of the um that was a     
1:52:04     
little bit of what um this conversation was about essentially     
1:52:09     
is where as as the as the trends continue and the barriers for for for     
1:52:16     
these things change you know will will there how will sort of maybe fundamental     
1:52:24     
human inclinations to find people like you and have more in-depth discussions about very niche you know about topics     
1:52:30     
that that you want to have how will that affect um affect things like you like I think     
1:52:38     
just to kind of play this out for one more second like you're not going to need to make a Facebook group anymore to     
1:52:43     
find people talk talk to you and have niche discussions around that topic what does that look like when there's a     
1:52:49     
different macro platform like one of the things that came up in the discussion was Instagram and Facebook we didn't see     
1:52:55     
say Facebook but like Instagram or Twitter or Reddit you know they may not     
1:53:01     
exist the way that they do in maybe even very soon but at least maybe 10 or 20     
1:53:06     
years they they the nature of interfacing with people information and ideas in that way may     
1:53:13     
change a lot so you know where does that go and then to Brad Barley's point about um you know trying to bake in some     
1:53:20     
theories and ideas into enabling stuff um we'll see it's an exciting space for     
1:53:27     
sure that yeah it's great um yeah it's     
1:53:32     
definitely think something to think about more yeah well thanks for the update Jesse     
1:53:40     
that's good um maybe one other brief thing before I end before I forget it is     
1:53:45     
like I did mention some like uh like leadership discussion talks we talked about your project management course i'm     
1:53:51     
also looking at um I'll say over this in Slack the picture but uh and looking at     
1:53:57     
places to basically put either an actual like academic paper or     
1:54:02     
just sort of professional articles to talk about it too so if you have anything like that feel free to put it     
1:54:08     
in Slack somewhere but I'm I'm kind of turning out a lot of things there i'm very open to collaborating on that if     
1:54:14     
anybody wants to write those kind of articles that's all     
1:54:20     
all right thank you Jesse um I don't know if anyone else had any     
1:54:25     
questions before we move on or any other comments     
1:54:34     
i could probably comment on some of the I mean at least the echalopto     
1:54:40     
here one second let me just switch over     
1:54:53     
hello hi okay um yeah so I mean I've I've also been     
1:55:01     
attending uh those meetings when when possible um and you know there's     
1:55:11     
interesting discussions uh I think we've we've had some visitors here at the     
1:55:17     
tower from uh or that are associated with augmentation lab and I would definitely     
1:55:24     
love to to follow up on that as they are planning some sort of um     
1:55:32     
I think they're calling it human enhancement conference or     
1:55:38     
something um so you know I I absolutely     
1:55:45     
um support that kind of work um when it's practical um what I I don't have     
1:55:54     
time for is people talking about how cool it will be when we can upload stuff     
1:55:59     
like in the Matrix and it's like I'd kind of just prefer to watch clips from     
1:56:05     
the Matrix uh     
1:56:10     
yeah and uh and unfortunately that comes up way too much     
1:56:16     
or like like it it's you know Yeah     
1:56:21     
i think I've I think I've ranted about whole brain emulation before just in terms of you know it's kind of it's     
1:56:30     
light on the it's light on the biotech and heavy on the the sci-fi discussion     
1:56:37     
and um so I I I attended it was deep tech     
1:56:43     
week here in San Francisco and that means uh a lot of events     
1:56:50     
uh you you get a certain bump by doing     
1:56:56     
an event this week i think there's a lot of cross     
1:57:01     
crossing and um anyway it's a great great time to certainly uh put together     
1:57:08     
a headline event um because you can get     
1:57:14     
in a lot of people uh a lot of people are here to see Deep Tech and um you     
1:57:21     
know but uh again the the the     
1:57:26     
neurot meetings things were extremely light on tech and extremely heavy on     
1:57:35     
I don't know I guess um networking and     
1:57:40     
talking about uh I mean you know it was like this wonderful UCSF professor who     
1:57:46     
does incredible biology work and her talk was was about humans 2.0     
1:57:54     
Okay and and you know     
1:58:00     
it's like so you know but there was no no discussion of how we would you know     
1:58:05     
this wasn't a crisper discussion she was she was working on a working on an     
1:58:10     
interesting um uh alil where you have very short sleep and and     
1:58:20     
in general are very healthy so sleep five hours a day but     
1:58:27     
uh you don't have any of the health uh problems that would be associated     
1:58:35     
with sleeping five hours a day if you weren't a short sleeper you know um     
1:58:43     
uh but so interesting in the sense of what your physiology is actually capable     
1:58:50     
of right uh so I I would have loved it     
1:58:56     
to be a uh get get into biology 2.0     
1:59:03     
pitch you know like like this is why you should all study biology kids um anyway     
1:59:11     
but it's it seemed to be more like yeah this is this is why you should fund or     
1:59:19     
this is why you should be interested in a wellness clinic um uh yeah one one     
1:59:26     
talk that was it was an interesting approach it was like I didn't put together a talk but here's the outline     
1:59:33     
of what I would be talking about which I thought was really interesting     
1:59:39     
i gota gonna have to do that sometime um but uh the     
1:59:47     
let's see um uh Thursday was interesting so the the Med art group so I don't know     
1:59:53     
if you remember this group uh they came together i don't know if this is kind of     
1:59:59     
like pandemic related but like a group of of uh or I think it was like     
2:00:07     
stability back back when stability was a beam um and     
2:00:15     
you know everything seemed possible um and apparently they had plenty of of     
2:00:22     
funding for community building um they put together Medarkc which was like     
2:00:27     
let's you know even though we're kind of like gener generative uh image company     
2:00:34     
um we can do neuro imaging analysis and um I forget what the guy's name Paul     
2:00:42     
Scotty anyway there was they had a head of neuro imaging     
2:00:48     
and so that that was that was definitely an interesting meeting um where     
2:00:57     
they've formed a new team or a lot of like former metarch people together with cogn people are trying to do the same     
2:01:05     
thing with EEG um I I I think it's pretty funny     
2:01:11     
you know like like back back when Medarkc was focus forming I I said like     
2:01:17     
"Hey we should do ET or like who's interested in ET projects and like there's this child mind institute     
2:01:23     
healthy brain network data set." Um we should use that right um no nobody was     
2:01:28     
interested and uh this year of course that Nurex is doing an EEG challenge     
2:01:35     
that's based on the the human brain network     
2:01:41     
and uh so yeah anyway I I thought that     
2:01:46     
was pretty funny um uh they you know an     
2:01:52     
interesting you know it's it's an interesting approach they've got a great science team uh in the sense of like the     
2:02:00     
the people yeah their their adviserss or people     
2:02:06     
behind the big software projects that everybody uses for EG processing um I     
2:02:13     
still don't know what happens if you manage to make this work in terms of     
2:02:18     
like still not sure what the product is it's like okay so EEG you can tell what     
2:02:27     
kind of picture I'm looking at or you know maybe what I'm thinking     
2:02:35     
but anyway I'll leave that to the the bright people in Silicon Valley     
2:02:41     
um but it was an interesting opportunity to meet with like for some reason like     
2:02:49     
you know half the people there were from Neurolink so I got to talk to some some Neuralink     
2:02:56     
people and yeah that was kind of cool just in terms of talking about um just     
2:03:03     
give doing a bit more Neuroch X marketing or yeah and and talking about     
2:03:11     
the the project to try and make recording neurons you know culturing     
2:03:16     
neurons and recording them uh a you know student accessible undergraduate     
2:03:22     
accessible whole project and so it was nice last night we did our seventh     
2:03:28     
wetware meeting here in the tower this is the biopunk labs um opportunity you     
2:03:35     
know kind of mixer plus come and talk about what projects you're working on um     
2:03:40     
so that was cool and uh again like some of those Nurling people came to to visit     
2:03:46     
the tower and got show them around which was nice um and yeah I I was using our     
2:03:55     
our colonel donated device to uh do brain age measures     
2:04:02     
so with just a little seven minute resting scan u u you know it it seems it     
2:04:09     
seems to make people happy uh you know we're kind of just adding to colonel's data collection     
2:04:17     
uh but I would like to take the I would like to turn the device on get my most     
2:04:22     
recent MRI scans which we we just did with a company here in the new     
2:04:28     
psychiatry scanner it's got like the you know supposed to be like the strongest gradient system in North America so it's     
2:04:36     
which allows you to do some some at least diffusion scans that are super high res super high signal     
2:04:44     
um uh yeah anyway it would be nice to put     
2:04:50     
together a demo but uh this weekend just hoping to get more progress on the mind     
2:04:57     
in vitro project or like like our our instantiation of it and or you know     
2:05:07     
I mean I wouldn't even say instantiation although we we what we'll do with carne     
2:05:12     
will hopefully be learning about what what we could add to the project um but     
2:05:19     
at this point we just want to roll this out to student clubs so I've got um I've     
2:05:26     
got cell culture undergrad cell culture people coming to talk about Yeah like     
2:05:34     
like what what's kind of like our minimum     
2:05:39     
requirements for uh a student group to get involved in terms of just you know     
2:05:46     
we try to make it such that uh they do need you know they need wet lab space in     
2:05:54     
the sense of just you know reagents and and etc but what     
2:06:00     
we want to try and do is try and make it as self-contained as possible where a PI     
2:06:06     
would be willing to give a little bit of bench space but like we won't have to we     
2:06:14     
want to minimize the interactions of those undergrads with the wet labs     
2:06:19     
ongoing projects right so like like anyway so um yeah so trying to um     
2:06:31     
Yeah so it was it was nice to to we've got a a collaborator on the east coast     
2:06:39     
that's working at Genpace which is the New York Bolab community bolab that that     
2:06:45     
we're kind of inspired by or you know Elliot used to teach at     
2:06:51     
um uh but we're trying to recognize these kind of human elements to this kind this     
2:07:00     
adoption in terms of just you know like like why why is it hard for undergrads     
2:07:07     
to do this kind of biology work you know and     
2:07:12     
and one of those things is is like it's hard to get access to a web lab web     
2:07:18     
because they don't want people coming in and messing up their experiments yeah exactly     
2:07:26     
and and so you know just trying to think about how to make that     
2:07:31     
uh as as as I mean you know being being as as as     
2:07:38     
considerate and and taking into consideration these uh the that problem     
2:07:45     
um but but again still really Yeah happy with it and happy with     
2:07:52     
the possibilities that we have with this this combo 3D biorinting opportunity     
2:08:00     
that next month it should be yeah really really interesting and last night you     
2:08:07     
know so again like it's great to be doing biotech events where um one of the     
2:08:13     
presenters was Frontier Bio talking about their vascularization biop printer     
2:08:19     
um you know so you know the commercial bioprinting space is really interesting     
2:08:25     
it's not you know we've looked at the kind of commercial meas     
2:08:30     
um the you know so we're we're trying to make an open MEA or mind in vitro is an open     
2:08:37     
MEA or open source MEA right built built on the open ef platform     
2:08:44     
we we attended um Maxwell Bios uh webinar this this week it's one of     
2:08:51     
the top manufacturers and you know it's super impressive     
2:08:58     
you know Berkeley currently has like 64 channel     
2:09:05     
system that was donated to them a a lowend Maxwell bios systems chip is     
2:09:14     
30,000 channels on a cos you know like it's incredibly detailed     
2:09:22     
uh and yeah anyway but the the     
2:09:29     
you know bioprinting has is like is like surgical robots right like like there's     
2:09:35     
companies with major backing finance that are producing     
2:09:42     
systems because you know there's a lot of other there's a lot of tissues you     
2:09:47     
know that aren't brain yeah and and people who aren't trying to do     
2:09:52     
electrofphys from that brain uh that that are better targets or better first     
2:09:59     
applications and you know and medtec money is is huge money right so     
2:10:08     
it's um yeah be be spending a little bit of time     
2:10:14     
before mid July to check out what's uh what's possible But     
2:10:20     
um it is an interesting time to um to get into this i mean in terms of a bunch     
2:10:27     
of technologies coming together so I think that's um     
2:10:38     
human brain mapping is going on this week okay so so a lot of social media     
2:10:44     
around that uh uh yeah so uh     
2:10:53     
he I know so Paul Thompson is one of the people     
2:10:59     
Paul Thompson kind of heads the Enigma project so this is what you know what     
2:11:05     
psychiat psychiatric neur imaging is these days which is you know combine     
2:11:12     
group everybody's individual lab data together into a giant data set     
2:11:20     
and so Paul did both like a keynote going covering enigma that is on YouTube     
2:11:29     
um he's great about post you know being super public about all his his uh events     
2:11:36     
and and things i I even voted he he he actually also posted a um how many     
2:11:43     
people can you identify like like he had like a 50 photos of you know him taking     
2:11:49     
selfies with people um that I actually posted on Narctic X just because you know Yeah i I wish I could be in     
2:11:56     
Australia that is just too far you know there's so much time um uh I'm     
2:12:04     
super happy though that John Griffith who's the other incoming Neurexboard     
2:12:10     
member is there and did he did the neural field theory workshop     
2:12:17     
uh there and yeah so um hoping to hear about that uh what     
2:12:26     
what Paul says and you know so he's a psychiatrist or you know he does this     
2:12:32     
but he's he's a real mathematician right and he said that the the thing that he     
2:12:39     
had a post um that I think I reshared on LinkedIn that     
2:12:45     
um that about the amount of generative AI that he's actually seeing at at human     
2:12:52     
brain mapping which to me it I mean you know is somewhat not surprising it it     
2:12:59     
als also speaks certain amount to you know like um stability wasn't crazy to     
2:13:07     
thinking about these things oh people are applying generative AI to neuro imaging okay yeah yeah yeah yeah and and     
2:13:16     
uh and so yeah just like like I'm I'm     
2:13:21     
looking forward to some kind of you know overviews of of what happened and you     
2:13:27     
know what were the big themes and takeaways from from this year's meeting     
2:13:34     
i think it's um um one one last thing just you know talking a lot spent a lot     
2:13:42     
of time talking about neur this week because of deep tech week and you know     
2:13:47     
there are a lot of really promising things um but I I think it's important     
2:13:54     
to to restate every every so often that um I think     
2:14:01     
none of these technologies are useful in our understanding or treatment of     
2:14:06     
schizophrenia and and you know so it's like people keep on asking me I mean one     
2:14:12     
I'm standing there with a colonel helmet right they're like so how long have you been an FN's research     
2:14:19     
like you you misunderstand why I'm holding this helmet     
2:14:24     
um uh you know focused ultrasounds is super     
2:14:31     
cool um the targets that we're choosing in focus ultrasounds are all coming from     
2:14:36     
deep brain stimulation uh and and kind of neurosurgical     
2:14:43     
understanding of of the brain uh     
2:14:50     
every time you know like like every one of these neurot talks somebody will always end     
2:14:56     
with like and this will be really important for understanding schizophrenia     
2:15:02     
understanding and treatment of schizophrenia like you you had me you know like like     
2:15:08     
why ruin that tech you know and and you     
2:15:14     
know and it's just like why am I not interested in focus ultrasound because you know these are developmental     
2:15:21     
disorders right so what we're interested in is actually how the brain develops     
2:15:28     
and the different trajectories that that can take and you know that the different ways that uh teaching self-organizes all     
2:15:35     
right so this is you know just uh to to reiterate you know uh why I very happy     
2:15:43     
to be in developmental neurobiology and uh you know and that organoids are are     
2:15:51     
the goal because of that kind of     
2:15:57     
the those those opportunities to to understand that mechanistically and and     
2:16:02     
you know 3D bio printing and and especially Zeb Gardner's Ford meat you     
2:16:08     
know where it's just like thinking about that you know I place them in this     
2:16:15     
configuration but with with time they do     
2:16:20     
something else and so it's just like like whether it's Dev Gartner or whether it's Anthrobots you know that like that     
2:16:29     
speaks to Yeah um our our understanding of of     
2:16:36     
cells as agential matter you know right     
2:16:41     
anyway that that seems like a good good uh end point     
2:16:49     
[Music] yeah we had a couple of comments in the     
2:16:54     
chat um some claps and thumbs ups from Jesse um and then uh BD will talk more     
2:17:02     
about the mentorship program she spoke about it yesterday's meeting and     
2:17:07     
you know we could do that in the Slack but yeah I'm very interested to hear     
2:17:13     
about that and to continue on with our discussions that Jesse brought to the     
2:17:18     
table and and Morgan brought to the table so yeah great stuff going on real     
2:17:24     
real quick based off of what Morgan just said I will share something soon uh     
2:17:29     
there was a very interesting discussion well I haven't I didn't get control of it but it was basically Michael Le Adam     
2:17:34     
Sack from Max Shen okay yeah and Ele just posted it um on his channel thing     
2:17:41     
but in the start of it there's like a a three or four minute clip where Elean     
2:17:47     
does an overview of like what he's doing and how Max Shen is sort of doing is learning at pain i would have attended     
2:17:53     
an event today but I'm not able to go to it um he studies like pain processing     
2:17:58     
and signal processing and like chronic um you know illness and things like that     
2:18:04     
but he had this introduction to his story and then Lemon comes like okay well this relates to my stuff in this     
2:18:09     
way and Lemon's explanation just like three three three great minutes of juaposing things kind of related to what     
2:18:16     
you said about like cells and patterns and things of the body and activation not just the neurons but like from cells     
2:18:22     
patterns through different mediums of the body it was just it was it was a nice thing which I'm going to say more about it soon and then we can maybe talk     
2:18:29     
about next week or maybe Monday but but otherwise next time we I'll be mentioning that um that clip for sure so     
2:18:37     
good stuff there and good stuff this week um that's that's that's a great point i I wanted to catch that talk and     
2:18:45     
and you know I don't know if Vinnie is still here but we definitely do want to hear about your     
2:18:52     
stuff okay actually like I'll just share actually like two minutes okay     
2:19:00     
you see my screen yeah yes so like uh I'll just brief you all up with what we     
2:19:06     
have so this is the name of the committee and it's basically focused on     
2:19:12     
open source so we have some domain workshops like for the first year     
2:19:17     
students i just completed my second year so now I'm going to be going to the third year so we are the like at the top     
2:19:24     
most position in this committee so the thing is that second year students uh     
2:19:29     
will like but the trend is that second year students usually conduct some workshops for the first year students     
2:19:35     
and they can be on any domain like computer vision LLP or anything so this year we had conducted a basic workshop     
2:19:42     
on Python and Git GitHub and the second one was on computer vision so that's     
2:19:48     
what we have and then after that we have this mentorship program where a few     
2:19:53     
students from the second year like first school students going from the first year to second year are mentored by the     
2:19:59     
seniors on any project like uh my super pros which I had mentioned about where     
2:20:05     
actually learned reinforcement learning was a part of this program where I had     
2:20:10     
another with me and we were working on the whole project and learning     
2:20:15     
reinforcement learning and applying all the different algorithms and uh there     
2:20:20     
were like many more people who were working on different projects so what used to happen is once in every two     
2:20:26     
weeks we used to have these meets that we used to update everyone about what we have done in the project so we can uh     
2:20:32     
like we can just have that much confidence and we are just motivated throughout to continue that project and     
2:20:38     
not leave it uh like not leave it undone or something so that's what we have and     
2:20:44     
then yeah we like our seniors encourage us to have many open source contributions or participate in have to     
2:20:51     
work or something like that so that uh yeah like just think yeah I don't know     
2:20:57     
like this committee is about open source then like our seniors a lot of them who     
2:21:03     
got into G-Soft last year and before that they were the ones who guided us so     
2:21:08     
again this year there are like around seven of us who are doing GOC all of us are in different organizations i'm with     
2:21:14     
you all and a lot of my friends are there too so our seniors with the ones who were guiding us and they gave us the     
2:21:22     
awareness and yeah apart from that we just we just have some competitions     
2:21:27     
which are again based on open source contributions or something like that and yeah it's a picture of our team i think     
2:21:34     
this is a better picture all of us are there in this picture then so this a picture from the workshop     
2:21:42     
where um there are some people yeah there some people who are teaching I was teaching something as well i don't know     
2:21:48     
whether my picture has been captured but yeah this is our lab like the labs in our university and we provide everyone     
2:21:58     
the computers but if they want they can bring their own laptops as well so we were just teaching something and these     
2:22:04     
are just like a few pictures from that then apart from that uh this is the main     
2:22:10     
website that we have right now so these are the projects for these are the     
2:22:16     
projects that you're going to have this year maybe I can share this link with you all can it     
2:22:24     
Yeah so this is what we have this is this year's project list i'm going to be     
2:22:30     
mentoring this project and we also have these tasks that we know how many people are actually interested in tasks so we     
2:22:38     
have three tasks so this is what this is what I did last year obviously the tasks and the projects were different but now     
2:22:45     
uh since like since it's time for us to be seniors and guide our juniors this is     
2:22:51     
what we are doing so I'm a mentor i can show you my mentor dashboard so like this I actually have an access     
2:22:58     
to uh seeing how many people have submitted the tasks and approving their tasks or something but yeah it's just     
2:23:05     
like a minor level of work like it's not very serious but we just encourage them     
2:23:10     
to we just encourage them to uh do projects or something like that so we     
2:23:16

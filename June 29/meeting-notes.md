## Notes
Gave updates: open-source model. General model forming. Meeting with Shubham.

Cybernetics retrace — JoPro working groups. 

Von Neumann architecture:

Focus #1: memory and early cybernetics.

Focus #2: philosophy of computation. 

Focus #3: data science and society, ethics, and tech.


Data as a by-product  of computational media.

new space: decision-making, strategy. Data ethics.

selection of a model (different computational regimes).


Memory and Computer Architectures

idea systems, what does cybernetics bring to the table?

JoPro — Jen is doing a lot of things. “Inside Out”, certain theories of emotions. What are core emotions, how are these accessible? From “Inside Out” to theory.

core memory — emotional label. Act of transmitting a viewpoint, creation of alternatives.

how to identify, represent, and produce emotional states. Variation — quantification.


Generative variety — storage — variety.

shared language — between kids/adults.

emotion work — blogpost, presentation.

variation in mental health across cultures. Reactions. Emotional control space.

Psychological lopsidedness. Cultural takes on social norms.

System 1 vs. System 2: model using meta-brains. 

Philosophy of Computation. #devAI Slack channel —> ARC stuff, ML Street Talk.

computational definition of creativity — know it when we see it.

Avery project — circumstance and context. World Model.

punching up and down — “Are Humans that Creative”.


Specific context, social rules needed to do good human — i.e. “punching up vs. punching down”.

D&D creativity — creativity and measuring intelligence. Amount-capacity vs. process-result.

what is our model for creativity. Creative does not equal divergence from the norm.

creativity is embedded in the context of the cannon.

Innovations, common experience.


Compulsion of substance (resonance). Strong communication between combinatorial and language as a tool of communication.

communication rather than thought (find ways to create meaning).

reinforcement of random behavior — expressivity.

context odor-color associations (local experiences).

* creativity as cultural evolution.

also, broader contexts of acceptibility to explore, 'play', and safely experience things

Transcript

hello morning morning all right um so I guess we can     
0:08     
get started so this week we had uh a lot of     
0:14     
stuff going on in the lab we had Diva worm on Monday which was very mathematically     
0:21     
heavy as I was informed um but it was basically some readings on I think there was one     
0:28     
reading on optimal train transport and another paper we went     
0:34     
over um and so this was like kind of you know optimal transport and other kinds     
0:40     
of biophysics but in the context of how to bring that to modeling modeling     
0:46     
development so that's uh dorm and then uh we had our cybernetics meeting we     
0:53     
returned to our cybernetics meetings so we had our cybernetics meeting which was     
0:59     
kind of an organizational meeting Clearing House of ideas we kind of worked out sort of where we've been in     
1:06     
that group and we you know we've hit a lot of topics so we needed a chance to     
1:13     
sort of figure out how those fit together and I don't think we got 100% of the way there but you know having     
1:20     
that outline is good valuable we can then go back and I don't know how we     
1:25     
want to work out some of those ideas you know hopefully we can work out some of those     
1:31     
ideas into artifacts papers and presentations and     
1:37     
whatever and then um I sort of previewed the paper that we have for the special     
1:45     
issue so that paper is now in the cybernetics channel I think and that's     
1:51     
available for people to read and go over um and I'm going to try to go over     
1:56     
it somewhat in the cybernetics meetings I think we'll have one two weeks and we'll go over the paper um you know I     
2:04     
don't know if we want to go over it like we usually go over papers or um you know how we want to do that     
2:10     
but that that would be good there's a lot in there um it's kind of like you     
2:15     
know synthesizing what we've been talking about in the meetings but also adding some uh computational toy model type     
2:25     
exercises and considering the role of um you know how the good regulator fits     
2:33     
into machine machine learning literature and the world models literature and as it turns out you know     
2:39     
there's a lot of interesting stuff going on with uh physics modeling or not     
2:44     
physics modeling and modeling physical phenomena but using things like     
2:50     
diffusion and entropy models and things like that so you know we kind of get     
2:55     
into a little bit of that a little bit of uh you know different types of     
3:01     
distributions and then talking about Auto distribution things it's kind of hard to in it put a a synct description     
3:08     
of it here but you know going through the paper it becomes pretty clear how those connections     
3:14     
work uh so that's that's uh cybernetics and then of course we had our open source meeting yesterday which     
3:20     
was very good Sara presented on her work um and you know she's making good     
3:27     
progress on the large language models and all that and then uh we also had     
3:34     
um uh some other updates and there's a lot of interesting work going on with     
3:39     
the uh open source sustainability stuff and we also had Jesse talked a little     
3:46     
bit about some of his uh writing exercises for the summer and and that     
3:51     
sort of thing and then we had some other updates as well so it was good stuff so     
3:57     
our meetings are you know we're having some good conversations there some good work being done there yeah um it's been     
4:05     
nice to kind of get back a little more in the swing of things I think I saw that um the video was posted as well     
4:12     
from the Cy etics reading group yeah cognition Futures instead of traing     
4:19     
room oh um not a big deal but     
4:25     
um uh it's been it's been interesting to see all the different things     
4:30     
um coming up and particularly for the cybernetics reading group     
4:36     
um I it's kind of an interesting     
4:42     
uh moment to to return to that um I do     
4:47     
really look forward to going through the paper I saw that you posted that in the cybernetics channel like the latest     
4:52     
update yeah uh which is good I don't I have no idea how much is different from the previous one that I was looking at     
4:57     
before um but I'll I'll be at that yeah over this week um I don't think we're     
5:04     
having I probably won't I'm hesitant to make a coition Futures meeting this week     
5:10     
because of the way it falls around the holiday stuff so I I don't think we're going to have any of those meetings this     
5:16     
week I think we will have a I think Diva worm and open source meetings will still happen though right um uh Diva worm yes     
5:23     
maybe open source uh probably open source I I think we need to have keep on     
5:29     
top of that on a weekly basis but this in in the US it's the fourth of July     
5:35     
holiday so uh Canada they have July 1st so actually Monday we might have a     
5:42     
smaller devoor meeting because we have uh Canadian     
5:47     
contingent uh won be there probably so it'll be a little bit different but     
5:52     
anyways um yeah     
6:01     
right so that's great uh did you uh so let's do updates um and I guess     
6:09     
Jesse uh yeah if anybody else wants to go first I might say more in few minutes     
6:15     
so I'll I'll pause myself for a little bit     
6:20     
okay yeah I can go yeah I mostly gave most of the     
6:25     
updates yesterday so yeah as BR said like I've been working on on the open source model and I'm like uh I would say     
6:35     
reaching like some sense of like a good framework model that should be completed     
6:44     
hopefully hello     
6:49     
more hi hi can I come out yes yes oh     
6:54     
okay cut off yeah it did cut off yeah oh okay     
7:00     
yeah I just so I'll just recap so as I was saying like as Bley said I gave most of the updates yesterday uh in the open     
7:06     
source meetings I've just been working on the uh model and I think I've reached like a good place where I've uh kind of     
7:14     
have a base framework model kind of forming that should hopefully be done by next week and then I can uh build up on     
7:23     
it like add more metrics and add sub and build up money and after the yesterday     
7:29     
meet I had a small meet with Sham as well we wanted to kind of uh since we're     
7:35     
both working on the same project we wanted to kind of uh exchange approach even that was nice and uh yeah that's     
7:45     
about okay thanks yeah thank you yeah it was a great uh great bit of work you     
7:51     
showed yesterday at our open source meeting so going through sort of     
7:56     
building um agents and doing these tasks that are basically open source     
8:02     
contributions and so that's great um you know I I I really interested to see how     
8:09     
that can work out and I I think chup is kind of doing a similar thing and well I     
8:14     
mean I guess that's kind of the core of the whole sustainability thing is to build like a model around something like     
8:23     
uh maybe like a pull request because it's the most comp you know it's the most uh sort of quantitative     
8:29     
thing you can do in that space I mean you can also do things like look at conversations and we talked about some     
8:36     
papers with respect to conversation so if you had like uh an open source     
8:42     
Community uh Forum you know or a discussion board where you had some     
8:47     
thing that you wanted to discuss and people were discussing things you know you could use like the large language     
8:53     
models for that as well and kind of get somewhere um on you know like things     
8:58     
that aren't like very specific issues but larger conversations that might be a little     
9:03     
harder to do in fact so I'm glad that you're doing the the open or the GitHub     
9:09     
issues it's a very tracable problem but uh but there yeah there are other ways     
9:15     
we can you know model open source activity and one of the problems with     
9:20     
measuring and we've talked about this in years past uh with measuring open- Source activity is that you know it's     
9:26     
hard to you know you can look at what people are doing on GitHub you can kind of look at how     
9:32     
people are discussing things in for uh you know your forums like our slack for     
9:38     
example but you know putting that all together and saying how much people are contributing to a project or how much     
9:44     
work is involved in a certain feature or project um over a certain period of time it's kind of hard to do to get those     
9:52     
statistics and or and or to model those processes it's hard to do but but you     
9:58     
know this is like a good I think a good traal step towards that     
10:06     
so yes definitely I do hope like once all of the GitHub part is sorted out like going to the conversations part     
10:13     
hopefully the next step in the one yeah yeah that's great thank     
10:21     
you I don't know if Morgan is available right now but you know he's not     
10:28     
be still Gathering myself just just a bit that's yeah     
10:34     
thanks yeah um um so I I might go a little bit     
10:43     
through I don't know um I might retrace a few things in the     
10:50     
cybernetics reading group um and talk about some other things but I don't know     
10:56     
if you're going to go I don't think you're going to go over more of that stuff later I don't think your plan is to revisit     
11:01     
that yourself uh not today no okay um yeah and I'm not I'm not I'm kind of     
11:08     
just sharing it just to mention it here not I'm not going to be adding um new things to it but I'll I'll just I think     
11:16     
you can I'm just going to share from from meeting yeah     
11:22     
um it's been interesting [Music]     
11:27     
to even just retrace a lot of these these these     
11:33     
Concepts um I think and especially things like     
11:41     
um I'm I'm doing also I'm mentioning this also because I'm I'm sort of thinking     
11:47     
about um in not not necessarily in in terms of     
11:53     
like joepro working group stuff uh but but like     
12:01     
I I continue to try to think of a coherent way to sort     
12:06     
of explain or demarcate some of the interests of either like the cybernetics     
12:13     
reading group or how it fits with these these     
12:18     
things [Music] in for we don't really use this phrase     
12:23     
anymore but it's still like the phrase that was imprinted upon me and so I think about it in the lab is like the     
12:30     
representational brains and phenotypes you know that that big old school Banner     
12:36     
of of ideas and things and this isn't you know necessarily that but but we     
12:43     
we've used things like IM reimagining cybernetics which is kind of I think     
12:48     
more more fit here and and even getting     
12:54     
more deeper into the weeds like we we've talked about um kind of thought about these different     
13:01     
fogy of research or research thrusts is a lot of in websites research that     
13:09     
institutions say um memory early biological cybernetics philosophy computation was     
13:16     
kind of hashed out last time as what to call it and there's like history CICS     
13:21     
regulatory theories as other things that that we're looking at here is not even a sense of we are trying to do like we're     
13:30     
not you know it's it's sort of even this at this work     
13:35     
of creating internal language to differentiate where we've been we have I     
13:43     
mean we've had Michael 11 readings we've had this is this is     
13:49     
um machana this is um and that's kind of     
13:54     
this whole there's a there's sort of this chain of machana and rea and then post Vera um stuff that we've we've been     
14:03     
through um which which has extended across the cybernetics reading group and     
14:09     
cognition Futures and things directly in well other parts of the lab I suppose um     
14:16     
this is the yogi paper I believe um it's sort     
14:22     
of yeah and then and then R the anticipatory systems so     
14:27     
it's I'm I'm particular I think I think there's something to be said about thinking     
14:35     
about memory computation and these regulatory theories like in my in my     
14:40     
mind there's there's stuff that's there's something that's at a very early stages of like like pre     
14:49     
crystallization um but but sort of     
14:56     
um I'm I'm excited to do that and especially I'm particularly excited     
15:01     
about sort of um like I I need I probably should look at this this reference for the wol     
15:09     
who was wolf talking to for that I forget uh     
15:15     
Hoffman yeah yeah um but     
15:21     
um the I think the idea of philosophy computation in general is interesting     
15:28     
because when I even when I was applying to I think I applied to like somewhere in the brains minds and machines thing     
15:35     
at MIT at one point I don't know if it was a summer school which I did I did go to one time or the one of their programs     
15:41     
or something um that was sort of the first time I saw talking about     
15:48     
computation in a certain way and that was some years ago um so     
15:57     
now I feel like I have so many more of my own ideas and intuitions and things     
16:02     
to sort out about I guess what might be philosophy of computation that I'm excited to go there uh     
16:10     
particularly in terms of um I think I may mentioned it during     
16:18     
this this past meeting but there's     
16:24     
um there was a really I need to find sort of the original reference point     
16:31     
but there was something in one of my earlier course courses for my degree program that was     
16:39     
talking about um basically data as a byproduct of     
16:45     
interacting with computational mediums and um it was worded slightly     
16:51     
differently than that but there's there's something between that     
17:00     
um philosophy computation in general and this new there's this new space I don't     
17:07     
really know what to call it yet and and things that come to my mind are sort of like decision making or     
17:16     
strategy um not quite leadership but like the nature of not just not just like I don't know     
17:26     
economics uh like like Daniel conman kind of stuff but much     
17:35     
more I don't know I really don't know the space for it but it's sort of keeping in mind philosophy commutation     
17:40     
keeping in mind this this sort of interesting     
17:46     
um you know data and computational mediums and the interaction with them     
17:52     
but then also the stuff from this this data ethics data ethics course that I was that I really enjoyed this this     
18:00     
recently um this this nature of     
18:06     
selection of either a model or selection     
18:11     
of a selection     
18:20     
of almost like computational regimes and saying okay this is this is     
18:28     
the the signing off on this is this is this is the model we're going to use for     
18:33     
whatever and the nature of doing that um by by whatever the authority is to do so     
18:41     
and and so it kind of it was an interesting space and I don't I don't know what what to do with it or to say     
18:47     
about it um I have to find much more I'm trying to find I'm trying to talk to people who've been like the instructor     
18:54     
about it to say like hey like what what should I call this as I'm looking into space because I don't I don't really     
19:00     
know yet everybody's kind of on break right now so it's it's hard to do that but     
19:06     
um I'm mentioning all this out of a sense of uh there's there's something there     
19:13     
that sort of takes from cybernetics takes from     
19:19     
some of the data science and machine learning stuff that we talked about but also dovetails a lot into the sort of     
19:26     
society ethics Tech stuff like I'm sure if I could just talk to a bunch of we     
19:32     
robot people a conference that we've been at a few times and ask them about this they give me really good ideas     
19:39     
they're mostly a lot of a bunch of lawyers you know in the derogatory town but there there are a lot of policy and     
19:45     
legal legal Scholars and Andy people actually I have I should ask someone     
19:51     
someone of the legal Scholars um that I met in Oxford about this that'd be a fun     
19:58     
topic talk about that but so great I I just saw I I felt you know some like     
20:04     
there's something that I have to resolve I to just talk about it and hopefully it will come up that was that was a bit of     
20:10     
that um but but but quite seriously     
20:16     
um I I think in and of itself for the     
20:21     
reading group um the cybernetics reading group reimagining cybernetics whatever we want     
20:28     
call this space um I'm happy that we're looking at the sort of memory components     
20:36     
and sort of the implicit relationship to what we talked about last time architectures I suppose um and and and     
20:44     
you know the kind of variation or not therein and so on and so forth     
20:50     
um philosophy of computation and then yes um like these     
20:56     
broader take on regulatory theories ideas systems I think those are     
21:02     
that's going to be a very I'm look I'm looking forward to getting back into that space and I'm curious personally how it     
21:09     
relates to this other data decision making strategy space     
21:17     
or um I don't know what to call it yet if anybody has any ideas about what to call I'm looking for let me know but     
21:25     
um that's that's sort of a a a first pass on that     
21:33     
um Beyond this um I'm just trying to to do a lot     
21:39     
of writing and trying to let myself go into a period of writing and it's     
21:45     
actually quite challenging to do um the way that I want to do it so um I I will     
21:52     
be cautious like there's something that I could talk I could talk more about the thing that I wrote today but I'm not I'm     
21:58     
not going to I haven't do it yet today I might talk about it but I'm not prepared     
22:03     
to like show it off and go deeply into it because I haven't had the time     
22:08     
to you know it's still a draft it's not a published post um but um I am you know     
22:17     
I'm really excited to to do that and to do the     
22:23     
requisite work I I feel like there's both the this to to speak     
22:29     
just about the writing process itself here     
22:35     
um it's both really rewarding but also I said to one of my friends this morning     
22:41     
like it has it's a little bit of the feeling like you're you're in It's let's     
22:46     
say undergraduate school and it's not like finals pressure but it's sort of     
22:52     
like the midterm feeling of oh man I have all these like term papers these like midterm papers that is like I'm in     
22:59     
I'm in like five or six courses and they all have papers to and and it's sort of     
23:04     
that unpleasant motivation but but it's there and it's just this sense     
23:11     
of uh you know doing it is really weird especially when you're trying to     
23:16     
do um the kind of writing that I'm interested in doing which is which is     
23:22     
not I don't know I don't have a lot of great examples that     
23:28     
that fit maybe maybe I'm just very ignorant about it um I don't think I'm that special or anything in what I'm     
23:34     
trying to say or do more like I'm just not versed in the the the art of the     
23:39     
this kind of writing um so it's it's it's challenging in that way um but um I'm I I'm very     
23:49     
happy to start both like publishing some of the     
23:56     
things and then thinking about um like some of the Vantage Point stuff     
24:04     
I wouldn't like I was looking a little bit of journals just basically turn it into a paper to do and I think that could be something I think there's     
24:11     
enough there um so I'm happy to talk about that a little bit um at some point     
24:18     
and then um yeah uh I think I think that's that's     
24:26     
that's all I need to say about that um no no cognition features next week because it's going to     
24:32     
be I don't want to have to like say we're going to do it then cancel it and then be weird so I'm just going to do a pause and next time uh will be a much     
24:42     
more clear clear a clear Wednesday night as it were so um a lot of Joe Pro stuff     
24:50     
is going on Jen Jen isn't at these meetings but Jen is doing a lot of um     
24:56     
really a lot of things uh one thing I can kind of say about that I suppose is     
25:02     
um I don't know if anybody's seen the Inside Out movies or inside out water inside out too but uh what's interesting     
25:10     
is that they're sort of based off of certain theories of emotions and certain theories of     
25:16     
um like internal family systems is one of the major things but also uh Paul     
25:22     
emman of ekman's emotions um was a consultant I think at least on the     
25:29     
second one if not the first one and it was interesting to see some of the reviews about it and and the discussion     
25:34     
about it in the sense of um I think one person was like what I     
25:40     
want to have 87 emotions in this film can we do that and then Disney's like Pi pick like no you gotta pick pick five     
25:47     
let's go from there you know this sort of this sort of uh it'd be interesting to find more commentary on how the     
25:55     
people in that space um chose which emotions to do and why and how     
26:02     
like that's something that I think Jen's looking into a bit and looking at how um     
26:08     
sort of how's how's the theory being played out in in in accessible terms in these movies as part of sort of the     
26:15     
mental health working group like like what what the the broader umbrella of     
26:20     
the DSM project and all that stuff so that's I respect what she's doing there     
26:26     
and we're having a lot of conversations about that and and um the sort of accessible models of these things um so     
26:35     
good good good for her for that and um I'm looking forward to     
26:41     
having a little more of a outside everything I'm saying     
26:47     
like I have a lot of drive and pressure um to update like the jopro website I'm     
26:53     
working on that very much to just have like what you know take     
26:59     
I I can I can like show notion pages with writing that is sort of generically     
27:05     
intelligible to people right now but I know having some very     
27:10     
simple like Cate like visualization of what's Happening across different groups     
27:18     
will matter uh so I'm I'm working on that too which is sort of this dual     
27:23     
challenge of writing material writing conceptual like like big vision papers or writing even just     
27:31     
generic statements about what blurbs about what's happening making the website and writing these actual     
27:38     
artifacts um that's all the stuff that's going on so I feel like I'm always saying oh yeah stuff's going but but     
27:44     
that's just that's just the way it is but um it there's a lot of fun things     
27:49     
happening in that space I'm looking forward to sharing it more openly ahead but I'll leave it those are my broad     
27:56     
updates for now well that's great yeah and I'm not always in the loop on the um     
28:03     
sort of the mental health stuff so I'm glad that you're able to translate that     
28:08     
for us here uh yeah it sounds interesting with emotion in terms of emotions and which     
28:14     
ones are most accessible and you know there's this aspect of like Effective computing and     
28:20     
effective modeling where we're trying to model emotional states either recognizing them or producing them in     
28:27     
some way we we can I don't know if people want to do that right now but like some of the     
28:33     
things that are coming up in those discussions um I actually thinking this morning about one thing like the idea of     
28:38     
having a core memory which is Central to both films is actually a great like I     
28:44     
think about it as as I think everybody here knows but just a reader like I what     
28:52     
through across all of these um different Arenas that we talk about in the lab uh     
28:58     
I'm always one of my favorite lenses or or favorite and also some the lens some     
29:06     
the lens I wish I could put down but I I can't is the lens of like pedagogy and teaching and instruction and the act of     
29:15     
transmitting or like communicating a Viewpoint the Vantage Point stuff that I'm talking about also just like how do     
29:20     
you do it or like how how is it how is the creation of alter alternatives for     
29:29     
someone who does not yet have Alternatives or Nuance happen and so in the case of     
29:35     
inside out and um Court memories it gives us great     
29:42     
visualization like it's a great I have to give them credit like it's this wonderful visualization of the council     
29:47     
and this big bass Machinery that's never fully explained which is uh you know it     
29:53     
is and it isn't which is very well done so it's like it's like I I really applaud the movie for or this sort     
29:59     
of you know all models are wrong some are useful what's what's what's the     
30:05     
right way to model how how emotions are working at a very accessible way both     
30:10     
for children who can crowly grasp it but also I think the adults watching the     
30:15     
film with the kids who can now have this sort of shared language and reference point so the idea of this core memory um     
30:22     
if anyone was familiar with like The Telltale Games or or modern games especially that had like they like oh     
30:29     
like uh Jesse will remember this like it's sort of this something happens and     
30:34     
then it's it's crystallized into a an orb and then the orb tends to     
30:41     
be uh colored with one of the emotions and at least earlier on in the series     
30:47     
like it's it's a happy emotion it's a joy emotion it's a fear emotion it's a disgust and I just feel like this sense     
30:55     
of creating like this to me is sort of this it's like okay um this is this is     
31:02     
sort of the level of weight like everybody's T okay what's an electron and how does it relate to     
31:10     
the proton or the neutron like where is it you know what's outside of this thing     
31:16     
in the middle and so to have this um very simple model of a core memory and     
31:23     
then putting an emotional label on it like that's like that's interesting at a very fundamental     
31:28     
Al teaching standpoint you know um or or just like trying to create a basic     
31:35     
differentiation and I don't I don't I don't think it's you know great but also like it's the way of doing that um it's     
31:43     
interesting and and and it has implications yes for like computation or just H like creating creating     
31:52     
tenable uh uh     
31:58     
I don't want to say quantification but at least the variation like making accessible variation to things that are     
32:04     
pretty obscure or difficult to do so I mean that's that's the whole angle of     
32:09     
interest for for the space and um what I what I will say on on a one level is um     
32:18     
unfortunately I would I would not recommend seeing Inside Out 2 in     
32:23     
theaters um and not because kids or anything but because if you're trying to pay attention so it's sort of like the     
32:31     
idea of it just doesn't work like like like it's sort of like     
32:38     
think of like action adventure movie or like intense personal drama like there's this okay I'm in the theater this sounds     
32:45     
great intense things are happening and then I just don't equate that     
32:51     
with a Serene space at which I really want to understand my emotional um     
32:59     
my emotional like what like what's going on like it was too like if you're if     
33:04     
you're trying to actually process this stuff in a deeper way it's very it's very jarring um the stepping away and     
33:11     
thinking about the content it's great um but this the second version was very     
33:19     
yeah like I Sor I mention you know kids and it was honestly was it even the kids     
33:25     
though like like like I I was kind of anticipating that and there was kids and there was there was some like you know     
33:32     
just kept getting up in in front of me all the time but that wasn't the problem for me the problem for me was this is a     
33:38     
much better movie to just get at at home or watch on a     
33:43     
streaming thing and just be able to pause it and process it because it was just so much stuff like if you're     
33:49     
empathically engaging or you're trying to be like there it it just the way it worked out was like it was like a ride     
33:57     
you wanted to off and you couldn't because because the tension in the film wasn't it it wasn't really it     
34:04     
didn't really feel external it was like okay anxiety is taking over     
34:11     
and and it just it wasn't really a rewarding film experience um but I think even that like     
34:17     
that's an interesting commentary too um on it um but but I think it's I think     
34:23     
inside out two because inside out two deals with puberty at a lence and and     
34:29     
basically going to high school and there's much more nuance and talk about suppressed emotions I this is all sort     
34:35     
of cool cool psychology um emotional stuff and and I really I really be curious to see like     
34:42     
Lisa Phil and barretts take on I haven't seen anything like that yet um but like i' I've genen found a few things like     
34:49     
like Paul Eckman then uh the the guy behind internal family systems and other things you know sort of this it it's to     
34:58     
to take to it was it was unpleasant in the theater um I'm I'm happy to do it I     
35:04     
guess because it's fun to talk about now but it was it was unpleasant but not necess say not to go but just sort of     
35:11     
like when when of my friend saw it before me and said oh I'd have to watch it three times a little bit too much too     
35:17     
fast and I'm like oh well you know are you just kind of being deie down about it or whatever uh and I know they're     
35:24     
kind of like pessimistic about some things and I go there and like oh yeah like it just doesn't it's just a tough     
35:31     
thing in the medium and it's it's because you want it to be all exciting in     
35:36     
reality um yeah in reality it's like if you're     
35:43     
if you're in there trying to like you know uh sort it out it can be it can be     
35:50     
a lot if you're in there for just the entertainment of it you know definitely go so I don't     
35:58     
know that's a long winding discussion about that but um I I think I think it's a fun it's a really interesting example     
36:05     
of trying to make a it's one of the only things I can think of in in popular     
36:10     
culture that has any sort of opportunity for shared language     
36:17     
between children and adults in very accessible ways about about the topic so I appla him for that very much that's     
36:24     
great yeah so I mean are you planning putting out a blog post on this or     
36:30     
presentation or I I have sort of encouraged Jen     
36:38     
to um there's sort of a series of small posts that we've discussed some about     
36:46     
just broad context what is the inside out some about the theory behind it yeah     
36:52     
um and then jens's also jens's uh really     
36:57     
like I think what she might want to do longer term is uh the Jen's very     
37:03     
interested in sort of mental health uh but also variation in mental     
37:11     
health across culture or other Nuance one of the things one of the main     
37:16     
research thrusts or like I don't know themes or pillars or whatever in the mental health gling group is how a lot     
37:22     
of mental health is very monolithic in its advice or in it perception of what a     
37:28     
person is or their experiences so she she really is interested in like an one     
37:35     
thing that that I know she's interested in and I'm encouraging her to do is     
37:40     
um I think it' be I'm try I think it' be good to you know I'm kind of in a stage     
37:45     
of let's let's write about many um you know like get used to writing about this first and then like culminate in writing     
37:52     
a piece on uh you know what what what would um     
37:59     
what's not quite like what would me what would inside out to be     
38:05     
for um this specific Community but sort of bringing cultural nuance and cultural     
38:13     
humility and cultural like awareness into it and just like like from this perspective what you know how how would     
38:20     
this relate or or she she's looked into how has this like subgroup um like in     
38:26     
their in their more like the community of that subg group looked at what was the reaction inside out um and kind of     
38:33     
going at a at that level of um you know     
38:39     
uh so on another interesting thing that she kind of found out about um     
38:44     
uh or or     
38:51     
it some of it's at a cultural level but also the sense of we've had really nice discussions about in the movie um Joy is     
39:00     
Ry the main character sort of like main emotion and I don't know if it I'm     
39:05     
really curious if this is a theoretical Choice are just sort of A Accessible way of of like communicating it but in the     
39:14     
the mother and the father's main emotions or like the ones at the center of their Council when they're talking     
39:20     
and sharing those clips of their counsels or internal emotional control space or whatever is different the mom     
39:27     
is like sadness and the fathers is anger and and so we it's there's things     
39:34     
to be said about variations in those things or like how the setup is um and     
39:39     
I'm I'm I will I'll throw all the way back to many many things from Avery in the past and and hash psychological     
39:47     
lopsidedness as a term of uh the the the the nonuniformity of information     
39:55     
processing or perhaps emotional processing everything too but suffice to say aen we've had conversations about     
40:03     
aen is looking into both individual variation and setup and how that kind of     
40:08     
translates into the film or or you know the film is sort of a representative of     
40:13     
that other things and then also cultural or other backgrounds like like like the     
40:19     
the way there's very different there's very different cultural takes on on social     
40:25     
norms on social anxiety on on you know all those things so um yes the     
40:31     
short answer is yes uh I'm encouraging and I believe Jen is working on some of     
40:37     
these things already uh like these sort of this sort of a series of I don't know blog posts or just writing practice on     
40:46     
Inside Out related Theory and Concepts um around these topics that sounds like     
40:51     
a pretty good uh vein of research Rich vein of research I guess     
40:58     
um yeah yeah and I think I think it it fits well with certain things that Jen wants to do later in life so I'm kind of     
41:05     
excited to to to give this space to that um it'll be it'll be exciting to see     
41:11     
what goes on there yeah yeah that's great all right so yeah what don't we     
41:17     
move on to uh some things so I want to and I see Lucas is here hello     
41:24     
Lucas but but give a couple of announcements here and share some things     
41:30     
Hi how are you guys doing hello hi uh yeah so first thing is is that uh     
41:40     
Sara uh pushed her a blog post on her Pro her latest project uh overview and     
41:48     
progress report to the medium so this is the Oro medium and of course she's     
41:55     
published a couple previous uh reports on her project so uh this is the the     
42:02     
latest one on building blocks the bottomup approach so this is her     
42:07     
discussion of what you know what kinds of things she's doing with auto code Rover swe agent and code     
42:16     
R and going over auto code Rover in particular and setting up this Paradigm     
42:23     
where she's setting up a large language model to do some sort of get Hub task     
42:28     
and then you know complete it through you know from sort of I guess conception     
42:34     
to review by a maintainer and so having those um you     
42:40     
know trying to model that in a large language model so having those steps walking through very specific things and     
42:48     
then having it in the sort of the parament of a GitHub PLL request so     
42:53     
that's good stuff and then this this actually this post talks more about you know experiences with auto code     
43:00     
Rover and implementing that which is you know this is I think very useful for     
43:05     
working through some of these tools uh especially when you're working on all these different types of large language     
43:11     
models and using these tools to um you know work on on these problems so     
43:19     
implementation you know is pretty difficult and that's really the challenge getting everything you Le so     
43:26     
congratulations to um SAR for that and I encourage people you know if     
43:32     
you want to contribute to the orl medium please you know set up a medium account     
43:39     
you can write a blog post so you know if you have any ideas I know Jesse's working on some things and um you know     
43:47     
I'll probably be posting some things soon but this is some this is a tool that you can use to produce these     
43:54     
research artifacts to get ideas out there the next thing I'd like to congratulate Lucas he's working on uh     
44:01     
the he's doing an openworm student ship so congraduations to Lucas um we've been     
44:07     
working on this for a while trying to set up a student ship where it will work for the next two months on a data     
44:14     
science problem um and you know kind of work through some of the details of that so     
44:20     
he's interested in working on you know the molecular biology and genetics of C     
44:28     
where you know we have a lot of these secondary databases we have the     
44:34     
ncbi we have a protein database we have embl and these are all     
44:40     
tools online that you can you know where Labs that produce data they put they     
44:47     
host their data sets and so these are repositories or you can go and you can find data sets on a wide range of uh you     
44:56     
know different different experiments that have been done in different species different model organisms uh assaying all sorts of genes     
45:04     
and proteins so you have a lot of high throughput uh data there you can     
45:10     
download and use in you you put together different data sets and you can answer     
45:15     
all sorts of questions so Lucas is going to be working through sort of a pipeline     
45:21     
for that uh we're going to be working on doing some embryo modeling taking the data answering some questions putting it     
45:29     
in the context of an embryo model and so forth so he you know we'll we'll see     
45:35     
what that looks like at the end of the process he's already done some work on a paper that we've been working on in Diva     
45:42     
worm and so he's going to use what has been done for that and and kind of translate that into a more sort of     
45:49     
reproducible Pipeline and you know that'll be something that people can use so you     
45:56     
know all organizations when they do these types of things they should have some sort of pipeline worked out maybe     
46:03     
some sort of standards for data analysis for you know data retrieval and so forth     
46:09     
so that's kind of going to be part of this the other part is you know     
46:15     
basically saying what do we need to know what kinds of things can we get from these databases and how are they relevant to     
46:23     
specific questions in development and in um cigan biology more     
46:29     
General so that's one thing that you know in openworm that is a Paramount     
46:35     
concern in fact that's why the student ship was created was to work with these secondary data sets so Labs will create     
46:44     
the second well they'll create data sets and they'll publish their data sets and the reason to do that is because you     
46:51     
know there's a lot of money that goes into creating a data set and those data you know those data     
46:58     
can sit on someone's hard drive and be used maybe about 5% of their     
47:03     
potential uh you know you you have Labs that publish papers but they don't get to put all their data in the papers they     
47:10     
certainly aren't sort of answering every possible question that be answered so you know you know producing     
47:18     
a data set allows other groups to use the data to validate their own experiments to ask questions that you     
47:26     
can't ask necessarily uh in any one research group because people have very different     
47:31     
perspectives on things so you know and then we can also put data sets together     
47:37     
and answer questions like you know looking at cross species comparisons or     
47:42     
looking at different uh like you know genes and proteins and how those things     
47:48     
are you know worked together in you know during biological regulation or during     
47:54     
some process so that's a very long-winded way of like describing what we want to do uh     
48:01     
Lucas has a very specific set of goals that he wants to accomplish he wants to work on a interactive notebook to sort     
48:10     
of build that pipe or to show how that pipeline can be built and how to do that     
48:15     
for people who want to do work later or you know be able to use it in further     
48:21     
research so he asked me some questions about like embryo modeling and this morning I said some references to the     
48:30     
work that's been done in Diva worm so I actually have uh on the DOR website I     
48:36     
have a number of videos that kind of walk through some of the uh developmental modeling and I sent     
48:44     
him those videos so you know if you go to the D.A worm website there's a a     
48:49     
media link and those media uh that's that's a lot of videos     
48:54     
that we have that we have a number videos that highlight some of the developmental modeling work that we've     
49:01     
done and so um the other thing is that he was asking me about Json files and     
49:07     
Json formats so I had a couple of uh things to talk about in terms of Json     
49:13     
but more generally in terms of how we think about data and how we think about representing data especially in the     
49:20     
secondary data set world where we're you know working on these kind of problems trying to take data sets that been     
49:26     
collected in experimental settings and then using them for purposes of modeling     
49:32     
organisms or modeling organs or modeling processes so this could be very wide     
49:37     
ranging from you know model organisms modeling the phenotypes to something     
49:43     
like organoids where you have um you might want to model different aspects of     
49:50     
organoids so the first thing I'm going to talk about here is this this is from     
49:55     
the openworm documentation this is data collection and representation so this talks a little     
50:01     
bit about how in open worm this is this doesn't include Diva Worm by the way     
50:07     
this is just an openworm how they've approached data uh you know data     
50:12     
collection and representations what that means is that data is collected you know using some sort of machine or device it     
50:20     
could be like uh uh movement tracking worms it could be uh you know different     
50:28     
uh molecular assays it could be uh different types of cell uh positional     
50:35     
information or cell Nom and clature information so this talks about how     
50:41     
there's not one single data source for a simulation so you know in openworm we     
50:47     
have a number of different simulations that are part of the simulation of of     
50:52     
the seans you have biophysics models you have uh neural     
50:58     
simulations you have movement simulations and so forth so there are many different types of data that go     
51:04     
into this and so in that being the case you have a lot of different you know you     
51:10     
basically have a set of numbers that get represented you get some sort of uh     
51:16     
metadata so they could be labels they could be annotations or whatever and     
51:22     
then putting those together in terms of translating from one type of represent ation to another in other words you know     
51:28     
if you have a biophysics model you have information about the physics you have     
51:34     
annotation and then you have some other information maybe in a neural model about what neurons are doing maybe their     
51:42     
biophysics there but the biophysics of St movement are very different from the biophysics of the connectum so those all     
51:49     
have to be translated over and so one way to do that is to take these multiple data sets put them     
51:56     
together and use some sort of representational scheme to sort of you     
52:01     
know uh give all the information to someone so if someone wanted to say     
52:06     
build a simulation of the worm they would have you know maybe biophysics     
52:12     
data from the connect down biophysics data for movement maybe some movement tracking data and putting all that     
52:18     
together in a framework where you can just identify a number it corresponds to this other number at a certain time     
52:24     
point and then you have some some annotation telling you what maybe what salad is or what you know State the worm     
52:34     
is in or other types of things maybe what kinds of genes we're talking about     
52:39     
or proteins what those proteins are associated with with those genes you know what proteins as genes are     
52:45     
associated with and so forth so there's a lot it's very there's a lot of complexity and so having the right sort     
52:53     
of um representational scheme to put all that together is important so we have different file     
53:00     
formats and interfaces to the model different data sets there's no master representation of all the data     
53:06     
incorporated into the model instead our aim is to keep the model open to be able to cope with different data     
53:13     
structures so you know we have to be flexible because if we want to simulate this we have to say you know if if we     
53:20     
want to represent a connectome it's usually some sort of U Matrix you know     
53:26     
like a connectivity Matrix and if it's you know some movement model of movement it might be a     
53:33     
Time series that has you know maybe uh different components that we want to     
53:39     
extract so we might have a raw time series with the numbers that go over     
53:44     
time we might have a decomposition of that time series and we want to use both of those but also map it to some of the     
53:51     
biophysical models and of course molecular models are even different yet     
53:57     
still we have you know counts we have sequence data and all sorts of     
54:02     
things so they say consider the conomics data there are different useful ways to     
54:09     
mine this data set for example a network X representation so there's this tool called Network X and this is often used     
54:17     
in the connectone this is a network model where this is used to model the connecto as a complex graph and this     
54:24     
enables questions to be asked about first and second nearest neighbors of a given neuron so when you have a in a     
54:31     
connecto you usually have different cells that serve as sort of you know uh     
54:36     
something that's connected to other cells and then those cells have neighbors so if you want to say     
54:44     
understand how some signal propagates across the connectum and produces a     
54:49     
behavior you might be interested in saying okay there's a focal cell and then there's a cell that it's connected     
54:55     
to and then that cell is connected to another cell and the signal propagates throughout the connectone and produces a     
55:03     
behavior but to do that you have to have a representation of those relationships uh so that's that's using     
55:10     
network X and then in contrast there is something called an rdf semantic graph     
55:15     
representation so this is using rdf which is a data format um and it's     
55:21     
basically colum so it has like multiple columns it's usually you know four or     
55:27     
five dimensional and this is a semantic graph representation so it's not just those connections but also there's a     
55:33     
semantic component and this is useful for reading and writing annotations     
55:39     
about multiple aspects of a neuron so in an rdf model we can take that Network we     
55:45     
can annotate it so we can say like for example if there's a certain neuron that we're interested in or a certain     
55:52     
relationship between two neurons we can actually add in you know uh are there     
55:58     
any papers that are key to understanding that relationship are there any properties     
56:03     
that describe that relationship in more detail other than just being a connection right so if you have two     
56:11     
neurons that are connected you want to know as much about it as you can but you want to have like some uh ground truth     
56:18     
you don't want to just say it's a correlation you want to say oh that's that's significant say in the movement circuit or that's significant in you     
56:26     
know they're they're both being regulated by the same protein they're both being they're part of a larger     
56:32     
process biological process those sorts of things uh so this is important here     
56:39     
um so we have the rdf model we have Network X representations and then the     
56:44     
neuroml representation which is of course modeling uh neurons this neuroml     
56:51     
is a neuro uh neuromodeling language or neuromod modeling language and this is     
56:57     
often used in in models of the connectome to sort of model morphology and simulation parameters so neuroml is     
57:05     
a language it's a markup language uh where you know they're able to put these sorts of information in a file and use     
57:13     
it in a simulation pass it into the simulation and then the simulation unpacks that format and it has all the     
57:21     
information available to it so and we'll talk about what J files are in a minute     
57:28     
but keep this in mind that like a lot of these different formats basically take     
57:34     
all the information you need to run a simulation or to run an analysis and it     
57:39     
puts it into a format that's readable to a machine I mean you can have something it's human readable but that isn't     
57:45     
really useful to like a Sim running a simulation because your computer needs     
57:51     
to be able to parse those those streams of information and put them into like a     
57:56     
framework that it can use to model something efficiently and we want to model something that you know we don't     
58:02     
want to spend like six years modeling the world I mean we can do this     
58:08     
depending on how you know the size of your you know the power of your computer     
58:13     
or the power of the computational nodes you're using we can do this in a reasonable amount of time and we you     
58:19     
know we have our blender uh our blender container that you can download and that     
58:25     
runs pretty decently but you still have a lot of problems with memory and uh you know     
58:32     
getting those those getting the simulations Run effective or efficiently     
58:37     
so that's why we want to use all these different file formats so and then     
58:42     
lastly a blender representation which just mentioned is a full 3D shape definition that can be used for     
58:49     
calculations and 3D space so we we want to use all of these uh different     
58:54     
representations and using them separately leads to an act ad hoc scripting FR representation so this is a     
59:02     
challenge for data integration so know if we use all these different representations separately if we use say     
59:08     
like a network X model and then an rdf model and a neuroml model to model the     
59:14     
connecto and they're just different aspects of the connecto you know we have these sort of ad hoc scripts being fed     
59:21     
into the simulation and as a result you know it can't do very efficient job of     
59:27     
representing things or running the simulation because you have you know you have the semantic information coming in     
59:33     
you have the basic connection information coming in and so forth and so it just kind of can't run efficiently     
59:41     
at every time step um but you know if we can figure out ways to integrate the     
59:46     
data better then we can actually you know uh run these simulations faster     
59:51     
more efficiently so uh one of the projects in openworm is ow meta which is this     
59:59     
project to create unified data access layer so it's taking all these different     
1:00:04     
file formats which are are useful on their own and they're efficient on their own and feeding them into a unified data     
1:00:11     
access layer that then will feed things into the simulation efficiently and it'll allow the simulation to run     
1:00:19     
faster um this allows the user to work with objects related to the biological reality of the worm so we can represent     
1:00:26     
not only the sort of the basic structure of the Worm but then what kinds of you know thing what kinds of biological     
1:00:32     
processes are going on if the worm is experiencing things in the environment     
1:00:38     
can we represent those things if the worm is represent you know experiencing     
1:00:43     
abnormal sorts of things like plasticity or um you know starvation or whatever     
1:00:49     
then we can model those things as well um so yeah and then this is these are     
1:00:54     
the different data sets that are available through sort of in in the adult sea elegans this is not including     
1:01:01     
dorm so we have data sets for dorm and those are in a separate place so I can     
1:01:08     
actually prepare for Lucas a list of our data sets and I think you know I've done     
1:01:14     
this for gach but I think it's useful for him to have some of these data sets     
1:01:19     
and to sort of go over them but I won't go over those right now I'll send them to him later uh maybe this week     
1:01:26     
uh but we have a number of data sets in the adult celegans where you know they're represented in different ways we     
1:01:33     
have the virtual worm which is the 3D atlas of seans anatomy we have the cgans     
1:01:39     
connectome which is this wearing diagram of connected neurons so it's basically a     
1:01:44     
a connection Matrix the cell list of celegans so the 3D Atlas gives     
1:01:50     
positional information and relational information the cellest is merely just a list of     
1:01:56     
cells the ion channels used by celan so I think Lucas has looked at this data     
1:02:02     
set where they talk about the ion channels and you know in celegans and again this is more of a list there's     
1:02:09     
some functional information but that's you know usually a description of what an channel is or what it does uh which     
1:02:17     
is useful but you know again there's all sorts of information we can have     
1:02:22     
annotations or we can have sort of dynamical information like you know     
1:02:27     
traces or you know uh some sort of uh you know something that something that     
1:02:35     
represents the ion channels at different points in time so you know these things     
1:02:40     
aren't static in the cell for example ion channels we have ION channel     
1:02:46     
expression they you know change their F you know they change their structure over the lifespan of seans they change     
1:02:53     
their function sometimes and so so this is important to know kind of those details but you know we have to start     
1:03:01     
somewhere and this is basically characterizing these ion channels and then there's the database of worm     
1:03:07     
behavioral phenotypes so this is the movement uh data where you know they     
1:03:13     
track worms uh using machine learning and they can figure out how the worm     
1:03:18     
moves the different patterns of movement and how they're related to different behaviors so we have all these data here     
1:03:26     
um and we have other there are other sub projects that are going on in openworm     
1:03:32     
that you know really have focused on this data uh     
1:03:38     
representation and you know kind of building these structures that allow us to have a uniform representation of the     
1:03:45     
different data types so this is really a focus of you know what we do in     
1:03:51     
openworm um and yeah this kind of goes through some of this so this is the documentation this is from the openworm     
1:03:59     
docs um and so that's an important thing I think for Lucas but also it's more     
1:04:05     
generally I think interesting um for people trying to understand what open     
1:04:11     
world is do okay so that's um all all I had for     
1:04:19     
that I wanted to go over that um more detail yeah     
1:04:26     
[Music] um if Lucas wants to say anything go     
1:04:31     
ahead but um I I'm I'm curious about that like     
1:04:37     
it's a lot of stuff that is sort of related to things that I've been exposed to so I don't know if there's a way to     
1:04:43     
help with that or otherwise see what happens with it um I think that'll be     
1:04:50     
um a very interesting project and definitely uh     
1:04:56     
data science related in terms of wrangling data sets so right     
1:05:03     
yeah yeah so yeah and Morgan said ankor syh is leading the gck students working     
1:05:10     
with theirl so there there are specific gck projects respect to neuroml and uh     
1:05:17     
you know developing that F format type and and some of the things around that     
1:05:22     
so that's yeah it's a that's something sponsored through um incf so we'll hear     
1:05:30     
more at CNS next month yeah yeah we'll probably talk about this more in in the Deva meetings um but you know in terms     
1:05:39     
of Json Json is a format that we use also and it wasn't mentioned in there too much but this is uh uh Java Java     
1:05:49     
object or a notation basically that's a a JavaScript object notation that's what Json stands for     
1:05:56     
and you know it allows us to like build this uh file it's basically a file that     
1:06:03     
describes something and it it will have the descriptors in it so it's basically     
1:06:08     
you know if you can find an example of a Json file and we'll probably walk through this in more detail later but     
1:06:15     
basically it has everything formatted in JavaScript it has like all the details     
1:06:20     
of your input data in JavaScript and and a computer can parse that information so     
1:06:26     
you have tags you have the information within the tag and then it'll go through     
1:06:32     
and read those information and it'll bring that into the simulation and it'll do so in a way     
1:06:39     
that's efficient for the computer and you know it's something you can read as a human but it's more meant     
1:06:45     
for a machine to read it you know so that the machine can then do the operations on the data um so that's     
1:06:54     
that's what Json is and I think I sent them a couple things on Json um I don't have them up here but     
1:07:01     
that's okay we can go through those later as well but I just sent them some     
1:07:07     
basic reading there isn't a whole lot on the web about Json in terms of like a tutorial or something but there's some     
1:07:14     
repositories uh where people been working on this and I know the movement uh the movement data in that we have an     
1:07:22     
open world use Json files very extensively so we can go through some of     
1:07:29     
that as well later uh yeah so congratulations again to Lucas for that     
1:07:38     
um okay so let me look     
1:07:45     
here yeah so I'm going to continue on I have a couple more things here to talk     
1:07:50     
about with respect to uh generative programming and some other things so in     
1:07:58     
our slack um paa pointed um pointed out this paper     
1:08:05     
and I that is interesting because you know it has to do with generative Ai and     
1:08:10     
sort of the categorical foundations of generative Ai and so she pointed this paper out in I think in the general     
1:08:17     
Channel and so I'll go over it a little bit and talk about it uh this is called     
1:08:22     
Gaia categorical foundations of General a generative AI a preprint by S her uh     
1:08:31     
mahad Devan and this person is at Adobe or at the University of Massachusetts in     
1:08:36     
Amherst Adobe research um and so they're interested in     
1:08:42     
the categor categorical foundations of generative AI specifically we     
1:08:47     
investigate a generative AI architecture of Gaia that lies Beyond back     
1:08:53     
propagation the longstanding algorithmic deep hor of deep Lear Workhorse of deep     
1:08:58     
learning uh back propagation is that's core a compositional framework for     
1:09:04     
unsupervised it can be conceptualized as a sequence of modules where each module updates its parameters based on     
1:09:11     
information it receives from Downstream modules and in turn transmits information back Upstream to modules     
1:09:19     
that guide their updates so Gaia is based on a fundamentally different hierarchical model so what they're     
1:09:25     
they're talking they kind of describe back propagation is this compositional framework where you have a sequence of     
1:09:32     
modules each module updates its parameters and then it sends things     
1:09:39     
Upstream uh and you know there's this sort of Upstream sort of cascade things     
1:09:45     
are uh collected in Downstream modules or modules that are Upstream that update     
1:09:50     
their parameters and then they have this feedback mechanism where in information     
1:09:55     
is sent back to guide updates so it's a classic feedback loop um in that sense     
1:10:04     
now this is you know Gaia is basically a different type of hierarchical model     
1:10:10     
modules and guia are organized into a simplical complex so yeah this is uh     
1:10:15     
back propagation then we get into Gaia modules and Gaia organized into a simplical complex so these are sort of     
1:10:22     
these topological uh like on like graphs so if you have shapes in a graph this is a     
1:10:29     
simplical complex um so each n simplical complex     
1:10:35     
acts like a manager of a business unit it receives updates from its superiors     
1:10:40     
and transmits information back to its N plus1 Subs simplical complexes that are     
1:10:45     
its subordinates so you know you have this idea that you know you have maybe     
1:10:51     
in back propagation you have this basic feedback loop the way we think of it kind of in     
1:10:57     
cybernetics so we have backrop and then Gaia which is over     
1:11:07     
here so in back propop we have this sort of cascade of different modules they go     
1:11:15     
upward to these different modules and they collect information     
1:11:21     
down here can go upward so it is hierarch iCal in this sense so     
1:11:28     
far and then but there's feedback between this module and this     
1:11:35     
module so it's like updating itself so you have information coming in     
1:11:40     
information being passed up to this one and then it gets it gets it just updates the state here the feedback is a time     
1:11:47     
thing Temple roll update and so that's where we are with     
1:11:53     
back propop in Gaia though we have a different kind of hierarchical system we have these simplical complexes and a     
1:12:00     
simplical complex is basically where you have a     
1:12:05     
shape that's represented in a graph so you have say for example this diamond     
1:12:11     
which is a a four Simplex so you have four nodes here they're connected this     
1:12:17     
way these can be B directional and this forms a simplical     
1:12:22     
complex and they use this in graph area often to you know sort of represent     
1:12:28     
different typologies so you can have triangles you can have diamonds they're     
1:12:33     
you know they call them three and four and five simplees so when they say n Simplex the N is just the number of     
1:12:39     
nodes in the simplex and so they they suggest that this is kind of like an or chart     
1:12:46     
basically where you have a manager and subordinates and so these directional     
1:12:53     
connections could be like subordinates reporting to managers you know this can be just     
1:13:00     
organized in any you know any sort of set of Pathways you want it's just that     
1:13:07     
there's some sort of like you know order in the way information is passed so it     
1:13:12     
could be passed upward it could be passed downward but there's this this sort of subordinate and managerial     
1:13:21     
relationship that's basically what they're getting out of this paper um     
1:13:27     
so each uh okay so it receives updates from its superiors and transmits that     
1:13:34     
information back to its N plus1 Subs simplical complexes that are its subordinates to ensure the simplical     
1:13:41     
generative AI organization behaves coherently guia builds upon the mathematics of higher order category     
1:13:47     
theory of simplical sets and objects so there's a whole category Theory you know we use simplical sets and objects or we     
1:13:55     
use simplical complexes in graph Theory and sometimes people will take a graph     
1:14:01     
and they'll find all this simplies of a certain order so n Simplex they might find all triangles in a graph topology     
1:14:09     
or all diamonds in a graph topology and they'll say that those are sort of these motifs that mean something and so when     
1:14:16     
you can discover those then you can you know say something about the structure of a     
1:14:21     
graph in this case we're looking at higher order category Theory so we're looking at sort of subsets and other     
1:14:27     
types of properties of the graph so we're looking at different types of uh     
1:14:34     
categorical relationships instead of just these simplies that are organized into     
1:14:41     
shapes and so this this tells us something about kind of the the structure of the network and how     
1:14:48     
information is passed through it so uh computations in Gaia from query     
1:14:54     
answering to found ation model building are opposed in terms of lifting diagrams over simplical objects problem of     
1:15:01     
machine learning and guia is modeled as a horn extension of simplical sets each Subs simplical complex tries to update     
1:15:08     
its parameters in such a way that it the lifting diagram is solved and so they     
1:15:13     
talk about lifting diagrams in this paper traditional approach is used in generative AI using back propagation can     
1:15:21     
be used to solve inner horn extension problems and so they get in all this this is very jargony uh and it kind of     
1:15:28     
goes through some of you know how this works they these uh weekly ordered     
1:15:35     
preserve preserving mappings uh the top level structure can be good the top level structure can be     
1:15:43     
viewed as a combinatorial factory for constructing manipulating and destructing complex objects that can be     
1:15:50     
built on a modular components defined over categories so basically     
1:15:55     
you can create different structures in the network that can be manipulated or     
1:16:01     
destroyed which is interesting uh so there are a lot of structures that get defined in terms of you know if you're     
1:16:09     
working in a certain problem type or problem space and you can modify the network over time um the second layer of     
1:16:17     
guia defines the building blocks of generative AI models as universal coalgebras over categories that can be     
1:16:23     
defined using current Genera ative AI approaches including Transformers that Define a category of permutation     
1:16:30     
equivariant functions and Vector spaces structured State space models that Define a category of linear dynamical     
1:16:37     
systems or image diffusion models that Define a probabilistic coalgebra or     
1:16:42     
ordinary differential equations so this gets very much into sort of uh you know     
1:16:48     
there's a lot of math involved in this and then um let's see the third layer of     
1:16:54     
in GUI as a category of elements over a relational database it defines the data over which Foundation models are go so     
1:17:01     
there's this relational element to U I think there's a lot of it's a very     
1:17:07     
complex paper but I think there's a lot here that's relevant to sort of you know     
1:17:12     
the good regulator theorem as as we'll see in the paper     
1:17:17     
that we have yet to review uh for that and a lot of other things uh with     
1:17:23     
respect to relational uh systems and things like that so it's definitely uh an interesting paper this     
1:17:31     
is sort of their model here they show these lifting diagrams um which I guess are just kind     
1:17:37     
of representations of these simplical complexes um and so you know they kind     
1:17:44     
of get into the details here um they show the hierarchical framework so you     
1:17:49     
actually have here this hierarchical framework of uh simplexes so you have     
1:17:56     
say for example a three simplex and a two simplex and a one simplex and a zero     
1:18:03     
simplex and those are all sort of hierarchical so the three Simplex is is     
1:18:09     
at a higher level the hierarchy than a two Simplex so you can move down from three simplexes down in complexity to     
1:18:17     
these zero simplexes which I guess are like just nodes in the network but you     
1:18:22     
know you're able to sort of organize those in a way that's functional and they act as a business unit in a company     
1:18:29     
that's the metaphor that they use but basically there's a mathematics to this     
1:18:34     
um and it allows you to sort of build these hierarchies into sets and objects     
1:18:41     
and things that you would need to uh process data coming into the system so     
1:18:46     
yeah this is a pretty interesting paper there a lot of connections to some of the things we're doing but I don't know     
1:18:53     
we can get our heads around it off to to do anything interesting with it but it     
1:18:58     
does raise a lot of questions there is that connection to category theory of course that we've talked about in the     
1:19:05     
past so the other thing I want to talk about is this work on program synthesis     
1:19:12     
and large language model creativity so I see that um that's Sor     
1:19:18     
had to leave but I have some you know this will be relevant to some of her interests large language model     
1:19:25     
mod so the first thing that you know this kind of brings up is this idea of     
1:19:31     
program synthesis and deep learning and this is uh based on Fran chol's work and this is     
1:19:40     
uh CRA I don't know who that is but um anyways they said here are my notes on     
1:19:46     
FR sh's NE explanation of the differences between deep learning and program synthesis so France is making     
1:19:55     
connections between deep learning and program synthesis and the advantages and disadvantages of each and how they that     
1:20:02     
fit together to build AGI so in deep learning your underlying     
1:20:08     
model is a differentiable curve so you have this curve that has this sort of     
1:20:13     
aspect where you can differentiate it and use uh calculus to get you know like     
1:20:19     
if you're looking at gradient descent you can get information about     
1:20:25     
any that function at any point in time and how that function evolves over time     
1:20:31     
so in deep learning this is what we're doing with a differentiable curve and that's of course one type of     
1:20:38     
uh computational learning and inogram synthesis which of course is not deep learning but it's a different type of     
1:20:45     
sort of problem space your model is a discrete graph of operators you're     
1:20:50     
picking from a set of operators and structuring it into that program so if you look at at this model here this this     
1:20:56     
shows the difference this picture so deep learning is where you have this surface this gradient descent surface     
1:21:04     
where you go from sort of the surface to this Minima space or this Minima Point down here in the space and so your your     
1:21:12     
path here is this curve that you see in black where it explores the space and it     
1:21:18     
tries to minimize its its loss and so in doing so it produces this curve that's     
1:21:23     
differentiable so that means it's a continuous curve that describes the space going down to this minimum or this     
1:21:31     
minimar this minimal point and so we can differentiate this curve and you know do     
1:21:37     
calculus on it and figure out like what the loss is and characterize this as a     
1:21:43     
loss function giving us a good rigorous mathematical background for it now if     
1:21:48     
you're kind of linking this to program synthesis you know it's a little bit     
1:21:53     
harder because you have this different problem space or it's this different type of problem and so this is how they     
1:22:00     
represent program synthesis in that space so what you're doing here instead of trying to minimize your error in this     
1:22:07     
in this space and getting a differentiable function is you have this     
1:22:12     
combinatorial search that happens your model is a discrete graph of operators     
1:22:18     
you're picking from a set of operators and structuring that into a program purple path is this path through that     
1:22:23     
space and putting together these different operators and linking them into a     
1:22:29     
program and so that's what you're doing here uh so then this has implications of     
1:22:35     
the amount of compute and data needed for each we want to use deep learning to do program synthesis but we can't     
1:22:42     
because they're different types of problems we use different types of underline     
1:22:47     
representations so in deep learning your learning engine is gradient descent which is very compute efficient you have     
1:22:54     
a very informative feedback signal about where the where the solution is so you have this feedback signal you know kind     
1:23:00     
of where you were you kind of know where you're going because it's a step that's minimizing things and you can keep track     
1:23:07     
of that and it's actually pretty easy to know kind of uh you also know where the solution is because you know it's the     
1:23:14     
absolute minimum the global minimum of course sometimes in in spaces that are     
1:23:19     
uh very rugged you can't really find the global minimum but you can use the     
1:23:24     
information that you have from your previous point to sort of find that Global minimum so there's this very     
1:23:31     
strong feedback signal um in program synthesis uh in in fact in deep learning     
1:23:37     
you need a dense sampling of the data distribution to get uh you know to have an efficient sort of minimization     
1:23:44     
process because again if you have this very rugged space you know you might get stuck in a local minimum and that's not     
1:23:51     
the global minimum and you can't you know reduce you can't minimize your error enough and the program you know     
1:23:59     
the Deep learning solution isn't optimal so you have this informative feedback     
1:24:04     
signal but you have a very data and efficient process so if you have a lot of data about your space your problem     
1:24:12     
you're okay if you don't then you don't uh in program synthesis you're     
1:24:17     
learning engine is combinatorial search this is extremely data efficient I believe because the problem space is     
1:24:24     
apparently more constrained that's is editorial but it's extremely compute inefficient because the search space is     
1:24:31     
massive so in this case uh sometimes it's data efficient because your problem     
1:24:37     
is constrained you may want to just write a program that does a certain thing and maybe they're only a finite     
1:24:43     
set of operators that you can use to represent that problem on the other hand you have this uh compute inefficient     
1:24:51     
issue because the search space is potentially massive how does this apply to     
1:24:56     
AGI so talks about deep learning being great for system one thinking discr     
1:25:02     
program search is great for system two thinking so you kind of use this system one and system two uh model where system     
1:25:10     
one and system two are different ways of thinking there's this sort of surface thinking and there's this deep thinking     
1:25:16     
and you know links that to system one and system two uh cognition AGI will     
1:25:23     
likely work or a combination of both approaches cholet expects that an AGI system will have an outer program that     
1:25:30     
does program synthesis and it will use deep learning to assist it so basically     
1:25:35     
you'll do program synthesis by running some sort of combinatorial search but also use deep learning not as like doing     
1:25:43     
program synthesis as deep learning but deep learning as a way to sort of uh you     
1:25:48     
know help constrain that that search space and then there's this blog post programming generating code in program     
1:25:55     
synthesis the changing paradigms and creating software so this talks a little bit about um chat GPT and using AI to     
1:26:05     
sort of do program synthesis and so um you know large     
1:26:11     
language models of course run on the basis of a transformer and you know so     
1:26:16     
we have these networks that are doing this sort of essentially things that are related to program synthesis building     
1:26:24     
the language models and then of course you can um generate code but the     
1:26:29     
question is can you synthesize a program efficiently using uh GPT and so it's     
1:26:35     
already possible for gpt3 derived AI models to do some interesting things so     
1:26:41     
there's this model called codex that generates code and allows you to you     
1:26:46     
know build programs that way there have already been products that can do this like GitHub     
1:26:52     
co-pilot uh or Code Pilot and open source ones like GPT code clippy but we     
1:26:58     
really reach the Holy Grail um how about generating the program instead of stopping at the code so you know we can     
1:27:05     
generate code and the code might make sense and it might not but we also want to generate programs and so this is     
1:27:13     
where they kind of kind of takes this next step and talks about program synthesis and how computers can programs     
1:27:20     
automatically by telling them what we want not just the code that we will need to compile but the programs I can run     
1:27:27     
directly so we had a comment here did we have the original shway discussion about     
1:27:33     
this well it's somewhere on X I don't know where it is uh but it's it's um you     
1:27:38     
know he has a I don't know if he has a Blog maybe put it up there but so yeah     
1:27:46     
um definitely curious about that and I feel     
1:27:53     
like I don't know if I'm going to do it but in infinite time Jesse was like oh man     
1:28:02     
let's let's not just compare the original tweet to system one system two     
1:28:09     
stuff let's compare it to metab brains and all of our work in that space and     
1:28:14     
you know like like use it as a means by wish to to kind of connect some stuff in our     
1:28:21     
sense um I don't know if I'm have time to do that but that like I think that's     
1:28:27     
that fits a bit with sort of the philosophy of computation stuff but also this I don't know I don't know what to call the space     
1:28:34     
where like uh I don't know metab brain stuff and then Yan laon's like oh well I think     
1:28:40     
there's six different components you know like that this all seems to be in that space and I don't know what that space is but but     
1:28:47     
I yeah I've been I've been putting that in Dev AI okay okay I mean I think that's where     
1:28:54     
I put that Arc stuff before yeah and like the machine learning Street talk yeah     
1:29:01     
yeah yeah it's kind of hard to classify because it's like what is this useful for not just what it is and I think it's     
1:29:08     
useful for a lot of things we're working on like you know the the cybernetic stuff but also like metab brains and we     
1:29:16     
can't forget about that and I think that would be useful um in some way here so     
1:29:24     
so there's definitely a conversation like to be demarcated and     
1:29:32     
maybe it is Dei but I'm glad I'm glad that we're continuing to mention that     
1:29:38     
one yeah uh a couple weeks ago I did like     
1:29:43     
when we I just did like an update for the lab so there's this uh interview     
1:29:49     
with Allison gnik and Melanie Mitchell on sort of the usefulness of development     
1:29:55     
and thinking about AI more generally I have it linked in the description of that video that was like two weeks ago     
1:30:01     
so you know that's something to read as well but anyways um yeah this is La     
1:30:06     
Review of Books exactly okay yes this is it so that's that's a really interesting     
1:30:11     
thing to dive into because there's just a lot there and it's they kind of have a very wide ranging conversation on um you     
1:30:18     
know intelligence and you know development and uh kind of this these     
1:30:25     
higher level representations these symbolic representations and so something else so that's program     
1:30:31     
synthesis and that's interesting but you know we also think about like what large     
1:30:36     
language models can do and so uh there's a couple papers I wanted to talk about     
1:30:42     
with respect to creativity and so creativity is a really interesting topic because famously of     
1:30:49     
course we like to say that um you know larg language models who maybe have some     
1:30:55     
level of humanlike intelligence but one of the things about humanlike intelligence is that it's not just about     
1:31:01     
memorizing facts and synthesizing things that there are things like creativity and emotion as you know we talked about     
1:31:08     
before so there are all these things that are kind of like you would expect     
1:31:13     
from an intelligence that you know we can't necessarily say are Hallmarks of     
1:31:19     
large language models but in this in this paper uh they talk about Divergent     
1:31:24     
creativity in humans and large language models so they kind of frame creativity     
1:31:30     
in terms of this thing that you know humans and large language models maybe have or don't have and being able to     
1:31:37     
compare those two things those two systems so you know you have humans and large language models of course the     
1:31:43     
problem with comparing those two is that you know we know kind of we don't really know what humans or larg Lang models are     
1:31:50     
doing necessarily but we do know that they produce a beh behavioral output and     
1:31:55     
so we can sort of analyze those maybe uh subjectively but still we can make     
1:32:02     
comparisons so uh the recent surge in the capabilities of large language models have led to claims that they are     
1:32:08     
approaching a level of creativity akin to human capabilities this idea sparked     
1:32:14     
a blend of excitement and apprehension however a critical piece that has been missing in this discourse is a     
1:32:20     
systematic evaluation of out large language model cre ity particularly in comparison to human Divergent     
1:32:28     
thinking okay so this is I guess like human creativity or human Divergent     
1:32:35     
thinking I don't really know what that means to bridge this Gap we leverage recent advances in creativity science to     
1:32:41     
build a framework for the in-depth analysis of Divergent creativity in both     
1:32:46     
state-of-the-art leared language models in a substantial data set of 100,000 humans so this is a pretty large human     
1:32:53     
data set and like you know there's a lot of variation in what people are doing in     
1:32:58     
terms of creativity it's really hard for one thing to to sort of characterize     
1:33:03     
creativity I mean it's kind of like one of these we know it when we see it type things and so what does it mean to be     
1:33:11     
creative uh what what are the sort of the Hallmarks of like Innovation or     
1:33:16     
making things kind of spontaneously I mean there are a lot of ways you can Define creativity so I think having a     
1:33:23     
huge human data set can give us sort of a baseline for that but then again you know maybe not we have to really kind of     
1:33:30     
know what you we have to have a really robust definition of creativity and then     
1:33:35     
we can maybe compare it to what large language models are doing which we don't know what they're doing under the hood     
1:33:41     
necessarily or how they're arriving at these these outputs but you we can make     
1:33:47     
some I guess good guesses uh we found evidence suggesting that larger language     
1:33:53     
models can indeed surpass human capabilities in specific creative     
1:33:58     
tasks such as divergent Association and creative writing so in this case they're     
1:34:03     
just saying that humans can do creative writing or language models can do better creative writing and that's kind of you     
1:34:10     
know I don't know if that means like it can generate more but I mean that could be you know uh but in     
1:34:18     
Divergent Association that's kind of like you know that's interesting but I don't know if that's really     
1:34:24     
uh Hallmark of creativity because it's like I can just make you know spous     
1:34:30     
associations and that's great but again you know what does it mean to be creative is it like more focused than     
1:34:37     
that um ar oh go ahead well I was just gonna say this is the beauty of of these     
1:34:43     
kinds of discussions you know in terms of actually trying to to to pin down what some of these     
1:34:51     
words mean um you know computationally or in     
1:34:57     
practice as opposed to our our what's the uh colloquial way of     
1:35:04     
using these words oh yeah yeah well yeah it's it's basically like what it you     
1:35:10     
know we know it when we see it like I I I think it's creative I mean that's creative if you build like a if you     
1:35:16     
paint some an abstract painting that's creative uh what how do you get to that is it just you just start slapping paint     
1:35:23     
on a c or yeah I mean and this was you know I mean remember remember when stable     
1:35:29     
diffusion came out oh yeah yeah you know I     
1:35:34     
mean yeah there there was a lot of you know how creative is this or how many     
1:35:40     
times do I need to kind of repeat this and before I find I find something     
1:35:45     
creative right where people were you know essentially using their eye to pick out the the creative the creative output     
1:35:53     
from hundreds you know pressing the button 100 times yeah     
1:36:00     
and I think yeah it's like uh and you can have things that are creative but they're not intentional like and I don't     
1:36:07     
know if that makes a difference maybe in humans it doesn't work that way maybe it's like you just spontaneously do     
1:36:12     
something and it's creative it might be that you have a very fixed process like artists will have a very fixed process     
1:36:19     
for creating something but you can also have like you know improvisation where you just kind of generate stuff and you     
1:36:27     
see how it flows and so that that's that's another thing to think about like there different definitions of     
1:36:33     
creativity within creativity right like right right right yeah it it also     
1:36:40     
slightly reminds me of of William James and his uh and his     
1:36:46     
um varieties of religious experience and and kind of just like like how obsessed     
1:36:54     
he was with like automatic rating for instance right yeah like like these these outputs     
1:37:01     
that yeah where the mind it's it's is yeah     
1:37:07     
supposed to be kind of out of the picture anyway yeah so our quantitative benchmarking     
1:37:14     
framework opens up New Paths for the development of more creative large language models but it also encourages     
1:37:20     
more granular importance in the distin developments that constitute human inventive thought processes compared     
1:37:28     
with those that can be artificially generated so this paper really kind of goes through this kind of     
1:37:34     
comparison um you know it's really like again you know you're     
1:37:39     
defining creativity in maybe a certain way maybe not I think they're kind of getting into     
1:37:46     
this idea of Divergent thinking where you know there's this Divergence from a plan or this Divergence from from other     
1:37:55     
like models you know so human brains might diverge from a plan a cultural     
1:38:01     
plan or you know might generate new things same thing with large language models where you have language models     
1:38:08     
that are behaving differently again the question is is that something that we want or is that something that's     
1:38:15     
actually creative or is it just generating stuff and there's no like underlying aspect to it because there is     
1:38:23     
you there are models of improvisation there's there processes that sometimes artists will go through     
1:38:29     
to create things there are a lot of it's not just a halfhazard mish mash things     
1:38:35     
and so that's um you know and it kind of goes through um how we think about this     
1:38:41     
idea of Divergent thinking so um uh so there's something called the alternative     
1:38:47     
uses test in which people generate novel uses for common objects um     
1:38:54     
and so you know larg langua models they've used this alternative uses test but it's not been really     
1:39:00     
conclusive um in some cases there are no overall significant differences between     
1:39:06     
large language models and humans uh and so this uh the results     
1:39:12     
might be explained by inherent challenges in the methodology so this is one method uh     
1:39:18     
there's also semantic distance which is a a key component of creative thoughts so this is where you have uh different     
1:39:26     
things like the Divergent Association task which people are asked to generate a list of 10 words that are as     
1:39:33     
semantically distant from one another as possible so they'll take words and they'll have some semantic distance     
1:39:39     
metric where the meaning is is has some level of Divergence and then they'll build a network of words and they'll say     
1:39:47     
okay well let's take a bunch of words that are as semantically distant from each other as possible now let's see if     
1:39:53     
people can make connections between them and uh you know kind of cover a larger     
1:39:59     
semantic space so individuals who are more creative tend to cover a larger     
1:40:04     
semantic repertoire resulting in a larger mean semantic distance between the words while the DAT predominantly     
1:40:12     
probes creative uh creativity through language its results have been found to correlate with other established     
1:40:18     
creativity tests such as the alternative uses test and so we can use something     
1:40:23     
like Divergent Association specifically for large language models because it correlates with the alternative uses     
1:40:30     
test and other tests as well so that's kind of what they're going with here uh there's also Divergent semantic     
1:40:36     
integration which is a measure of cosine similarity between Pairs of successive word embeddings presented in a textual     
1:40:43     
narrative this approach was implemented in light of more recent advances and language modeling allowing the     
1:40:49     
computation of context dependent word embeddings so this actually correlates strong with human ratings of creativity     
1:40:56     
and short narratives um and yeah so they they kind of talk about the methods here that     
1:41:02     
they're using um and then they're showing their results and U yeah I don't     
1:41:08     
want to get too much into this paper because I have other papers I want to talk about but that's one of the papers     
1:41:14     
here is thinking about Divergent creativity um this uh article is a robot     
1:41:21     
walks into a bar and can language models serve as creativity support tools for     
1:41:26     
comedy so this is the idea of creating comedy yeah yeah that's Corey mat yeah     
1:41:32     
yeah yeah is is is Cory mat in is from Deep Mind well so one there's uh there's     
1:41:41     
I think three brothers and and so the others uh a     
1:41:48     
cognitive Neuroscience professor at Alberta okay and     
1:41:53     
the third is doing something too so you know you can only imagine family gatherings yeah but yeah Corey did     
1:42:03     
um um what's that organization like like creative     
1:42:08     
destruction um anyway he was he's with with one     
1:42:14     
group that was kind of um anyway he he also does improv okay     
1:42:21     
yeah yeah that's the important though yeah yeah yeah that that's that's what I know from okay yeah that's good uh so     
1:42:30     
yeah they're trying to basically I guess creative support tools for comedy I don't know what that is let's see so     
1:42:37     
they interviewed 20 professional comedians who perform live shows in front of audiences and who use     
1:42:43     
artificial intelligence in their artistic process as part of three-hour workshops on AI times comedy which I     
1:42:50     
guess is equals tragedy in time or something I don't know um but this is basically where they're     
1:42:56     
using uh some sort of artificial intelligence to help in their creative process so it's not actually relying on     
1:43:03     
these tools it's using them as part of that process so um this was at the     
1:43:09     
Edinburgh F Festival Fringe in August 2023 and online so the workshop     
1:43:15     
consisted of a comedy writing session with large language models a human computer interaction questionnaire to     
1:43:22     
assess the creativity support index of AI so we talked about that and a focus     
1:43:28     
group interrogating The Comedians motivations for and processes of using AI as well as their ethical concerns     
1:43:35     
about bias censorship and copyright uh participants noted that     
1:43:41     
existing moderation strategies us used in safety filtering and instruction tun     
1:43:46     
large language models reinforc tonic viewpoints by erasing minority groups     
1:43:52     
and their perspective perspectives and qualified this as a form of     
1:43:57     
censorship so yeah that was I guess Jesse something to say about that uh     
1:44:04     
yeah I mean I just very relevant to a lot of stuff that I'm looking at so     
1:44:11     
yeah yeah so this is very consistent with like a lot of the stuff in in the     
1:44:16     
yeah ethics literature on like how you know large langu generic large language     
1:44:21     
models are trained on basically or Society you know and it kind of perpetuates the biases of the     
1:44:28     
society and uh yeah so this is important to understand that when you're using it     
1:44:34     
as part of this creative process at the same time most participants felt that     
1:44:39     
large language models did not succeed as a creativity support tool by producing     
1:44:44     
Bland and biased comedy tropes AK kind to cruise ship comedy material from the     
1:44:49     
1950s but a bit less racist okay that's great that's interesting to note because     
1:44:55     
that's like obviously you know if you trained an AI or a larger language model     
1:45:00     
and say like sitcoms it would have like certain tropes certain themes that would come up again and again it would pick up     
1:45:06     
on those themes reinforce them this is interesting this this phrase just the way it's stated cruise ship comedy     
1:45:13     
material from the 1950s but a bit less racist so um not not racist well yeah     
1:45:23     
yeah yeah it this uh this reminds me of um the Cards Against     
1:45:30     
Humanity developers did a live stream of their     
1:45:36     
writing team versus llm yeah oh [Laughter]     
1:45:45     
really which is you know it was a it was a fun event to they were raising money     
1:45:52     
for something you know it was for a good cause that's     
1:45:58     
great or okay definitely definitely worth um Googling Corey though uh or you     
1:46:06     
know checking Corey's Google Scholar for other I I know he's done     
1:46:12     
other interesting you know cre creative uses of of machine     
1:46:19     
learning because because of his work at Improv right yeah yeah this is so this     
1:46:26     
is I think a wide open area I mean obviously you know there's the study     
1:46:31     
this is like the human computer interaction study of this there's also the sort of the more technical aspect of     
1:46:37     
like can we build something that's creative and what does that mean there's the human and uh machine comparisons so     
1:46:47     
you know how do we say that like what's you know defining creativity in humans and then okay do machines reflect that     
1:46:54     
and then of course you know working with machines in hand with humans and you know if those things are helpful or not     
1:47:02     
so this this work oh go ahead well I was just gonna say and and you know like you     
1:47:08     
were saying like well if I I'll I'll know it when I see it yeah yeah you know like like com comedy is kind of one of     
1:47:15     
those things right and um uh also just talking about Dev AI you know it it's um     
1:47:24     
anybody who has kids knows that they go through this this stage you know yeah     
1:47:31     
you know like my daughter is kind of there right now and where she's she's     
1:47:37     
trying to tell jokes yeah and she's really just kind of feeling me out in terms of like is this     
1:47:44     
funny yeah you know and I'm like no you know     
1:47:50     
you're just you're kind of just stating facts yeah this is this is joke yet yeah     
1:47:56     
yeah and anyway yeah so it's pretty it's again super interesting when you kind of     
1:48:03     
try to get down to you know defining in a more accurate way what what we're     
1:48:09     
talking about with you know comedy or humor things like that yeah yeah so yeah     
1:48:14     
to finish this up uh they they do mention that our work extends scholarship about the subtle difference     
1:48:21     
between on the one hand harmful speech and on the other hand offensive language is a practice of resistance satire and     
1:48:28     
punching up so yeah there's a certain structure to like something that's funny usually if it's like making fun of uh     
1:48:35     
like punching down you know it's like that's not considered funny punching up is NE considered funnier uh to most     
1:48:43     
people I guess uh so there are certain rules in humor that are like you know     
1:48:48     
expected by the audience and if you violate those then it's not um     
1:48:54     
considered funny so yeah I mean there are a lot of social rules that the AI has to be aware of and that's part of     
1:49:02     
the pro maybe part of the problem here so sure it it' be it'd be really good to     
1:49:08     
look at this then revisit um steuart Lee is a kind very famous comedian in the UK     
1:49:16     
but he does great talks about writing and and kind of like about his process     
1:49:22     
process I I know he he gave he went to Oxford he gave a talk at a     
1:49:28     
college like I can't remember now but St cathine or something like that but um     
1:49:36     
yeah just in terms of of trying to his his attempt to try to     
1:49:43     
Define what he's doing yeah this is just a kind of a finishing     
1:49:49     
thing this is data from Star Trek next Generation painting and this was a theme in this     
1:49:56     
show because like data actually at one point did like standup comedy and it     
1:50:01     
wasn't funny at all would just like make jokes that were like observations like you said and people weren't laughing and     
1:50:09     
he couldn't figure out why they weren't laughing so he would go around to the different crew members and ask like why     
1:50:14     
isn't this funny and they couldn't really tell him why I mean they were kind of they kind of had an answer but     
1:50:19     
it wasn't like you know defend they couldn't give them instructions how to be funny necessarily so I think that is     
1:50:25     
an interesting kind of point and then of course that is painting here and you     
1:50:31     
know a similar thing can happen with painting you know are you painting something that's creative or is it just     
1:50:38     
kind of a fa simile of something else and you know there there are a lot of things that you know if you had an     
1:50:44     
Android doing them they would be a lot you know the the Android might not understand the social conventions the     
1:50:50     
sort of the process which we take for granted and for humans it's it's     
1:50:56     
procedural knowledge right it's not descriptive you can't describe how it is     
1:51:01     
to be funny but you can do you can be creative right yes um there's a lot of things to     
1:51:10     
say and I'll say that when we're done talking about this stuff so I don't know if there's more you want to say well I     
1:51:16     
think that's it for me okay um one of the things that I'll say that     
1:51:24     
um major shout out to Avery who's not here um but is always with us at least     
1:51:30     
always with me in spirit um I     
1:51:38     
think one of the things that something that that totally JS out to me that     
1:51:43     
Avery is working on     
1:51:49     
um and it's sort of this you know only at Liberty to say things and and I only     
1:51:55     
understand so much of it as well but I think what it's tied a little bit there     
1:52:02     
there's an extreme version of my comment in um in the chat about our humans that     
1:52:08     
creative but I think I think I want to tag Avery here and say     
1:52:15     
Avery is doing some really really really cool deep stuff in in their     
1:52:23     
time uh about identifying like why why think there's     
1:52:30     
something about humor something about improv something about creativity that is absolutely not     
1:52:37     
about it's totally not um I don't want to use the word     
1:52:43     
intellectual or mental but all about circumstance and context and it's and     
1:52:49     
and and why like like the there's a     
1:52:55     
there's an element that is very much implicit reference to other things     
1:53:02     
not just not just like World model but actually like like even punching up or punching down I think is a great way to     
1:53:08     
think about this because punching over punching down is a     
1:53:15     
relative um it's it's a it's a very specific kind     
1:53:21     
of divide it's a very spefic specific kind of alternative that requires a very specific     
1:53:27     
context so shout out to Avery who is developing I would say theories but also     
1:53:33     
like they're they're working on a theory about uh per you know like a lot of a     
1:53:40     
lot of Aver work is sort of this almost like applied may not applied but like a phenomenological investigation of     
1:53:47     
certain experiences and how that like what is the spectrum of experience in the space that's what a a lot of Avery's     
1:53:53     
Theory work is about that at at a certain level and I it's fascinating to     
1:53:58     
be like around somebody who just sort of comes up with this stuff as a byproduct of you know so I'm me I'll leave it at     
1:54:06     
that and and and say that's that's awesome and there's something there and then I'm kind of in the rest of whatever     
1:54:13     
however long I talk about this there's sort of the controversial hat about     
1:54:19     
humans in creativity but then also like like there's there's part of the     
1:54:26     
discussion what it I had such mixed feelings when you're going over the paper because one of it's like and also     
1:54:32     
I want to say about uh data later too um but the paper that we just went over I     
1:54:38     
had very mixed not mixed but like conflicting I guess feelings in the sense of     
1:54:46     
one yeah absolutely I want to look into this this guy the background of improv I've mentioned a lot of things about d     
1:54:51     
and d and creating few weeks ago I'm not going to reash it here but I it's a fascinating space and     
1:54:57     
and and the ability to communicate across those things um is is really     
1:55:04     
interesting but also sort of there's a bit of it where it's like creativity is is sort of talked about     
1:55:11     
like measuring intelligence and measuring creativity in that way of like okay like are     
1:55:18     
we a little bit of like     
1:55:24     
talking about creativity like it's a certain either amount that you have or     
1:55:30     
like a lot of the things you said about oh is like you press the button 100 times and see when you when you to the     
1:55:35     
creativity and it's sort of like there's a very weird and uncomfortable way of     
1:55:40     
talking about creativity or intelligence or like sort of like the IQ level or the     
1:55:47     
creativity quotient of something it's like not even the sense of being against those been more     
1:55:54     
like I I have such a strong pull away from that at times where it's much more     
1:55:59     
about what there's sort of a veilance or a     
1:56:06     
magnitude of appeal of creativity that affects a certain like what's what's     
1:56:12     
what is what is creativity to different people you know it's not uniform like what what's what's what is a relative     
1:56:19     
creativity versus what is old hat and tierson you know like if you've been watching me for a long time not that     
1:56:25     
interesting to say but it's like you know there's there's all of those things are of play but then also sort of like     
1:56:33     
what is our model for creativity and our humans there's a certain to put on the     
1:56:38     
controversial hat fully that I said um     
1:56:43     
I I think I think there's there's one painful uh approach to the creativity     
1:56:51     
common of hum like man like humans in in certain domain spaces you know there's a     
1:56:58     
lot of like variability but in in many many other ones it's it's uh     
1:57:06     
extremely um there there's so much     
1:57:13     
uh [Music] um     
1:57:19     
monolithic let's say and and so I even feel like creativity if you change the     
1:57:26     
bounds of as a human or as an entity or as a whatever like there's some weird     
1:57:32     
relevance to embodiments but also social stuff and it goes in all these different directions and it's just I don't know     
1:57:38     
there there's sort of a really substantial part of the paper that it's like okay yes and there's also this     
1:57:45     
these Avenues where I feel like you know and so that's that's that's great but     
1:57:51     
those are just the different many different reactions that I had to that yeah I think domain specificity is     
1:57:57     
really interesting because if you think about like you know we talked about large language models and some of the tests they use there and you can do some     
1:58:04     
very specific tests with large language models and human like kind of L     
1:58:10     
linguistic creativity so you can look at like you know Vector spaces you can look at you know uh different semantic     
1:58:17     
distances and things like that and it's pretty easy to represent sort of you     
1:58:23     
know a standard output versus a creative output and say okay this is more creative than that and then that's in     
1:58:30     
that a domain then if we move to a domain like painting or you know some sort of visual art that's a totally     
1:58:37     
different space you're going to use a totally different type of model you're going to use a large language model you     
1:58:42     
might use something like U you know some sort of neural network or you know some sort of generative model where you can     
1:58:50     
generate images uh and then you know you can evaluate those but it's a different     
1:58:55     
maybe set of Criterion for what's creative or not and then you know of     
1:59:00     
course we have the false positives which we don't think about in creativity but like I mentioned before you have you     
1:59:07     
know how do you know you're doing something creative versus something that's just kind of gibberish and and I     
1:59:13     
say that in kind of a judgmental way because you know if you think about like a Jackson Pollock painting you know it's     
1:59:21     
like throwing paint at a at a canvas and that's that's valuable people that's     
1:59:27     
creative but it's you know is that really just maybe kind of like just you know random Behavior you saw that in the     
1:59:35     
machine would you think that that was creative I mean you know that's I guess that's and so it's a very slippery     
1:59:42     
Criterion too so you can't just say something is creative because it     
1:59:47     
diverges from the norm you know I don't know or maybe you can I don't know yeah and there's so     
1:59:55     
much like you can read I forget I forget the name of it one of my friends would     
2:00:00     
always would always tell me about it but like you can you can like you can read a piece of     
2:00:07     
literature and you know if it's your first time reading it it's one thing if     
2:00:14     
I if you not they just like the first pth but you know some books you read multiple times sure but also like     
2:00:20     
there's even even I think I think even like the art comment or even like Picasso or or whatever a lot of their     
2:00:29     
alleged creativity is in the context of the entire history of the domain of of     
2:00:35     
that being an artist of of being a writer a lot of a lot of writing is or very impressive     
2:00:44     
writing is what like why is it impressive or creative why why is it of substance because there's a     
2:00:52     
implicit connection to other things whether it's other artifacts that have been made that the user the agent is     
2:00:59     
exposed to or um it touches     
2:01:04     
upon a common an experience oh you you're the universal Human Condition     
2:01:12     
stuff you know that that too so I I almost think creativity is one thing but     
2:01:18     
I think almost a more Salient like I want to override with this stuff and say     
2:01:24     
well some of the the the I don't really like the word value but the the     
2:01:29     
compulsion of feeling something of substance about     
2:01:34     
it has to do with like I don't associate that with     
2:01:39     
creativity I see that as more connection like like resonance I guess I guess I'm     
2:01:45     
saying the word resonance I'm not sure I want to go in the fuk sense of it but like there's a resonatory like oh yeah     
2:01:52     
there's some there's there's there's a strong uh uh communication     
2:01:58     
between uh the the the the what the art or the experience of the writing the the     
2:02:05     
artifact the thing that's happening and inside the person as well and I think     
2:02:11     
that's is that creativity I don't know like I'm kind of in this in this moment     
2:02:17     
I'm pooing the idea of creativity and more well it's it seems to be more     
2:02:22     
what does it mean like phenomenologically inside the person do they find it creative do they find it does speak to them in some way you know     
2:02:29     
and so that we don't you know that's a different angle perhaps     
2:02:37     
yeah I thought it was interesting excuse me we haven't uh I don't think we've     
2:02:42     
brought up the um uh what's this the author's name um the     
2:02:49     
Berkeley linguist uh um he did the paper um you know just     
2:02:57     
large to large language models you know refute Chomsky oh begins with a p um     
2:03:04     
anyway you've got a new paper you know language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought okay     
2:03:12     
yeah I thought I saw a reference yeah did I share it you said that I saw that somewhere yeah I mean again I I put this     
2:03:19     
in Dei um uh you know de has a bit of a catch     
2:03:27     
for don't fit other places but but um     
2:03:32     
uh you know so one just getting at this this you know this discussion about     
2:03:39     
creativity and and you know people working you know again like James     
2:03:45     
working on automatic writing um others in terms of you know G you know trying     
2:03:52     
to trying to inspire writers to to you know get over writer block or things     
2:03:57     
like that like you know these these you again just this this idea that like the     
2:04:04     
the Wellspring is is something Beyond language you know it's it's something     
2:04:12     
something else and that what we're what we're trying to do is to to then find     
2:04:17     
the words right and you know that that those words con convey the experience to     
2:04:24     
the you know to another person yeah and and being being that     
2:04:31     
that's the only you know that is our only communication system and     
2:04:36     
and I I a little bit maybe more grounded     
2:04:42     
on this is is something that I thought was really interesting just um     
2:04:48     
uh was someone used language to explore well to help people     
2:04:56     
explore smell space okay and and you know     
2:05:04     
um so there's there's a lot of reasons for that but but one of those being you know     
2:05:11     
like like people just being unused to um finding finding words to     
2:05:20     
express experiences you know complex experiences right and and yet they're     
2:05:28     
you know it's funny how U you know if if     
2:05:34     
you're if you're trying wines you know like if you ask somebody     
2:05:39     
like what does that you know taste like and they'll be like that tastes tastes like red wine or something like that but     
2:05:46     
but when somebody's with experience gives you some words and gives you some     
2:05:53     
some um yeah some some words that capture just say little parts of that     
2:05:58     
about like you know H hints of this hints of that and and your your     
2:06:06     
recognition you know that like oh yeah that that is my experience yeah yeah     
2:06:11     
like like like that that I thought is interesting just in terms of um yeah     
2:06:18     
that maybe we are um just unpracticed in     
2:06:25     
describing uh um some some experiences yeah is that is that in that article or     
2:06:31     
where do that that yeah that's so so um I I put that on Celsius slack because     
2:06:39     
they're we're coming we're doing a um we're doing a special workshop on sense     
2:06:45     
um like like synthetic bio but I'll find it yeah yeah yeah I think I think one of     
2:06:52     
my current Fascinations is exactly I said it earlier today but that's it's     
2:06:57     
going from a space of a certain degree of nuance furthering nuance and     
2:07:03     
Alternatives that that offer new degrees of specificity like that whatever like     
2:07:09     
that that's a super like everything is that but like I'm I'm really curious to see people talking about that because I     
2:07:17     
I need to find much better language about it to to just get my grounding there but like then it smell like the     
2:07:23     
the example of I think Wiest is a great example because I'm haven't had that much of it     
2:07:30     
over time and I'm always really agitated about like this oh the description says     
2:07:36     
this but to me it means this that is like it's this very uncoordinated space that's clumsy and awkward and I think     
2:07:42     
that's a really relevant place that for me to like think about it but also to try to express to other people like the     
2:07:49     
degree of nuance and what it's like to be able to do that and it I think there's also a it's different when it's     
2:07:56     
sort of there's something also specifically about like tenability or like Within Reach of it     
2:08:05     
because people already have the Spectrum or the range or the domain space     
2:08:13     
of smells or tastes somewhat like you're coming into the situation with a lot of     
2:08:19     
those points demarcated or have reference points oh this is the far end of the shower Spectrum you know or the     
2:08:25     
you know and it's sort of like but there's a separate thing of expanding     
2:08:31     
that whole space that if it doesn't happen first adding fancy language about it won't won't make a difference so I     
2:08:38     
think that's what whatever that is that's something and I think that's     
2:08:44     
something I want to look more into sort of extrapolation versus interpolation you can interpolate within that space     
2:08:50     
versus having new experience it's outside of that space so I've I've only got a I've only     
2:08:58     
got a poster so far actually so I just put it in Devi so it's it's a it's a     
2:09:04     
postto and in um I forget the brain Imaging Center but anyway you can you     
2:09:10     
can you can zoom in on the poster behind oh yeah image here okay yeah yeah yeah     
2:09:17     
yeah in odor is not worth a thousand tokens it's he's he's probably doing     
2:09:23     
something much more um you know know neural like like there     
2:09:30     
was a great uh I forgot to post this but the um the brain um brain meeting is the     
2:09:37     
the you know functional Imaging lab Institute of Neurology meeting in London     
2:09:42     
um had Chris Summerfield this this week yeah yeah anyway really really     
2:09:48     
interesting talking about the the the the the the matches between you know     
2:09:54     
artificial neural networks and biological neural networks in terms of processing I I I I think I think this is     
2:10:02     
this is much more aligned with with that but I but you know as as someone who's     
2:10:10     
um uh got family members who who have Wineries and and yeah like I I think     
2:10:17     
there's something there in terms of trying to give people you know like the     
2:10:23     
experience people have when you when you start to give them     
2:10:28     
a you know a language of expression for for experiences that they they they     
2:10:34     
absolutely recognize once once you give them those words you know yeah and it's     
2:10:40     
it's actually just something that you need to practice and it it's it's a little like ninger talking about um     
2:10:47     
reinforcement of random Behavior where he's just like like you can't you can't sit people you know you don't give     
2:10:54     
people a violin and expect them to start playing like you you have to you have to guide them yeah you know and teach them     
2:11:02     
but then then they can absolutely find that that expressively and um uh anyway     
2:11:10     
I I think it I think it interacts with the um what's the p p dois no what's     
2:11:18     
theeley I'm GNA get into that in a minute but oh yeah so this is interesting because     
2:11:23     
we've been we did a little bit of work on like associating like odors with like     
2:11:29     
uh other types of stimuli like light stimuli in brenberg vehicles and so there might be like there might be     
2:11:35     
something here I know they're using large language models here but like kind of parsing that out kind what kinds of     
2:11:41     
models can we use to do these associations so we could use brenberg     
2:11:46     
Vehicles we could also use metab brain to look at that problem yeah it and it     
2:11:52     
it's got some really it you know like from a sensory perspective it's really interesting in kind of the complexities     
2:12:00     
of um context and how context changes the experience so so with taste and     
2:12:07     
smell um previous you know tastes and smells can absolutely change your your     
2:12:14     
you know kind of local experience yeah of that right and um but you can do you     
2:12:21     
can do you know but you can do this in a in a you know still kind of     
2:12:26     
psychophysics way right you know right um which is really     
2:12:32     
interesting yeah so I'm gonna get to this before we go this is I pulled up the paper so this is yeah piad DOI I     
2:12:40     
guess is pad DOI yeah he he did a couple of uh talks at the um I can't remember     
2:12:48     
what that was the old Cafe that they used to have on fray the neurot talks oh learning Salon yeah     
2:12:56     
learning Sal he did he's done a he did a learning Salon it was really interesting um so     
2:13:02     
this is a Pap it's a new nature paper language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought so the     
2:13:11     
abstract of this of course is language is a defining characteristic characteristic of our species but the     
2:13:17     
function or functions that it serves been as been debated for centuries so     
2:13:23     
this is where of course you know uh in larger language models I think there's this uh aspect of language being as a     
2:13:31     
tool for thought like you know whatever the larger language model is thinking is     
2:13:36     
what's generated in terms of language uh or or linguistic content and what     
2:13:42     
they're saying here is it's actually communication so you know language is useless without communication you have     
2:13:48     
to communicate to other human or could be agents or whatever uh to to get any     
2:13:55     
meaning out of language so here we bring recent evidence from neuroscience and ly     
2:14:01     
disciplines to argue that in modern humans language is a tool for communication contrary to a prominent     
2:14:07     
view that we use language for thinking so this aspect of languages communication is key really to the whole     
2:14:14     
aspect of like context but also creativity because you know if something     
2:14:19     
is creative it has to be creative and context uh We Begin by introducing the brain Network that supports linguistic     
2:14:26     
ability in humans we then review evidence for a double dissociation     
2:14:31     
between language and thought so you knock out the thought aspect and you just have the language and then you know     
2:14:37     
you can do that same thing with thought you can have thought without language although it's hard to really Express     
2:14:42     
thought without language which is kind of the problem they're kind of disentangle or they're kind of entangled     
2:14:49     
in a way that is it sort of implies that one necessitates the other but     
2:14:57     
maybe you know it's really about communication more than thought and then discuss several properties of language     
2:15:04     
that suggests that it's optimized for communication so it's not that language is not involved in thought it's that     
2:15:09     
it's optimized for communication rather than thought and of course you know if we think about something we can describe     
2:15:16     
things in different amounts of detail it's really about you know thinking is     
2:15:22     
you know kind of well I guess you can think in like you know you could think in car mathematical terms and that would     
2:15:29     
be different from thinking in in sort of descriptive terms and those you know those are different kinds of Expressions     
2:15:36     
so you know but but to optimize those you have to have communication you have to like go back to the literature or     
2:15:43     
talk to someone about it and you can like then kind of you know narrow your     
2:15:48     
representation or refine your representation we conclude that although the emergence     
2:15:53     
of language is unquestionably transformed human culture language does not appear to be a prerequisite for     
2:15:59     
complex thought including symbolic thought so we don't need to have     
2:16:05     
language to have complex or symbolic thoughts we can represent our thoughts in pure mathematics which I guess is a     
2:16:12     
language but it's not you know you don't need to have like a you know a natural     
2:16:17     
language like English to do it but of course you know I don't know know if we could really reasonably do you know only     
2:16:24     
communicate in you know uh something that isn't a natural language instead     
2:16:32     
language is a powerful tool for the transmission of cultural knowledge so this is where uh you know where you get     
2:16:38     
into cultural Evolution and transmitting ideas to you know and then of course in     
2:16:44     
cultural Evolution you have a lot of recombination processes so it's not just     
2:16:50     
uh create ity but it's like if you communicate cultural knowledge sometimes     
2:16:55     
that cultural knowledge mutates sometimes it recombines you know and and     
2:17:00     
then there are different rules for that if you look at the cultural Evolution literature they've tried to model this     
2:17:07     
process uh and so this is tied to you know the evolution of of culture and the     
2:17:13     
evolution of language uh it it plausibly coevolved with their thinking and reasoning     
2:17:18     
capacities and only reflect rather than gives rise to the signature sophisticated sophistication of human     
2:17:27     
cognition so that's that paper and yeah again I think they make really good points there especially with respect to     
2:17:34     
how you know language is kind of tied to cultural Evolution and we can actually     
2:17:40     
look at creativity as a an artifact of cultural Evolution because what we're     
2:17:45     
doing is we're basically evolving culture when we're creating so yeah I     
2:17:51     
think that's actually much better way to think about it because that that that it's it's it's implicitly referencing     
2:17:58     
all this other stuff so to say to sort of treat it like it's this abstract qualiity is a bit like the you know     
2:18:05     
right in the bat stuff it's just this mind that calculates things there just a creativity of you know it's like it's     
2:18:11     
like it's like so if that's what that's what felt so wrong earlier it's like oh creativity as this thing that just     
2:18:18     
exists abstracted away from any context and very creative and it's like no no no     
2:18:24     
no it like there's it's not disconnect so yeah um and that's that's a little     
2:18:31     
bit of well yeah I had one other comment that's I'll say after theer discussion     
2:18:38     
okay well yeah I think that's it I mean for today but if you want to say what you want to say it was the last thing     
2:18:45     
just for for myself or for to put in here if I I go back on Qui this I put it     
2:18:50     
in chat it said I'm trying to interpret what I said again broader context of acceptability to explore play and safely     
2:18:57     
experience things I think this was sort of a I was thinking about it when Morgan was getting into the bit about like you     
2:19:03     
don't uh you don't um when you give someone a violin they just don't start     
2:19:08     
playing you have to kind of initiate them through it you do that sort of thing but also uh what again culturally     
2:19:16     
and all this other broader stuff in the sense of I think there's something to one of the things that I don't think     
2:19:23     
we're talking about enough right now and this goes all the way back to my commentary on what would present day Norbert weiner say about a lot of things     
2:19:31     
in terms of his sense of how computation or cybernetics would afford nuances of     
2:19:39     
experience what we we don't talk about now and what I'm very very extremely interested in this to the extent that     
2:19:45     
it's a driving factor in a lot of things um kind of person studies related kind     
2:19:50     
of of uh um broader aims even mental health working group and other things is     
2:19:57     
uh there's an extreme difference     
2:20:03     
in not everywhere but in the world as it as at least from what I can tell because     
2:20:09     
I haven't lived in times before this but the arena in which     
2:20:15     
to express like like there are factors that have constrained     
2:20:21     
why languages of expression of experience have not happened before and     
2:20:27     
and some of it is simply because there wasn't any means by which to comparatively communicate like yes     
2:20:34     
internet but also like the means by which there was a common enough frame of     
2:20:40     
reference or Viewpoint or technology to assist it and sort of the vantage point you know essay that I talked about     
2:20:46     
before that wasn't that wasn't even uh like there wasn't enough like preliminary     
2:20:52     
scaffolding at a broad level to do it and so I I I'm I have     
2:20:58     
this I don't really know what to call it but there's a specific graph in my mind     
2:21:03     
that I have been working on for several months that touches upon what I'm saying     
2:21:09     
and I'm I'm basically just saying this here as like there are very specific differences like there there are reasons     
2:21:15     
certain things haven't haven't had the means by which to be     
2:21:21     
developed relative to the uh uh ease of     
2:21:28     
interacting with other like like there's a reason why uh in the context of that     
2:21:34     
article there's a reason why we put we put someone on the moon we put spaceships in in in space uh because     
2:21:41     
of take away any normative stuff take away any like hard science soft science whatever the means by which to have a     
2:21:49     
number of people associatively like like sharing a context or how to work on a problem is     
2:21:56     
very different um and and there are there are things that have F us that over over time like Civilization we're     
2:22:02     
in a very different vantage point now than we ever have been before yeah and as such it allows there's new to to     
2:22:09     
Center back on like the Expressions thing there's a there's there's new things in that space that have always     
2:22:16     
existed but haven't really had the means by which to have have uh     
2:22:23     
popularity um and and potentially built off that way so this is mostly I'm     
2:22:28     
saying this kind of to myself right when I look back to the video I know it's really vague but um it's I really enjoy     
2:22:35     
this discussion I'm going to go back to this discussion we've had for this paper a lot so thank you for that oh yeah yeah     
2:22:41     
that's good good stuff all right um so yeah thanks for     
2:22:47     
attending and at that great conversation and let's follow up on this conversation in particular I this was really good     
2:22:54     
yeah yeah I just point out that um that um     
2:22:59     
pandus pandosy or whatever yeah yeah you know his his that U that     
2:23:08     
Chomsky paper that he did is still um still on the leaderboard at Ling buuz     
2:23:14     
yeah which is you know like the Linguistics yeah I mean it's still it's     
2:23:20     
still reverberating oh it's good yeah yeah I think there's some some really interesting things there in terms of um     
2:23:29     
um yeah just you know the discussions that have been um ongoing in linguistics     
2:23:36     
itself about the role of language and and yeah and it's Dev that I think would     
2:23:43     
be really interesting we I maybe I'll try to get that paper for next time     
2:23:49     
awes all right thanks have a good week take care take care by bye

## NOTES
Trevor ‚Äî> idea turned out as a dead-end. Sonogenetics (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9264), trigger neuronal modulation.

next month ‚Äî organic collaborations. Infrastructure for wet lab.

braingeneers.ucsc.edu ‚Äî BioE, developmental genomics, make lab automation.

make lab automation hardware, open-source.

UCSC innovation group ‚Äî all open-source.


$5k grant for infrastructure.

Braingeneers ‚Äî scalability in cultures, electrophysiology of organoids.

rat cells ‚Äî UCSC, Muotri, UCSD ‚Äî semi-automated protocol).

Madeline Lancaster ‚Äî network dynamics ‚Äî> change in oprganoids, multi-cellular dynamics.

Qs: change in information-theoretic complexity.


2018 paper ‚Äî Muotri, Voytek.

2019 paper ‚Äî Santa Barbara group


Electrophysiology‚Äî MEA ‚Äî measure local activity. Also Ca+ imaging. Grow on top of MEAs.

Sarrah: small things for GSoC.

use an LLM to create more issues. What if it creates garbage, duplicates issues?

implement a template, step-by-step.

first LLM call, create a non-conflicting issue.

combined to create the final issue.


Don‚Äôt need to ad human-in-the-loop. Code quality rating ‚Äî AutoCodeRover.

personalization part ‚Äî basic storyline.

Jesse ‚Äî good week, busy times.

general updates: things for JoPro.

brain organoids ‚Äî how do we make a more concrete project description.


Admin work/functional Project Mgmt:

activities in Boston? Which will bear fruit?


NYCWiC ‚Äî a few of the upstate cities are in the running.

mentoring projects ‚Äî mental health working group.


Neuromatch ‚Äî summer school, impact scholars (continuing projects).

progressive in how to make education accessible.

workshop ‚Äî focused research organizations (in between industry and academia).

Related to Specula technologies. What can you do without a lot of funding. 

RFP (informal STEM learning).

celsius, well-aligned with Orthogonal (formalize to be a partner).

Project Mgmt stuff will happen Spring 2025. Model Builder stuff will be coming up in the Fall of 2024.

Neuroacademy UWE science institute.

Flock to Fedora event. More to do here.


Along the lines of Neurorobotics:

route-finding, 2-D maze, virtual rat, SNN model.

makes Neuroscience an Engineering field. Engineering things that seem so fundamental to us.
Dynamic Causal Modeling ‚Äî relate to brain imaging ‚Äî brain networks.

world models ‚Äî secret sauce, tradeoffs in the RL machinery.

what does computational tractability mean in the context of the brain?

what was Sutton (RL) trying to accommodate with temporal differencing?


Alberta plan ‚Äî DeepMind Alberta. 

fine-tuning, understand the issues better.

reformulation of the problem.

Ryan Smith ‚Äî Active Inference (tradeoffs).

bottom-up neural models, higher-level task. In an RL context.


Build-a-Cell. Single-cell organism ‚Äî> real-time behavior action.

Romain Brette ‚Äî Paramecium, single-cell spatial cognition (navigation, taxis).

understanding HC without understanding evolutionary context.

bird migration (Jammer), hippocampus ‚Äî part of a larger network.

complexity used for  other cognitive tasks.


History of Dopamine: attach paper on RL aspects of reward.

not replicating what the brain is intrinsically doing.


Read Montague paper from 1997 ‚Äî relate a new model to Reinforcement Learning.

If you want to bring a bit of structure to the organoids project, or make some description of its aims, im happy to do that; been doing a lot of that work lately

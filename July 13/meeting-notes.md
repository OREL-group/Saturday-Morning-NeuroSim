## Notes
SMN -- July 13. 

Jesse -- attended a workshop on Polyvagal theory --> social work, psychology, regulation of oneself.

* phenomenology ties (cardio-, micro-).

* direct interactiosn with individuals.


Siloed spaces. Applied update: sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems.

* direct interactions with individuals.

* can phenomenology be --> sybjective, personal experience.

* DevAI -- child development. Polyvagal (are things regulated or not?)

* JoPro updates -- websit updates. Media lab --> conferderation of labs.

* effective altruism (EA) mentoring.


Three states, two macrostates. Overlaps with Varela -- navigating states.

* World Models I. 

* Sarrah's work and the Sims paper. Polyvagal theory could have a space here.

* Avery's ideas into the SIMSulator. how states change --> BVs and meta-brains (personality descriptions).

* Simulation of Interactions approach. 


Emile Torres reading group. Broad, big takes on the future (divergent opinions).

* NeuroAI -- two weeks of synthesis, interdisciplinary.

* career development mentor. Long-term aim --> space for history of science.

* pacing of paper for historical trends are good.


Why were there AI winters? "Practical neccessity rather than curiosity".

* what is practical vs. curiosity-driven? Related to static takes of AI. 

* Winter Histories (one possible lens).

* language for degree of formalization in a certain field? Maturity ~ formalized.


Children's mental models of recursive logo programs: https://telearn.hal.science/hal-00190537

Kurland, D.M. and Pea, R.D. (1985). Children's mental models of recursive logo programs. Educational Computing Research, 1(2), 235-243.

* recursion concepts (kids got the wrong idea on their own). Resilient to evidence and counterfactuals.

* let's find the reduced wrong form --> data analysis and mapping to a manifold.

* isn't it useful? Mathematical importance of differentiability (singularity).

* Scardapane, S. (2024). "Alice's Adventures in a Differentiable Wonderland -- Volume I, A Tour of the Land". arXiv, 2404.17625.

UC Berkeley: course on LLMs. "Why do children and adults learn differently"?

* continual vs. subset, discrete learning (multistep, multiphase process).

* do not need to get everything right at first pass -- redescription needed.

* Babies -- fast learners, Adults -- slow learners (a different version of fast and slow).

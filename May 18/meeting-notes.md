## NOTES:
Jes: CogFutures RG -- returns in mid-June. CybRG -- also on break.

DW -- cell-organismal modeling, different approaches.


JoPro -- reorganization, can dovetail with program, data analysis for project.

* Inclusive Gaming post -- forthcoming. Connections (WeRobot? VR people?).

* deep philosophical work. Epilepsy Fountation event.


EveOnline -- spreadsheets in space (https://www.eveonline.com/).

* lessons learned from VisiCalc. SimCity -- governments ignore good simulation work.

* winning strategies seem totalitarian.

* computational agents --> play video games. What is the superhuman strategy?


Centralized control master loop. Generate control from collective action. Allostatic discovery.

* Active Inference drone control software. Interface for agent-agent communication. 

* agent-environment interactions. "How to Grow Almost Anything" -- good gemonic manipulations (Benchling -- https://www.benchling.com/).

* basics for designing plasmids. TFAS -- transcranial-focused ultrasound.

* Chatbots and monetizing Psychiatry. Chatbots reinforce our biases, need to understand patient-therapist.

* too much anecdotal evidence -- where techniques is biased to do well. 

* Numbers, metrics. Interventions that do better than placebo, dealing with effect sizes, statistical noise.


Biobank --> see people before they are sick.

* foundation models for medicine --> Stability AI associated. Brain-inspired transformer models.

* longitudinal aspect of this --> who will develop a positive diagnosis.

* systems physiology -- is a lot more going on than we can track.


Emily Bender podcast -- automated lab platforms. 

* interpretability -- do humans need to be involved in matabolomic analysis.

* human oversight and interpretability. Database results (new tools) --> link them together.

* Neuromatch --> mentors and research collaborations. Research partnerships (neuromatch.io/partner/mentor).

Sarrah Bastawala says:
No major updates from my side apart from the blog I had presented yesterday that can be found at 
https://sarrah-basta.github.io/blogs
, in doing some research for frameworks to use for my project I found this 
https://pettingzoo.farama.org/tutorials/langchain/langchain/
 tutorial that I found interesting as it is trying to use Pettingzoo environments via Langchain agents powered by LLMs...

Also‚Ä¶. I found out brian eno knew cybernetics and conway game of life  . Edge article in slack

The fate of mant conpanies is still in ‚Äúmake a spreadsheet so we can see those numbers‚Äù smh

SpreadsheetCity probably wasnt as fun to market

Himanshu says:
Can you share link of this article? very interesting

Sarrah Bastawala
Sarrah Bastawala says:
This article reminds me of a project I had seen in Octave from : 
https://octave.discourse.group/t/control-libreoffice-calc-from-gnu-octave/2025
. Octave, which is an ipen source equivalent of Matlab, is used heavily for mathematical and scientific computations and simulations. This project was an attempt to connect it to Libreoffice Calc (kind if the open source equivalent to Excel), and kind if bring together yhe tabular formatting of data with the visualization capabilities 
Sarrah Bastawala says:
Open source equivalent of Matlab*

Himanshu
Himanshu says:
Robin Baumgarten's a* agent had won the mario AI compeition and is used in a lot of 2d game setting 
Himanshu says:
Sure!

Curiosly it also raises questions about what the human unspoken rules are and why  .

 discusses agent-agent vs agent-environment communication to quite a good degree

Paola Di Maio says:
hellow everyone a bit late and tired here, but I cannot find the neurotech channel on slack. am i just not seeing it? 
Paola Di Maio says:
or maybe it is the virtual-reality-neuroech channel I need to join 
10:19

Morgan Hough
Morgan Hough says:
No sorry. Its a different Slack 
Morgan Hough says:
NeuroTechX is a nonprofit I am a part of too

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
ah thanks 
Paola Di Maio says:
ok, thanks 
Paola Di Maio says:
I was pointed there before but had not yet gotten to it, will do  now 
Paola Di Maio says:
Thanks @morgan I am looking at the page on neuromatch, lets see if it leads anywhere interesting

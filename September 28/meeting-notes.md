## NOTES:
Big Brain Project/HIBALL conference.

* global EEG meeting. 


Meta: spending is bearing fruit.

* CTRL-Labs (pronounced control).

* Bergeron -- won a Kaggle BCI dataset performance.


CTRL Labs based in New York. MOABB paper, hired in person from group. NiLearn.

* SciKitLearn project -- reliability, accuracy from motor imagery.

* motor control in amputees -- still peripheral nerve-related EMG.

* gestural control -- deemphasizing movement. Hand can be still and you still get a usable signal.


Project Northstar people -- gestural computer vision. Stereo camera iPad attachment.

* photostitching a 3-D model. 

* 2019: Facebook had a brain imaging group.

* what was going on in company at that time. Ultimate UX/UI.


Demos that remain Demos -- a problem.

* PiEEG -- shield, attaches on top of a Pi. Open-source hardware.

* Brain Box initiative -- new Neuromodulation tech. Commercial arm makes tFAS systems (excitement in start-up world. SF, South Bay, LA).

* TMS systems and TES devices. 

* masterclass in Brain Imaging on YouTube.

* OHBM -- educational days. Eight presentations on cortical surface precision, imaging (whole-brain dynamics).


Receptor mapping. Big Brain started in brain slicing. Minimal Cell Workshop @ Ventner Institute (YouTube).

* 10um resolution, can see every cell. Traverse brain. Eulich -- German supercomputing.

* eBrains -- first generation of Big Brain good for computational Neuro people, now its Brain Imagers/fundamental researcher's turn.

* what is clinically relevant? Brain innovation. Global brain consortium (globalbrainconsortium.org).

* mind-brain clinic -- first 30 years of EEG.


Jesse: intrigued by Question Space, complexity theme --> complexity explorer.

* David Krakauer's work. Where is this relative to complexity in general?

* what is Bradly or Morgan's take on complexity? 

* teleonomic manner -- what is this? 


Vision: interesting. Sean Carroll, Mindscapes.

* teleology paper is very interesting. Different layers and tools. Developing theory and tools.

* what happened to Cybernetics? Cybernetics --> complexity pipeline, Cybernetics.

* computing science pipeline. NECSI, Complexity Hub.


Histograms are nice and neat. Tukey's Historical Data Exploration (1960s).

* new representations of the data (non-parametric, alternative to Pearson, Fisher).

* Tufte to UMAP --> what tests should you do to see if these models are appropriate.

* non-normality, homogeneity of variance.


Had to do averaging in 1960s, only thing that was algorithmically-computable.

* SVD-based approach, space-time-trails-subjects.

* visual system can bring out structure from plots.


ORAC --> organoid research and augmented computing (a.k.a. organoid intelligence). Where do biological models become relevant for computing?

* problems with ERPs --> beyond averaging -- single-time sturcture, joint time-frequency plots.

* event-related spectral perturbations. # of components for dimensionality reduction --> denoising, demixing.

* ability to get "work" done from biological systems is a far-off goal.

* which organisms are interesting to hijack for minimal cells?

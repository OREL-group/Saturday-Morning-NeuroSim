## TRANSCRIPT
0:02   
Good morning. Uh, welcome to our meeting. So, last week we didn't have a   
0:07   
meeting. We had an admin meeting instead and that was private. Uh, we discussed   
0:12   
some of the directions forward for what we'll be doing in the fall and in the next year coming up.   
0:20   
uh no hard and fast plans but we are planning on having at least one event   
0:27   
public event as well as participating in the active inference   
0:32   
symposium for this year which I'll talk about in a little bit.   
0:37   
So in terms of our meetings this week we had one DVAware meeting this is our GitHub archive of the DVOR   
0:44   
meetings. Uh since we didn't have a meeting last week, I'll talk about both last week's   
0:49   
meeting and or the week before's meeting and then last week's meeting. So the week before September one, I did a   
0:56   
summary of our activities. That was the day when all of the Google   
1:01   
Summer of Code projects were due. And so I gave a tour of all of both uh   
1:08   
DVORM or D.VO graph submissions for GOC.   
1:13   
So congratulations again to Giadrathagian and Lew with Baru for their work this   
1:18   
summer. They both did I think a very good job   
1:24   
and uh properly submitted their research and so we went over those repositories   
1:32   
and if you go to the meeting notes you'll see a link to the repository.   
1:38   
Then in addition to that I talked about this new paper that discusses a neurite based   
1:45   
developmental conneto. So in drya's project specifically he cites this data   
1:52   
set from from whitle at all I think it's from   
1:58   
2021 and they have this developmental conneto   
2:04   
with uh synapses specified. So you have the laral stage worm uh as it develops   
2:11   
through its different laral stages and they're able to track the synapses and the change in synapses over that time.   
2:19   
And so that's relevant to this new paper because this new paper proposes a   
2:24   
neurite based developmental conneto where neurites are the projections from   
2:31   
one cell to another. So they're able to actually track those. So instead of just having a conneto that   
2:38   
describes connections between cells, we actually have some of these new   
2:43   
details from laral development that talks about some of the things going on   
2:50   
in this rather lengthy stage of C elegance life history.   
2:55   
And so that was a very interesting paper. I'd go back to that meeting to check out like some of my comments on it   
3:01   
and and some of the details of the paper. So that was September one. Then last   
3:07   
week, September 8th or rather last Monday, we discussed a couple of papers on the   
3:13   
mathematical modeling of cell deformation and another paper on biotensgrity and   
3:19   
superstability. So Susan has this long-standing interest in working on tenserity models of the   
3:25   
cell and working out mathematical modeling of the cell mechanics in a cell   
3:31   
in a epithelial sheet or some other structure that you'll find in developing   
3:38   
embryos and she offered some papers that she run across and then that led into   
3:43   
our discussion on biotinity and superstability. Now that latter paper is really   
3:49   
interesting because it offers a lot of insight into sort of a a tensegrity   
3:55   
model for biology. And this is something that Susan has been having trouble finding because most people work on   
4:01   
tenseity structures. They work on things architecture or mechanical systems and   
4:08   
those aren't suitable for biological systems. This is a paper by some experts in the   
4:15   
area of biotensgrity. some big names such as it is and they   
4:21   
offer this model of biotensgrity as a fundamentally different set of   
4:27   
things than what you would find in a tensegrity structure. Nainly that there are these closed kinematic chains that   
4:35   
propagate forces throughout the structure making it super stable and unlike maybe like a mechanical   
4:43   
structure. So check that meeting out. That's a good meeting um especially for if you're   
4:48   
interested in that area. So the next thing I'm going to talk about is something that Morgan posted in   
4:55   
the Slack. This is an upcoming conference called Metagame. This is a   
5:01   
conference about game design, strategy, narrative, and play. This is being held   
5:08   
I guess this weekend in Berkeley. And so um I don't know what the details are   
5:14   
here. We'll look in a minute. But this is an interesting um event where they're looking at these   
5:21   
kind of different types of games like board games and card games, video games,   
5:27   
tabletop games, puzzles, rock climbing routes, that's interesting, and more.   
5:33   
And so it's basically answering the question, what would the consumer of this experience choose to do next? So   
5:40   
that's kind of what they're doing. And it seems like it's both a social event and a conference.   
5:47   
The speakers include um   
5:52   
not familiar with any of these names, but they're from various um companies and organizations that do   
6:00   
things in this space. So, thanks to Morgan for pointing that   
6:05   
out. There's also this Crowdcast event. Um,   
6:12   
this is something that happened this week, but you can watch the replay on Crowdcast. This was hosted by Worldwide   
6:18   
Neuro. We haven't talked about uh Crowdcast in a while, but you know,   
6:24   
there's still content being published on Crowdcast and this is a seminar that is going to   
6:31   
talk about the evolution of brain cell types. So we've talked about that in the meetings before and how to define those   
6:39   
and their relevance to cognition and neuroeolution. And so uh these are two   
6:45   
speakers here uh Maria Intoaneta toas who will be speaking on the evolution of   
6:51   
cahaletsia cells by cell type neofunctionalization. And the second speaker is Paul Katz cell types versus   
6:59   
cellular identities and nitrank mollisks. And so that looks like it's   
7:04   
it's quite interesting. They're 20 minute talks a piece. So check that out when you have a chance. Now I wanted to   
7:11   
talk a little bit about the fifth annual active inference symposium. So last year we participated in the   
7:18   
fourth symposium and we had a nice set of talks. Um I hosted a talk uh where I   
7:26   
interviewed Stefan Bulman who's involved in various uh open-source efforts in the   
7:31   
neuroscience analysis community and the neuroiming community. So he's interested in reproducible   
7:38   
research software and some of those initiatives   
7:44   
and the video where I interview him is on our YouTube channel but of course there's   
7:51   
another version that is part of the symposium that's on the active inference YouTube channel. We also talked about   
7:57   
open source and open access. I gave a a lecture on that and that is also available on both YouTube channels. um   
8:05   
and a lot of interesting points that I raised last year that I'm going to try to transfer to this year's set of   
8:12   
presentations and then Jesse of course gave a short presentation and that's also on our   
8:17   
YouTube channel on some project manager things. So for the fifth annual symposium which   
8:25   
is in uh coming up in November early to mid November I think it's like the 12th   
8:30   
through the 14th there it is and so this is free to attend this is virtual and we   
8:38   
have you know a couple of submissions already. I decided that we were going to   
8:43   
talk about spatial cognition and uh agents and uh cybernetic   
8:51   
regulation and things like that. This this um kind of arose from a discussion I had um with Adam Saffron about how   
9:01   
spatial cognition is really maybe the root of cognition in animals. And so,   
9:07   
you know, I'm going to talk about that a little bit. I don't know what that's going to look like yet exactly, but   
9:13   
we're working on that. I also wanted to give an update on the open source sustainability project. So,   
9:20   
this is the project that we've been working on over the last few summers with um different GOC scholars, but also   
9:28   
things that we're trying to do get off the ground with respect to our agent based modeling and our computational   
9:34   
agents work. So, you know, it' be a nice opportunity to kind of put that in a   
9:39   
larger context for people and see if we can get some additional interest in that   
9:44   
area. And we can still and I would like to interview someone from our opensource   
9:54   
uh reproducibility community. Um, you know, I don't know, we talked a little   
9:59   
bit in our admin meeting about possible names. We have possible names from last   
10:04   
year. So, we might follow up with another interview. We'll just have to schedule that interview and and see, you   
10:11   
know, how that shakes out. So, we have a plan going forward. We need to get some   
10:17   
things done between now and November at the time of the symposium. And if you're   
10:23   
interested in participating, let me know.   
10:29   
In terms of the symposium itself, we're not really there yet in terms of an agenda, but you know there uh you can   
10:36   
look at the symposia from past years. In 2021, it was largely like a Carl Fristen   
10:43   
exercise. In 2022, there was robotics theme. In 2023, it was enacting   
10:50   
ecosystems of shared intelligence. In 2024, the theme, I guess, was applied   
10:56   
active inference. And then this year's theme, I I don't know what the theme is this year actually.   
11:03   
I don't really think that there's a a theme that's been settled on, but in any case, it doesn't matter because people   
11:10   
uh anyone working in active inference or in a live field is invited to give a talk.   
11:17   
So, if you're interested in participating, there's the symposium link. Uh you can fill out a submission   
11:23   
form for submitting researchers. Um, you can also sponsor the symposium if you're   
11:29   
so inclined or you can register just simply as a participant. You can go onto   
11:35   
their YouTube channel and and join the live stream or you can go into the uh   
11:40   
Zoom. It's usually the live stream is better for casual participants.   
11:47   
This is another article that was posted in the Slack. Uh I think it may have been Jesse who posted this. Um but it's   
11:54   
it's really interesting with respect to reinforcement learning and so um it's   
11:59   
from decisions and dragons which I think is a blog online. Um and so they ask the   
12:06   
question and when you motivate something with a question the answer is always no.   
12:12   
Um so the question here is actually it's two questions in the title. Should we   
12:18   
abandon reinforcement learning or RL? And then is it the right approach? So   
12:25   
we're going to answer both of those questions here. So the answer for the   
12:31   
first question is no. We should not abandon reinforcement learning. I get it   
12:36   
though. Reinforcement learning algorithms are brittle, difficult to scale, and complicated.   
12:42   
However, this question is predicated on a misconception. Reinforcement learning is not an   
12:47   
approach. Reinforcement learning is a problem definition. So it's a different kind of maybe way of thinking about   
12:54   
reinforcement learning and reminding us that it's a problem definition more than a means to an end in terms of   
13:01   
learning. Reinforcement learning is the problem of determining how an agent should make   
13:08   
decisions in an unfamiliar environment. It must act to both learn about its   
13:13   
environment and pursue its objective. We must learn from its experiences rather   
13:18   
than human curated data sets. We don't abandon problems. They were   
13:23   
imposed upon us and we ignore them at our peril. Asking if a problem is quote unquote right isn't a coherent question.   
13:31   
What is a coherent question is whether a problem is important or relevant.   
13:36   
So I would also add to that whether the question is salient.   
13:42   
uh meaning that is it something that's within your view. So you might think something is important but if it's not   
13:48   
if that question is not in your view or a good form of that question is not in your view you can't really answer it.   
13:54   
Something might also be relevant which means it could be important but not relevant and and be ignored. So there   
14:01   
are all these different aspects of questions.   
14:06   
RL is an important problem. If you care about building systems that can act and learn in the world like people do, then   
14:13   
reinforcement learning, that problem is impossible to avoid. The question is not   
14:18   
whether we should abandon reinforcement learning, but how we can make better algorithms to solve it.   
14:26   
So this person cites the Sutton and Barto textbook   
14:32   
and this person thinks that RL is a problem rather than an approach   
14:38   
and that's not a controversial idea and as if we go into the Sutton and Barto   
14:44   
book in the first chapter they say reinforcement learning is   
14:49   
defined not by characterizing learning methods but by characterizing a learning problem. Any method that is well suited   
14:56   
to solving that problem, we consider to be a reinforcement learning method.   
15:02   
So if we hope to solve the reinforcement learning problem, we must not conflate it with common methods to solve it nor   
15:09   
with overly specific formalisms of it. Achieving success might depend on someone coming up with a unique   
15:15   
perspective that we haven't yet considered. So they point out that reinforcement   
15:22   
learning is not limited to model free methods. Um   
15:27   
so it isn't just limited to things like Q-learning and SARSA.   
15:33   
Uh while the reinforcement learning problem requires the agent to act without initially knowing how its   
15:38   
actions will affect the environment, there is nothing about the reinforcement learning problem itself that prevents   
15:45   
the agent from learning a world model and planning with it. In other words, model based reinforcement learning still   
15:53   
solves the RL problem. But of course model free reinforcement   
16:00   
learning there are good reasons why that has not been predominant.   
16:05   
So learning a useful world model turns out to be challenging and choosing the right kind of world   
16:11   
model training objective can be tricky. So, how do you optimize for feature   
16:18   
level accuracy? And you know, how do you make tradeoffs   
16:25   
when you do that? While sufficiently accurate feature   
16:30   
predictions will allow an agent to plan well, in practice, even small errors   
16:35   
tend to result in a poor model for planning. What we really want is an objective to   
16:40   
make good predictions of future rewards conditioned on different counterfactual   
16:46   
actions. We want something like a Q function loss that is estimated through   
16:51   
a world model. A practical implementation of course is harder than it sounds. There are al new newer newer   
16:58   
algorithms like dreamer v3 and mu0 that show that mbrl   
17:06   
is getting better. This is model based reinforcement learning and with the broader AI   
17:12   
community taking an interest in world models. There are people working on this problem   
17:17   
more people working on this problem than ever before. Myself and many others believe that   
17:23   
during modelbased reinforcement learning right may need may be the key to cracking the reinforcement learning   
17:29   
problem. So don't limit your approach to model free methods.   
17:38   
So one of the main methods used in reinforcement learning is generalized policy iteration.   
17:45   
In this method, the algorithm estimates the value function and uses it to improve its policy.   
17:51   
So Q-learning, SACE and PO are all GPI methods or generalized policy iteration   
17:57   
methods. Even model based approaches like dreamer v3 and mu0   
18:04   
have this generalized policy iteration sitting on top of a world model that's been learned by the model. Generalized   
18:11   
policy iteration is popular because it tends to yield the best results and it has various appealing properties.   
18:18   
However, just as the reinforcement learning problem does not restrict us to model free methods, it does not restrict   
18:24   
us to generalized policy iteration either.   
18:30   
So, you know, is this a dead end or not? Well, we don't really know, but you know, there may be other options.   
18:38   
So, there are a number of options that we could take for non GPI methods   
18:45   
which maybe include evolutionary algorithms. upside down reinforcement learning or   
18:51   
decision transformer styles. These are just methods that exist in the literature that you know might work   
18:57   
better than generalized policy iteration.   
19:03   
Um and then of course metalarning which is where the agent learns to learn.   
19:08   
You can apply almost any blackbox optimization method to a reinforcement learning problem because the blackbox   
19:14   
optimization problem is even more general than the reinforcement learning problem.   
19:21   
And then they point out that reinforcement learning is not limited to Markoff decision processes.   
19:27   
You may be excused for thinking that reinforcement learning is about solving Markoff decision processes, but it's   
19:32   
not. Not only are there non-markoff decision process reinforcement learning   
19:38   
formulations, most markoff decision processes fall in the category of planning rather than   
19:45   
reinforcement learning. And so they point to two examples   
19:51   
which are partially observed Markoff decision processes or palm DPS and   
19:57   
stochastic games. And both of these methods generalize markoff decision processes   
20:05   
where the agent must rely on a memory and take explicit information gathering actions even after it's familiar with   
20:11   
the environment. Stoastic games also include multiple agents acting on their own interests   
20:19   
that may or may not line with each other. And this is something that you can use   
20:26   
uh in various uh ways to augment reinforcement learning.   
20:33   
And there are other variants available. It's the ones that I mentioned are more   
20:38   
convenient in terms of their implementation, but you know there are other possibilities. So one of the other   
20:45   
problems with reinforcement learning as a as a a problem to be solved is that   
20:50   
it's somewhat vague. So, it's hard to really get a handle on   
20:55   
what is included in the reinforcement learning problem. But of course, it's no worse than anything else that we use for   
21:03   
learning such as supervising. Like reinforcement learning, supervised learning is a vague definition by   
21:09   
design. It allows for a bevy of formalizations and a creative variety of methods to solve it. You have basianism,   
21:16   
maximum likelihood, probably approximately correct optimization and so on.   
21:24   
There are even people attempting to apply dempster Schaefer theory which I think is interesting because that has   
21:31   
implications for belief structures and other things like that. Despite that, supervised learning remains useful   
21:37   
highle problem description and as the same is true for reinforcement learning. And what's   
21:43   
interesting is that people have made connections between reinforcement learning and control theory where people   
21:49   
have um sort of objected to reinforcement learning because they think where they feel that it's   
21:55   
reinventing control theory and indeed there's a lot of overlap in what you're doing. You're essentially building   
22:01   
things on feedback and you're building things on sort of optimization. So basically it has the   
22:09   
same structure as control theory. Um actually it's interesting is that cybernetic control also has that kind of   
22:16   
kind kind of structure and if you go to our uh uh recently minted archive paper   
22:22   
on the ever good regulator theorem we we raise some of these issues in that paper   
22:28   
and so you might ask why splinter from control theory   
22:33   
um but you know I mean maybe that it offers different types of benefits   
22:39   
uh maybe it needs to be unified into a general theory of control or a general theory of feedback. It's hard to say.   
22:47   
But while control theory work provides a mathematical foundation for reinforcement learning, the field for   
22:52   
the most part does not focus on the reinforcement learning problem. Control theorists are interested in engineering   
22:59   
and systems dynamics and figuring out control laws that they can write down and apply to an engineering system.   
23:08   
In reinforcement learning, however, the focus is on an agent that must learn   
23:14   
about the system and how to control it on its own through interaction. So there's this uh fundamental difference   
23:20   
there. So if we think about control theory being a a exercise in systems   
23:26   
identification, we find that systems identification often fits the parameters of a human   
23:32   
engineered physics model. Even when his model is a black box like a neural net, the data is used to train it. The data   
23:39   
used to train it is usually assumed to be provided up front. You don't have   
23:44   
this focus on acting, learning, and collecting data like you have a reinforcement learning.   
23:50   
And so there is this distinction with a difference. So that's enough about that article. I   
23:56   
think it's very enlightening in terms of some of the things we've been doing with reinforcement learning and some of the   
24:02   
things we've been exploring with cybernetics and the links to control theory and to partially observe Markoff   
24:09   
decision models and then by extension active inference. Now this is something that Morgan posted   
24:15   
on LinkedIn and we had a discussion about it online and I wanted to kind of   
24:21   
point this out. So this is a talk by Alexander Shaw from the University of   
24:27   
Exit and this is just kind of a preview where he talks about active inference a   
24:32   
neuroinspired blueprint for general intelligence. This kind of gets into the free energy principle and um intelligent   
24:40   
agents and all this. So it kind of goes over how active inference is related to   
24:48   
AGI. So why does active inference matter for AGI? And so he says any persist any   
24:54   
system that persists which means it continues for a long time. It continues despite perturbation.   
25:01   
It continues despite changes in the world must avoid disorganizing or what in in   
25:09   
active inference and in reergy principle we call surprising states.   
25:15   
Biological agents do this by building models of their world, inferring hidden causes of sensory data, and acting to   
25:22   
make future data match their predictions. So this is a definition of active   
25:28   
inference where there's this core decision objective which is governed by free energy   
25:34   
and agents acting upon that update beliefs to explain data that they gain   
25:40   
through perception and select policies to make data predictable which is their action and jointly minimize the expected   
25:47   
free energy of perception and action. So they use this expected free energy and   
25:53   
they minimize it as a as a product of the joint distribution.   
25:59   
And so why this matters for super intelligence as they define it in AGI.   
26:04   
It gives a unified objective. So one principle drives perception, learning, exploration and control.   
26:11   
There's built-in curiosity. So exploration emerges intrinsically. There's model based and embodied   
26:18   
aspects. So you have you learn a world model and use it for inference, planning and action. And it gives us a scalable   
26:26   
architecture that you can use.   
26:31   
And so it looks like they he did a study on Pong where they did some u work showing this   
26:39   
active inference agent interacting. And this this ties into a lot of things   
26:45   
we've been talking about with dish brain and um organoids and organoid   
26:51   
intelligence. So that's that's kind of where the application is. But also you   
26:56   
can look at computational agents and use a similar framework. So a couple of   
27:02   
papers from Alexander Shaw's website. Um this is the first paper a neuroins by   
27:11   
computational framework for AGI predictive coding active inference and   
27:17   
free energy minimization. So the abstract reads, this paper proposes that   
27:23   
foundational principles for theoretical neuroscience, we call predictive coding, a free energy   
27:29   
principle, and variational inference offer a biologically grounded framework   
27:35   
or artificial general intelligence or AGI. These approaches characterize the   
27:40   
brain as a hierarchical inference system that continuously updates beliefs and   
27:45   
selects actions to minimize uncertainty and surprise. In contrast to conventional AI systems   
27:52   
which typically rely on static architectures and offline training, biological agents and gain an active   
27:58   
engage in active generative inference within dynamic uncertain environments.   
28:04   
We argue it is this inference-based architecture not just behavioral outputs   
28:09   
that underpins the adaptability, generalization and resilience of natural intelligence. And so they outline a   
28:16   
neuro inpired framework for this uh using variational lelass and active   
28:22   
inference. Finally, we contrast this approach with dominant deep learning paradigms and   
28:28   
discuss its implications for building interpretable, adaptive, and autonomous machine intelligence.   
28:35   
So they kind of walk through some of the background um and they come you know they they kind   
28:42   
of focus on predictive coding and the free energy principle is sort of the basis for this   
28:50   
um building a predictive loop that supports both epistemic behavior and instrumental behavior. So epistemic   
28:57   
behavior is where you reduce uncertainty through exploration and instrumental behavior is where you   
29:03   
pursue pursue preferred outcomes.   
29:10   
And this predictive loop is achieved internally by simulating possible features and evaluating them according   
29:16   
to expected free energy.   
29:23   
Variational free energy is defined by this equation which is an approx where where you get   
29:30   
basically have the KL divergence minus the log value of model evidence   
29:38   
and we can look to the brain as a model of general intelligence and you know use this model which models   
29:45   
what's going on in the brain as a biologically inspired approach to super   
29:51   
intelligence to AGI that.   
29:57   
So this is the second article, predictive coding in neurocomputational   
30:02   
psychiatry, a mechanistic framework for understanding mental disorders. And so   
30:07   
you know we're interested in computational psychiatry in this group. So I wanted to talk about that a little   
30:12   
bit. Um   
30:17   
the abstract reads, "Predictive coding offers a powerful computational framework for understanding brain   
30:24   
function and psychiatric disorders at a mechanistic level." This perspective   
30:29   
synthesizes advances in computational psychiatry, proposing that mental disorders can be conceptualized to   
30:36   
specific alterations in the brain's predictive inference machine.   
30:41   
We first outlined the theoretical foundations of predictive coding including basian inference for energy   
30:47   
minimization and neural population dynamics showing how these abstract computational principles that bond to   
30:54   
specific neural circuits and biohysical mechanisms. We then demonstrate how diverse   
31:00   
psychiatric conditions can be understood within this unified framework. Critically, this additionally provides a   
31:07   
basis upon which predictive coding becomes a testable, modifiable, falsifiable construct within biological   
31:15   
psychiatry. And so then it has clinical applications.   
31:21   
And by grounding psychiatric symptoms in aberant predictive processes implemented in neurosircuitry, this approach   
31:28   
promises a more mechanistic understanding of mental disorders and a path of more targeted effective   
31:34   
interventions. And so computational psychiatry is   
31:39   
defined here offers a new paradigm by integrating mathematical models with   
31:45   
neurobiology and explaining psychiatric phenomena in terms of aberant brain computations. So   
31:51   
computations that deviate from normal computations as defined experimentally.   
31:56   
And so how do we get these brain uh computations? Well, we use something like predictive   
32:02   
coding which allows us to derive sort of a normal course of learning   
32:09   
and then look at how there's sort of variation in that through variational methods.   
32:16   
This framework provides a normative or basian account of perception of an action where the brain tries to minimize   
32:22   
surprise or free energy. So this free energy has this surprisal factor which   
32:28   
is roughly the same as information entropy and information theory um by aligning its internal model with the   
32:34   
outside world. And so this is again what we do in closed loop cybernetics where we're looking at matching between the   
32:43   
model and the world. Crucially this perspective offers a plausible account of neuronal   
32:49   
computations and cortical circuits. Hierarchical networks of neurons are thought to exchange top- down   
32:54   
predictions and bottom up prediction errors to achieve in efficient information processing.   
33:04   
And so he goes on to kind of review um computational   
33:10   
psychiatry and showing kind of these different mechanisms here.   
33:17   
And then he walks through the math of predictive coding, uh, basian dynamics,   
33:24   
and then some other things having to do with neuroiming   
33:30   
and, uh, then coming up with a biohysical generative model, which kind of touches   
33:37   
on Hutchkin, Huxley, and finally coming up with a neuronal   
33:43   
circuitry of predictive coding where you can look at   
33:49   
um these hierarchical predictive coding models where every cortical area or layer of neoortex as units that encode   
33:56   
the current prediction of some features and units that encode the prediction   
34:02   
error or the unexplained residual. So the error is the residual. The prediction, the main prediction is   
34:08   
supposed to be the main thing that the model operates on.   
34:14   
Psychologically or physiologically, a plausible mapping is that deep layer paramidal neurons carry top down   
34:21   
predictions to lower areas while superficial layer paramidal neurons carry forward prediction areas to higher   
34:28   
areas. So he gets into a number of examples from psychiatry. The first is   
34:34   
obsessivecompulsive disorder which is an overactive error signal and precision problem.   
34:41   
So you basically have this uh differential equation that describes   
34:48   
obsessivecompulsive disorder. You have anxiety disorders which are defined as exaggerated uncertainty and   
34:55   
threat predictions. we have this uh evolution equation that   
35:01   
describes that and then bipolar disorder or the instability of precision and   
35:07   
network dynamics which is again this couple differential equation by in this case using different things   
35:15   
as inputs into it. So the idea is we create these mathematical models, these computational models. We investigate the   
35:22   
phenomena so we can get the data to input serve as inputs to those equations and we can maybe perhaps predict   
35:29   
different clinical states as functions of the brain as well as use these models like predictive processing and   
35:36   
predictive coding to yield insights into the circuitry.   
35:42   
So I wanted to go over this uh blog post. Um this is by Amari Diaz and this   
35:50   
is this person is otherwise known as complexity cat. So complexity cat is on   
35:55   
sky and and other platforms and they   
36:01   
posted this uh post on computing especially with respect to what does   
36:07   
computing mean. So this is kind of something we've revisited when we talked   
36:14   
about physical computation and when people talk about computers and   
36:19   
the brain or computers and biology or computation and biology usually people   
36:25   
are talking about um you know computational processes in biology or the brain and they use the term   
36:33   
computing and then that's allowed for there to be this   
36:39   
largecale debate about whether the brain or biology actually computes and I'm not   
36:46   
sure that a lot of people use the terms and tend there to be this huge uh debate   
36:51   
but you know when you don't have a precise definition of what you're what   
36:56   
you mean by computation or computing this is what tends to happen. Now the   
37:02   
reason why it's controversial is because there is actually a very rigorous definition of computation or computing.   
37:09   
The problem is it's not necessarily applicable to biology or the brain. So   
37:16   
you know we the one definition that we sort of agreed upon is the church   
37:21   
turning thesis or the church turning George Deutsch thesis uh which have a specific definition and   
37:30   
you know when you say computing usually people you know mean some computational   
37:38   
you know operation where you're adding things or multiplying things or subtracting things or comparing things   
37:46   
and those are not you know those are maybe not what we think of when we think   
37:52   
of computers or modern computers. So I think that the way it operates in   
37:59   
practice is a little bit divorced from the more formal definitions.   
38:04   
So that's why I found this essay so interesting because it gives this perspective on this and allows us to   
38:12   
kind of think uh beyond maybe the pancutationalist   
38:17   
approach that we've kind of settled on with respect to you know the way we   
38:24   
think of applying computation of biology in the brain and other natural systems.   
38:32   
So uh this starts the concept of computation as we now understand it as   
38:38   
deep historical roots originally tied to the human act of calculation.   
38:44   
Its meaning is expanded alongside developments in mathematics, logic and engineering. Early mechanical devices   
38:51   
such as Pascal's calculator or Babage's analytical engine embodied a physical   
38:56   
form of computation. But it was early in the 20th century the notion became rigorously formalized   
39:03   
and that definition is a well-defined transformation of symbols into symbols   
39:09   
or into other symbols attached from matter, time and energy. This is   
39:15   
you know just I guess this is consistent with the church turning thesis um or at   
39:21   
least a lot of the modern computing applications that we've built. We built computers.   
39:28   
Computers just don't come out of the sky. They're not natural things. We have to build those things, but we have to   
39:33   
build it based on an idea of what we want to produce with them.   
39:39   
Um, this abstract framing is reflected in standard references that define   
39:44   
computation in terms of algorithms, models of computation, classes of   
39:49   
solvable problems. So these again are sort of the fruits of computation or at   
39:54   
least the languages of computation. And so when you do something like computational biology, you know, if   
40:02   
you're saying that the cell computes something, you have to propose a natural   
40:08   
algorithm, you have to propose a natural model of computation, and you have to   
40:14   
have classes of solvable problems. And we're kind of moving in that direction with synthetic biology with some of the   
40:22   
there there have been books written some decades old that have proposed natural algorithms for things like uh gene   
40:29   
expression and other types of processes in the cell. But this is not, you know,   
40:35   
this is just kind of our interpretation of what's going on. It doesn't mean that that's something we can actively go in   
40:41   
and hack. Although you know we've we have some systems in the cell which you   
40:47   
can actually that are I would argue habitable.   
40:55   
Um so this is one I mean this is a nice rigorous definition of computing but of course it's you know kind of a one   
41:04   
definition of computing and there are other definitions. Uh we talked uh several weeks ago about uh sort of a   
41:12   
neurological touring test or a neurotringing test where you turning   
41:17   
test for behavior and the outputs of the brain and that was interesting because   
41:23   
it it bore some sort of resemblance to the work of Ellen Turing but it wasn't   
41:31   
exactly what Turing had in mind when he talked about a test of computation. So,   
41:37   
so moving on. Um, at the same time, contemporary debates ask whether such a   
41:42   
disembodied view is enough, especially once we notice how often the concept of computation migrates across domains from   
41:50   
silicon circuits to living cells to chemical reaction networks, giving rise   
41:56   
to this term can computationalism, which is a term that encompasses this   
42:02   
idea that computation is at the root of all natural systems. So a lot of times   
42:08   
actually the person who proposed panc computationalism um was uh   
42:16   
it was proposed by Fredkin and Fredkin was a physicist who basically argued   
42:22   
that all of nature essentially was computational or at least all of physics is computational and then that extends   
42:29   
to all of nature. So you know this is kind of framing this   
42:35   
um in this historical framework and of course now Alan Turing is discussed in   
42:42   
this article working within a scientific culture enthralled with mechanization and reduction. TR gave a canonical   
42:49   
analysis of effective procedures by his abstract machines and these are machines   
42:56   
that he designed that kind of uh allow a lot of computation to happen artificial   
43:03   
computation as Sydney Brener pointed out in life's codec script Turing's work became a huge   
43:09   
influence from logic to morphogenesis underlying how a mechanistic picture of symbol manipulation   
43:16   
became a lens for the life of sciences as well. Less wellknown outside specialist circles is how closely Lwick   
43:23   
Wittenstein uh tracked these developments over the 20th century's most significant   
43:28   
philosophers of logic, mathematics, mind and language. Witkinstein   
43:33   
not only was not only contemporaries of Turing at Cambridge, he also responded pointedly the philosophical reading   
43:41   
turning attached to his mathematical results. So uh this article here is um a nice   
43:50   
article that kind of summarizes this Wikipinstein versus Turing on the nature of church's thesis and this is kind of a   
43:58   
dis sort of a dialogue between Wickkinstein   
44:03   
and that Wikipin knew of Turing's work and engaged in its implications for the   
44:09   
very uh meaning of effective calculation. So underlying computation is this idea of effective calculation.   
44:18   
Uh it's it's kind of an interesting way to summarize what's going on and it's a   
44:24   
way to link the philosophy with the actual sort of mechanisms of   
44:30   
computation. This is a conversation that continues to unsettle how we answer the question this   
44:36   
essay title poses, which is what does computing mean? Um the author of this article um is   
44:45   
reminded of Robert Rosen's insights on computability and realizability.   
44:51   
And so you know this is something that is there's a connection between Rosen's work and this uh debate or I guess this   
44:59   
dialogue between Wikinstein and Tur. So you have Wikinstein, Turing and Rosen   
45:04   
kind of all contributing to this kind of view.   
45:11   
So the whole point of this article isn't just to kind of introduce this   
45:16   
problem although you know it's it's you could write a lot on that and we've we did a couple of meetings I think in 2023   
45:26   
uh where we talked about physical computation and then kind of moved from   
45:32   
that concept to sort of the application of computability to biology and you know   
45:40   
hit upon a lot of these issues. Um, but what this author is trying to do   
45:48   
here is trying to find the major epistemological gaps surrounding the concept of computation. A lot of times   
45:55   
people haven't addressed these directly. And so, like I said previously, you know, sometimes people take this   
46:02   
metaphor and they apply it and they don't think about it critically.   
46:07   
So there are a lot of things that are maybe actually supportive of the notion   
46:12   
of biology being computational that people aren't engaging with. They're just simply engaging with the metaphor.   
46:20   
And so then that means that the work suffers from this sort of um   
46:25   
interpretation that biology is like a modern computer that it's like a von   
46:30   
computer that it has like a very specific type of sort of set of   
46:36   
mechanisms and architecture that life simply doesn't have although life might still yet be computational.   
46:46   
So this discussion of what computation is of course has to go back to touring machines since that's our modern   
46:53   
definition of digital computing. And uh touring machines are idealized   
46:58   
devices that read and write symbols on an unbounded tape according to finitely   
47:04   
many rules.   
47:17   
As an abstract analysis of calculation, this framework has been enormously successful. Yet, as Shanker emphasizes,   
47:25   
Wikinstein's scattered remarks force us to return 1936 achievement with more   
47:31   
care. Um, so Wikinstein knew of Turing's uncomputable numbers work, but he left a   
47:39   
puzzling gloss in his remarks on the philosophy of psychology, Turing's machines.   
47:47   
So according to Wikinstein, Turing's machines um are these are machines are humans who   
47:55   
calculate. He then downplays the specialness of the halting problem. Trinian is no more   
48:01   
philosophically momentous than familiar paradoxes in the foundation of mathematics.   
48:07   
Um the author of this dialogue between Wikipenstein and Turring takes this   
48:13   
puzzling note as a point of entry. So it directs us to separate Turing separate   
48:19   
Turing strict mathematics from the metaphysical freight that later came to be carried under its banner.   
48:35   
So Wickinstein was thinking about this earlier than Turing but also then was in   
48:41   
the position to sort of critique what Turing was doing and have this dialogue. So if we go back to the 1930s which was   
48:48   
before Turring's work on the touring machine uh Wikinstein   
48:54   
had framed um a specific question which was can a machine think   
49:00   
and so that question is a category error until we clarify some of our concepts   
49:06   
because we have to say what thinking means and what a machine does to think.   
49:12   
So um this is interesting because uh Wikipinstein also made this   
49:18   
comparison uh by asking if number three has a color. And so the number three doesn't   
49:25   
have a color unless you specify what the number three is. If it's a shape and   
49:30   
then it can have that shape can have a color. So this is kind of a you know you   
49:36   
have to specify things more clearly. Second, the mechanist thesis itself was   
49:41   
in the air well before Turing's technical work. Wikinstein's contemporaneous remarks showed him   
49:48   
probing the grammar of thinking and pain. So Wikinstein used a lot of uh   
49:53   
human metaphors of human behavior, human emotion and so forth.   
49:59   
Um this these point uh these points explain why for Rickenstein Turing's   
50:05   
1936 paper looked like a hybrid mathematical logic on one side   
50:11   
philosophy of mind on the other and why he focused his criticisms on Turing's pros interpretation rather than the   
50:18   
formal results. So if we just read uncomputable numbers which was Turing's   
50:25   
landmark 1936 paper as a piece of mathematics   
50:30   
we find that once a class of functions is effectively representable say in some sort of binary form one can give an   
50:37   
abstract recipe for a device whose symbolic operations will compute those representations.   
50:44   
The main point is not that a machine thinks, understands or intends as it executes the rules, but that there   
50:52   
exists a finite determinate specification. His iterations produce the right   
50:57   
results. So, um, Turing doesn't use a lot of cognitive   
51:03   
terminology and maybe that's to his benefit. uh nevertheless his analysis illuminates   
51:10   
the link between recursion theoretic definitions and mechanical executability.   
51:16   
So Rosen uh Robert Rosen u kind of takes   
51:21   
picks up the mantle much later and kind of builds upon what Wickenstein talked about in some of his work independent of   
51:30   
Turring and then in his responses to Turing. Rosen kind of gives a caution here and   
51:37   
that is if we treat Church's thesis as a bridge from the mathematical notation of recursiveness   
51:44   
the physical notation of realizability we must add physics back in so if we are   
51:51   
explicit about the physical nature of it we have to bring physics back into the mix   
51:56   
as Rosen argued in church's thesis and its relation to the concept of realizability   
52:02   
and biology and physics which is this article here. Um, this is   
52:10   
from 1962 and this kind of goes over this argument   
52:16   
that an attempt to characterize the physical realizability of an abstract mapping process in terms of the turning   
52:23   
computability of an associated numerical function is described. Such an approach   
52:28   
rests heavily on the validity of Church's thesis for physical systems capable of computing numerical   
52:34   
functions. This means in effect that one must investigate in what manner Church's thesis can be converted into an   
52:41   
assertion concerning the non-existence of a certain class of physical process   
52:47   
which is where some process can calculate the values of numerical functions which are not turn computable.   
52:55   
And so this is basically taking the idea of computation kind of moving away from the church   
53:02   
turning thesis and kind of thinking about this as a separate thing. So in   
53:08   
this paper um Rosen argues that the slogan effectively calculable equals   
53:14   
recursive which is a term that was kind of extracted from this idea of effective   
53:20   
computation has no physical content on its face and to use it as a criterion of realiz real   
53:28   
realizability requires restating it as a claim about which classes of physical   
53:33   
process exist. Um as Rosen showed, this is only true given strong assumptions about the laws   
53:40   
that govern physical state change. In other words, without such assumptions,   
53:46   
um church touring is a convention in recursion theory that it becomes a   
53:52   
substantive empirical proposition vulnerable to how nature actually behaves.   
53:58   
So this is kind of like what what Rosen's trying to set up here is Rosen's trying to make this link between nature   
54:04   
and computation but kind of getting around the church turn thesis and that   
54:10   
rigorous definition of uh computation but also saying that   
54:17   
there is this actual model of computation we can use that's much simpler and but we have to bring physics   
54:24   
back into the mix to really understand what's going   
54:29   
uh Wickinstein's distinctive pressure point however is not physics but normativity   
54:35   
and so normativity is the phenomena in human societies of   
54:40   
designing such actions or outcomes as good desirable or permissible and others   
54:46   
as bad undesirable impermissible. So it's basically um   
54:54   
not necessarily this sort of uh objective physics but the subjective   
54:59   
normativity to describe a process with a rule is not yet to show that the process follows the   
55:06   
rule. Regularity is one thing rule following another. So if you think about, you   
55:13   
know, you say, well, we want to introduce physics back into the mix and then we think about sort of the   
55:20   
regularities that we expect from physics, you know, how do we know that those are actual regularities   
55:26   
and how do we know it's just not rule following that we defined by our previous definitions or cultural biases?   
55:34   
I guess that's what he's getting at here. The grammar of calculation ties it to   
55:39   
the ability to instruct, justify, correct or explain by reference to the   
55:45   
rule. So merely producing the right answers did not suffice to the to be calculating   
55:52   
in the sense that it belongs to mathematical practice. So you know but again when we do a   
56:00   
computation where we say something computes is it like something that computes   
56:08   
to sort of our expectations using sort of the human language of mathematics or   
56:15   
does it actually represent some sort of regularity in nature? I guess that's   
56:20   
what he's getting at here. it it's very, you know, it gets very abstract and subtle at this point. Um, but   
56:28   
it's it's definitely worth thinking about and definitely bringing Rosen's work into the mix is something I hadn't   
56:35   
thought about before. So, and then of course, you know, there's more here on   
56:41   
kind of thinking about computation as sort of a new and and thinking about how   
56:48   
maybe computation can be applied to biology or nature more generally in ways   
56:53   
that aren't sort of pancutational.   
56:58   
Um so Melanie Mitchell in her book the   
57:03   
metaphors of artificial intelligence says that much of what we say when we   
57:09   
say that machines learn understand or reason is merely a metaphor. Sometimes   
57:15   
you know we think about machines that learn or understand or reason and we try to draw analogies from that human   
57:21   
process or the biological process of learning understanding and reasoning.   
57:27   
But those are all metaphors and we can't confuse the metaphor for the actual thing. And so you know we might have a   
57:33   
something that resembles learning but mechanistically it's not learning. And   
57:39   
so the question then is are the mechanisms of say a neural network the same as the mechanisms of the brain? And   
57:46   
if not, are they close enough to just be the same thing or are we just making   
57:52   
this metaphorical assertion and there may be important differences between those two types of   
57:57   
learning. Um, so that's that's really what the sort of what a lot of the previous   
58:04   
section boils down to as well. um Shanker's Wick and Stenian reading   
58:11   
gives us the sharper edge which is if learning is any change that stably   
58:17   
improves performance then nothing categorically distinguishes biological learners from ideal learning machines.   
58:24   
So this is where we might have this category of ideal learning machine and   
58:29   
we might compare that with both biological learning and artificial learning and say you know how what what   
58:37   
properties do they share and then there's this idealized form of learning that we can then use as the as the   
58:43   
benchmark or the reference point. So that's an interesting take. Um   
58:48   
Shanker of course is the author of that paper where we talked about the dialogue   
58:54   
between Wikinstein and Turing. Um but however what becomes a rule   
59:01   
following are we committed to a picture in which an algorithm is just a set of trivial subruules whose blind execution   
59:07   
yields the right outputs. So you know are we just implementing rules that kind of give us the right   
59:14   
outputs? Like in other words, if we take a bunch of biological data and we impose our sort of rules of logic   
59:23   
onto them or we impose a bunch of mathematical operations onto it, we can   
59:30   
in theory get like the right outputs that give us an answer. So, it's kind of   
59:35   
like the Chinese earn problem where you pass a bunch of symbols into a a black   
59:40   
box and you get intelligible symbols out or intelligible or um orders of symbols.   
59:48   
But there was no process in there that was cognitive that actually sorted those symbols into something that was   
59:54   
intelligible. It was largely by chance or largely by constraint. And so the   
1:00:01   
same holds with rules. If we use rule-l like systems to interpret a bunch of   
1:00:08   
biological data and those data happen to satisfy the rules then we have this   
1:00:15   
you know this computation that nature did but all in fact we did was just apply our norm our norms our rules that   
1:00:23   
we got an output and we don't exactly know why or it doesn't necessarily have any   
1:00:30   
larger meaning than conforming to the rules we give   
1:00:35   
So, uh, Turing had a proposal about learning programs more generally from   
1:00:40   
his work on um computation that suggests a way machines can behave   
1:00:47   
intelligently without grasping meanings. Instructions must be complete and   
1:00:53   
explicit. The device need not understand in intermediate results and selfm   
1:00:59   
modification can increase competence by reorganizing its store of rules.   
1:01:05   
This neatly skirts the symbol grounding problem which is where uh you know we   
1:01:12   
have this old problem in cognitive science and in AI where you're basically   
1:01:18   
connecting symbols to real world objects and using that as sort of a ground truth. So symbols don't mean anything   
1:01:26   
until they're connected to something in the world. And we have to kind of figure out how a cognitive system does that in   
1:01:34   
order to understand, you know, to to order to say whether it understands   
1:01:39   
what's going on. So this is, you know, an old problem that people have been   
1:01:44   
talking about for decades, but what we're talking about here is something that kind of gets around it by   
1:01:50   
replacing understanding with execution plus revision. And so in in in a sense you can have   
1:01:57   
competence without semantics. So this is just kind of talking about more about rules and about following   
1:02:05   
rules as opposed to actually doing computations and engaging in in some   
1:02:10   
sort of model of understanding of the symbols that are presented to the system.   
1:02:19   
Okay. So let's go to the conclusion. Um, and so we still ask the question, what   
1:02:26   
does computing mean? Is it this narrow definition of the Turan church thesis?   
1:02:33   
Is it this discussion between Tur and Wickenstein? Is it something else that we haven't   
1:02:38   
really considered? And you know, will we actually be able to use computing or computation as more   
1:02:46   
than a metaphor? So turns analysis gives us a crystalline   
1:02:52   
mathematical notation which is effective procedures realized by a simple symbol   
1:02:58   
manipulation machine. So we have these procedures we have this well first of   
1:03:04   
all we have this symbol manipulator. It can turn one set of symbols into   
1:03:10   
another or it can turn some things in the environment into symbols. So symbols   
1:03:16   
are key. Um and but we we have to have this process of transformation.   
1:03:23   
And so we have to have these procedures that are regular. And so that's kind of what we could mean   
1:03:30   
by computation. We can mean it's a it's a it's a transformational system that   
1:03:35   
takes objects in the environment, turns them into symbols or turns some you know   
1:03:42   
one set of symbols into another set of symbols. So if we think about what happens inside   
1:03:47   
the cell, something like translation is might be a good example of that.   
1:03:53   
We have RNA which is composed of uh   
1:03:59   
the base pairs or the the bases of an RNA molecule   
1:04:05   
and that gets transformed into codons um by tRNA and there's this uh very uh   
1:04:14   
complex system where the RNA enters the mRNA enters the ribosome   
1:04:21   
it gets translated into a set of   
1:04:28   
amino acids and then it's uh turned into proteins.   
1:05:07   
So if we think about and so this um this biological machine is able to take   
1:05:14   
symbols and turn them into other symbols. You can also have   
1:05:20   
uh the expression of genes that are turned on. So it can turn a stimulus   
1:05:27   
into a symbol. There are a lot of options here and you know by this definition we could kind of make this   
1:05:33   
case that there's the set of effective procedures that are doing computation in the cell. But of course, that's still   
1:05:41   
kind of a metaphor because all we're saying is that there's a biological process and then we're just attaching   
1:05:47   
the name computation to it. Um, so you know, just thinking about   
1:05:54   
this, we can also go back to Rosen who adds a caution. If we treat church's   
1:06:00   
thesis as a physical claim about realizability, we must reformulate it in explicitly   
1:06:06   
physical terms um about which processes do not exist and then defend the strong conditions it   
1:06:12   
assumes about natural law and you know otherwise we mistake a   
1:06:18   
logical grammatical clarification for a statement about the world. So at the formal level, church turn   
1:06:25   
unifies our models of effective procedures and at the conceptual level the meaning of computing depends on the   
1:06:32   
role rules play in our practices and that dependence cannot be read off from   
1:06:37   
causal and causal structure alone. So this is kind of the summary that we   
1:06:43   
get from Rosen um basically that we have to think about   
1:06:49   
these procedures in a formal way. Is it computation or is it just some you know   
1:06:55   
action that doesn't do what we would classify as computation?   
1:07:01   
And then of course you know we have to kind of think about rules and how our   
1:07:07   
rules of say our mathematical language kind of conform to that.   
1:07:14   
So basically um you know I I don't know maybe there's a lot of kind of thinking   
1:07:22   
beyond the the core problem here. I don't think it is but it one could make that argument.   
1:07:28   
Um but where does this leave us? So first that suggests humility about computationalism and minded life. And by   
1:07:35   
that I guess the author is referring to a lot of the attempts to sort of um map   
1:07:42   
machine consciousness from like a metaphor. Like you know you   
1:07:47   
say life does computation or the brain does computation and you know the brain   
1:07:53   
is you know we have consciousness in the brain and we have you know uh lifelike   
1:07:59   
processes therefore we can replicate those in a machine and get similar   
1:08:05   
results and you know it's not anywhere near that simple but that's sort of the idea that we want to kind of move away   
1:08:11   
from. Turing's machines show what can be simulated by mechanical procedures, not   
1:08:17   
what counts as rule following in the full-blooded normative sense. Wikinstein emphasized.   
1:08:22   
Second, it supports a substrate tenant program. If we want computation to eliminate life or cognition, we should   
1:08:30   
investigate how particular substrates which are biological or chemical or some   
1:08:35   
other um maybe molecular substrate sustains the pragmatics of rule governed   
1:08:42   
activity rather than assume that symbol crunching is enough. Finally, it   
1:08:47   
reframes church touring as a hinge, mathematically indispensable, but philosophically non-final. To keep   
1:08:55   
meaning in view, we must, as Wickensstein urged, go right down to the foundations, not to replace Turing, but   
1:09:01   
to understand what his great inventions do, and crucially what they do not do by   
1:09:07   
itself decide. So this is uh kind of touching on the   
1:09:14   
decidability criterion of church turn. And so you   
1:09:19   
know a lot of that is um kind of embedded in   
1:09:25   
kind of the way we think about you know things like teology and decision making.   
1:09:31   
And we're, you know, we don't want to ascribe something to any system, whether it be a   
1:09:38   
computational system or a biological system.   
1:09:43   
Okay. So, that was that article. That was a nice article I think for   
1:09:49   
um you know I think it was a nice tour of sort of the philosophy around that   
1:09:54   
issue and some it brings up more questions and answers in a lot of ways   
1:09:59   
but it's you know it's it gets to a nice point I think.   
1:10:06   
Yeah. Um, hi. And I I just came in at the very end and I   
1:10:13   
I if you don't I feel uh very uh selfish   
1:10:19   
asking this question, but is there any way you could like summarize the article that was there cuz I just saw the end of   
1:10:25   
it. Um I was like, "Yeah, that looks really interesting." So I don't want to make you go back and do everything, but   
1:10:30   
I don't either. It deserves a summary. Um yeah. So this is   
1:10:37   
what does computing mean. This is uh from complexity cat. Um and uh the   
1:10:46   
author is Amahari Diaz. And uh this is basically an essay about the major   
1:10:53   
epistemological gaps surrounding the concept of computation   
1:10:58   
that have been sort of ignored in this debate uh about how you can apply the   
1:11:06   
idea of computation to life. So like biology or the brain. So we talked about   
1:11:12   
this back when we talked about physical computation. We've also talked about this in terms of   
1:11:17   
applying the metaphor of computation. And so one of the things in this article is that you know we have this metaphor   
1:11:25   
and the metaphor is you know has some power but it doesn't   
1:11:31   
have the power to sort of instantiate itself. In other words, you can't just,   
1:11:36   
you know, conjure up this formal computational set of rules and say that   
1:11:42   
life follows this computational set of rules and therefore we can understand it as computation and we can replicate it   
1:11:48   
in a computer when you know it it may not be computation that you're looking   
1:11:55   
at. it's just rule following or it's just sort of a regularity that nature is   
1:12:01   
um producing and you're interpreting it as in in the context of our ascribed   
1:12:08   
rules to it. So, you know, the the power of metaphor only goes so far. And the   
1:12:14   
whole point of that article was to point out that there are a lot of if we go back to um some debates back in the 30s   
1:12:21   
and 40s and even 60s people were thinking about this and it hasn't it's   
1:12:27   
kind of that debate has kind of been subsumed by people just applying the idea of comput or assuming the idea of   
1:12:34   
panc computationalism which is this idea that computation exists in nature and in machines and   
1:12:41   
they're just sort of the same definition and we could make a clean transition between the two.   
1:12:49   
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And I don't know this is in relation to   
1:12:54   
things I posted in coation features or not that it came up, but it does definitely fit   
1:12:59   
um some stuff that I've been exposed to this week. Uh and I have   
1:13:06   
Was that just something that you wanted to talk about or like how did it come up that we you got to that? Oh, I found   
1:13:11   
this article and I just decided to go through it and so it's okay. Yeah.   
1:13:16   
Um, then I will I don't know what you wanted to talk about next, but I have a relevant segue of sorts. Um,   
1:13:24   
yeah, why don't we do that and then I would like to talk about your stuff that you wanted to go over.   
1:13:29   
Okay. Um, and I didn't Emma for talking about that. I I had really really wanted to have like a website or something I   
1:13:36   
could point to about it because um it's there. I just I haven't had   
1:13:42   
time. I've got sick this week and a lot of things had to be rescheduled so I don't have um as much of that as I'd   
1:13:50   
like. But we can certainly talk about that especially get to my notes about these things. the   
1:13:57   
first but the first uh the direct connection to all of that which I posted   
1:14:02   
in futures uh I was there was a meeting   
1:14:08   
well I guess I posted one of the things from it but there's a really a really um   
1:14:16   
um here in I don't know I don't know how to it's not really   
1:14:22   
um entirely defined yet But um   
1:14:32   
there there's sort of a new group in the area   
1:14:39   
and it's going by the computational philosophy club um at at MIT I guess but not not   
1:14:49   
necessarily exclusive to that and it's related to something that I've I've mentioned before but the meeting this week. The   
1:14:57   
first half of the meet the first yeah half of the meeting was a meeting a discussion between Josh Bach uh will   
1:15:05   
will Han and Elon Baron Holtz. The latter two are part of um Florida   
1:15:11   
Atlantic and then the Complexity Center and Mind Center and our professions there. And Josh is I think his main   
1:15:20   
affiliation now is the California Institute for like um   
1:15:26   
uh basically machine machine intelligence or or machine like it's an AI research institute California. Um it   
1:15:34   
was interesting because one of the things that came up in the discussion was like east coast versus west coast. basically San Francisco or the Bay Area   
1:15:40   
versus Boston and their take on things. Um but more to to the point of this it   
1:15:46   
was a lot of um talk on computation and   
1:15:51   
and the club itself is sort of this loose um computation of philosophy uh   
1:15:57   
bent but it it was also potentially going to be like called the Alactory   
1:16:03   
Club uh because it's interested in this sort of   
1:16:08   
A good portion of the presenters were people doing things around um   
1:16:14   
scent or sensing basically and and how does that relate to you know   
1:16:19   
computation or ideas or or whatnot. I know that echolopto which is what kind   
1:16:25   
of what the association the main supporting group is has a very   
1:16:30   
particular interest in like olfactory or sensebased language and all that stuff.   
1:16:37   
But interesting ties to it kind of go to um   
1:16:44   
the the first the first half the second half of the event um to report on it was   
1:16:51   
was a few different people have been very interesting. One of them was this um one one of the presenters was   
1:16:57   
actually basing their research project off of um   
1:17:03   
a a Japanese ancient uh Japanese incense   
1:17:08   
smelling or identifying game. uh I think called like is it related to this the   
1:17:14   
Genji story and they called their thing like Jenji Genji go or Jenji go   
1:17:21   
um and and it was it was it was something about like uh interesting really phenomenological   
1:17:29   
ties to go in that direction for a moment because what I I I thought of a lot of um our discussions on guerilla   
1:17:36   
and depra and becoming aware and bring this rigor to phenomenological   
1:17:42   
experience and then uh recently at the other event at the summit also the   
1:17:47   
summit post is up I shared that in the slack but that's I've kind of talked about that at length but I distill a lot   
1:17:54   
of my ideas in there can perhaps talk about that later also but   
1:18:00   
at the summit was um Andre Andre uh Gomez   
1:18:06   
from the research And there were some interesting conversations that um I had and others   
1:18:14   
had with him around basically doing the work of um how do you document sort of   
1:18:21   
the first person experience and making it kind of bridging like Mela and and his descendants did bridging the rigor   
1:18:29   
into that space. So it was we that came up a little bit there was one of my questions for the presenter. I believe   
1:18:35   
it was uh Au Chen I believe is his name.   
1:18:41   
Um but he's he's um   
1:18:46   
origin from Japan and Kyoto and um has has a lineage or not a lineage but he's   
1:18:53   
a uh like very famous traditional   
1:18:58   
practices of incense that he was exposed to um were informative in this but it's   
1:19:04   
very interesting because it was sort of like creating this um   
1:19:10   
I don't want to ad hoc, but uh this unique structure based somewhat off of old older Genji practices of identifying   
1:19:21   
the ways that we can experience the layering of sense   
1:19:28   
or the layering of different sensory and scentactory   
1:19:33   
stimuli and approaching. So there's a lot of interesting stuff there. That was sort of the second half of the meeting   
1:19:40   
and and there was other cool presentations as well um including various things about you know you know   
1:19:46   
that kind of work. Um but the first the first half of it with   
1:19:53   
Joshua Bach and Elon and um Will was very interesting in the   
1:20:01   
computational sense of   
1:20:07   
um   
1:20:12   
what one I I'll just I'll just share one thing because it's the easiest thing I can share and it's It's um it's it's   
1:20:18   
it's pretty much at hand. Um   
1:20:24   
yeah. Uh yeah, I'll I'll uh let me do this.   
1:20:31   
Apologies for this. Um okay, here we go.   
1:20:37   
Yeah, I think this works. Sure. No, I can't   
1:20:44   
get to it. All right. Anyway, um so here's sort of the event specifically.   
1:20:49   
Um these folks were there. It was that   
1:20:54   
time. Um the videos up now for that one of was uh   
1:21:02   
from Josh this universality hypothes.   
1:21:11   
And I feel like it's interesting to kind of compare um should be some other ones here too   
1:21:17   
that aren't showing. It's interesting to compare um like yeah we kind of talked   
1:21:24   
about this binding problem but not as much as I hoped honestly. it kind of became Joshua Bach talked about a lot of   
1:21:31   
ideas which is fine but I I wanted to talk a little bit more about this what what Elon's getting at in terms of   
1:21:41   
um one of the things that Elon has is sort of this um   
1:21:47   
his he's examining a lot of L like what what do LLM really tell us about language and structure all this stuff   
1:21:54   
and and I forget I forget what specifically called, but it's he has a video he gets at one of his the core   
1:22:01   
ideas of whose problem is like the mind body problem or something like that. Um   
1:22:08   
and and his conclusion as it's the problem of language. And so he's kind of   
1:22:14   
approaching um it's interesting to me because Elon seems very uh   
1:22:22   
he's very celebratory of large language models and and oh they can understand so   
1:22:29   
much and they can do so much and that's obviously true in some cases. Uh, but he's also   
1:22:34   
um he's also a cognitive scientist, but he's also not quite the gadfly or critic   
1:22:42   
that Gary Marcus is about certain things. Yeah. So, his stance is he takes on this   
1:22:48   
stance of um I don't know like I'm I'm trying to to   
1:22:54   
understand his stance not necessarily because I'm a I'm I'm a diehard believer of it. It's much more a sense of   
1:23:01   
um I'm really curious at what the fruit of what he's attempting to get at about it is. Um and that's why I kind of   
1:23:09   
wanted to see more more about this specifically the binding problem and what he's trying to prove with it. Like   
1:23:16   
there was there was one thing that I do think this is relevant which is yeah   
1:23:21   
here's here's one of the things that this came up and was agreed with by folks but but Bach said the existence of   
1:23:27   
LM should show that you can learn causal structures from linguistic symbolics symbols alone that should have been a   
1:23:33   
surprise to a lot of linguist and philosophers um and and it's like I'm curious how I   
1:23:41   
feel about that because I don't quite know yet in the sense of I do think there's sort of a reckoning at hand for   
1:23:48   
a lot of um I think a disagreement between Bach and   
1:23:54   
potentially Elon uh Baron Holtz and uh   
1:24:00   
like Gary Marcus or some other people is Marcus is very bent on like you for   
1:24:06   
those who aren't who Bradley will know what I mean right away but for those who are watching uh a few years ago I I   
1:24:14   
think around 2020 21 when there was those AI debates, right? The Americas was holding these like AI debate 1, AI   
1:24:20   
debate 2, AI debate three and some of them were debates, some of them are more presenting alternatives to like heavy   
1:24:27   
deep learning I guess um or just just critical of mainstream stuff at the time   
1:24:33   
and whatnot. And one of the things was uh like the future's hybrid like this   
1:24:39   
really heavy focus on hybrid um systems as in the necessity of certain symbolic   
1:24:44   
logic to sort of ground or um complement deep learning things and how do we make   
1:24:51   
these hybrid architectures and so on and so forth. And I think   
1:24:57   
um it's very interesting to see you know Richard Sutton and the bitter lesson   
1:25:04   
came up here as it does in a lot of these conversations and it's really you know um it's interesting to kind of see   
1:25:10   
where things are playing out in this space relative to and the better   
1:25:16   
lesson is basically um not trying to hardcode specific   
1:25:22   
expertise and and more broadly focusing on   
1:25:29   
what can computation what what is what is what is how do you   
1:25:36   
continue to pursue the like I don't really want to use the word first   
1:25:42   
principles but like the complete the nature of computation itself as   
1:25:50   
opposed to trying to optimize what are tenable or discrete chunks of it to   
1:25:56   
specific measures or metrics. Um and and maybe that's not really the best way to say   
1:26:02   
it. So if you if you want to jump in or clarify that you're welcome to do that but   
1:26:08   
um in the context of this discussion in the context of the computation again I missed I missed a lot of it. Uh the post   
1:26:16   
I I I wondering I'm wondering to kind of go back to the post to mention it. I really wonder about that too. Like I   
1:26:22   
don't I I   
1:26:28   
I I will make an admission that I or confession I suppose better.   
1:26:35   
I remember getting really really really excited when I saw I think it was like MIT center for brains minds and machine   
1:26:42   
or something something probably the better part of a decade ago when I first applied or something with   
1:26:47   
them about oh yeah computation and it means this and this is what it's doing and and so on and it was it was the way   
1:26:54   
it was framed on the website was like really kind of clear at time to me like okay that makes sense and now s of this   
1:27:01   
you know um there's an upcoming there's an upcoming coming um   
1:27:09   
uh event. Yeah, hold on a second.   
1:27:16   
Yeah, there's a there's an upcoming event u next week um with a similar group of the echolic folks with uh Will   
1:27:24   
Han and Baron Holtz will be in San Francisco blah blah blah and the topic   
1:27:29   
is a technical conversation about reinterpreting uh civilizations all those questions whatever models   
1:27:34   
framework ideas rituals under the framework of modern computation and I think that's kind of a you know modern   
1:27:42   
modern computation is both um a a thing but also uh a way by which um if you   
1:27:51   
have if you have something comput like in a sense in in essence computation to have to have your computational model of   
1:27:58   
it is a little bit like um well we have a do you have the AI do you have are you   
1:28:04   
using AI or not um in a very in in in   
1:28:09   
one sense and not the whole sense and I'm not trying to discredit computation by saying there sort of an element of   
1:28:15   
well if it doesn't have a computational component and you're not doing a computational modeling of it then what are you doing you know like you don't   
1:28:23   
you you got to you got to find a way to bring computation otherwise you're just not respected in certain ways and lights   
1:28:30   
and that's that's I'm being loosed and fast in my usage of that but what I said   
1:28:36   
um about this event is like I would like to submit a particular uh section discussion uh identifying that which   
1:28:43   
cannot be understood or interpreted well via computation and in particular how it   
1:28:49   
relates to or deviates from cognitive science as in hexagonal traditional cog   
1:28:56   
um and its attempt to unify things neuroscience AI philosophy anthropology   
1:29:01   
via computation um and and sort of the cognitive science project into this you know 5060s and   
1:29:08   
beyond um and where that went or not and it's sort of relation ship to to go all   
1:29:14   
the way back now to linguistics and to computation and you know I was you know we've had many conversations here about   
1:29:22   
you know is there even institutions I've been at what endured wasn't even the   
1:29:28   
cognitive science it was a cognitive science minor in the linguistics department you know and and just to kind   
1:29:36   
of run out full circle it's like yeah like you have the analogy of computation   
1:29:41   
that does work and you have actual computation and you're kind of in this   
1:29:47   
space of you know what what what is it you know what what   
1:29:52   
what are you trying to get at and and and there's sort of this I think my last   
1:29:58   
point will basically be um   
1:30:04   
there's there's a sort of necessary humility to realizing   
1:30:11   
the convenience or readiness of certain analogies um   
1:30:19   
versus the function of what is it doing. And I find that to be I'm assuming some of the art the article that you   
1:30:24   
originally came all this up with that you presented is is kind of addressing   
1:30:30   
addressing that based upon what you said like where does the analogy   
1:30:35   
hold or kind of fade out the metaphor?   
1:30:42   
Yeah, this is great because this dovetales quite nicely with this article. So you know one of the things   
1:30:48   
they talked about in the article is uh so this this thing up at the top of what your screen that you're sharing at the   
1:30:54   
one hour or five minute mark says univers universality hypothesis the   
1:31:01   
structure of the model depends on the mathematical problem not the algorithm data or architecture and there was this   
1:31:08   
part in the article where they talked about you know is computation   
1:31:13   
when we say that let's say life where the brain is computing something. Are we   
1:31:19   
talking about actual some actual computational structure some sort of um   
1:31:24   
natural structure like we you know we we observe in mathematics and we celebrate in mathematics   
1:31:30   
or is it just an an artifact of our rules that we apply to the system. So do we say like uh you know if we apply an   
1:31:37   
algorithm to some biological process we get out an answer that looks like it's   
1:31:43   
you know um that it that it conforms to the algorithm that solves a problem but really we're just applying a   
1:31:50   
computational mathematical u cultural practice or cultural set of   
1:31:55   
rules to a natural system. That's kind of like when we analyze something with   
1:32:01   
statistics and we either, you know, we get an interesting result or sometimes we get   
1:32:08   
something that is a spurious result. Um, and you know, we have to distinguish   
1:32:14   
between the two. Yeah. I mean, and and I'm a little   
1:32:19   
confused in how to make that distinction, but um I think that yeah, they're going in the same direction.   
1:32:25   
they're considering the same set of issues which I think is really interesting um without any reference to   
1:32:31   
any of the readings that we had in the article. So they don't talk about Wickinstein or Turing but they're just   
1:32:37   
basically saying yeah these are problems and let's talk about them.   
1:32:45   
Yeah, this uh universal universality hunch this is also one of your posts.   
1:32:52   
model structures may converge more on problems and architectures.   
1:32:57   
So I mean if you take that another way you could say that um model structures   
1:33:03   
kind of converge maybe upon function. Yeah, I just think that there are a lot of connections here. Really interesting   
1:33:09   
work. So yeah, that's that's something we should check out more. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.   
1:33:20   
Um I'm trying to get to something that I wanted to talk about for the what I'm   
1:33:27   
doing with JPro. Um I don't know if you want to do that right now or you want to come back to it in a   
1:33:32   
Yeah, we can do that now. Okay. Um   
1:33:40   
All right. Okay. Um turn this off. I don't think I   
1:33:47   
can share anything. Oh, before Let me let me um   
1:33:59   
there was a concluding thought that I had about this. Um   
1:34:07   
I don't know. It scares me a little bit. Um but as far as Job Pro, um it's been a   
1:34:14   
really good week of refining what I want. I I have very I don't have   
1:34:20   
anything um visual yet to show about it.   
1:34:26   
Um but oh one of the things I did one of the things that a a key theme that's   
1:34:33   
sort of related to what we were talking about and a little bit about the universality hypothesis stuff is um   
1:34:42   
uh   
1:34:47   
I I had a discussion maybe maybe I'll just maybe what I'll do in place of it is   
1:34:55   
M I don't know. It's not It's not really what I wanted to talk about. It's easy   
1:35:00   
to talk about, but it's not quite um uh what I really wanted things to be.   
1:35:06   
And things are loading slowly here. So maybe maybe I'll for like a very I'll do I'll do a very a very uh   
1:35:15   
poor Okay, maybe it's loading. But what I what I was going to mention that does   
1:35:21   
fit at large within the broader confines of what I'm trying to do with it   
1:35:26   
currently named future study center. Um I had a discussion with um I suppose a   
1:35:34   
few people this week because it came up in my in the data internship. One of our interests is focusing on AI and quality   
1:35:41   
um and education. And one of the articles in that um   
1:35:48   
one of the articles that we came across in that process I think I might have found it was a Atlantic or Time article   
1:35:56   
that was written from the point of view of a high schooler uh saying basically saying you know AI   
1:36:03   
is making us uh less good at being students making us   
1:36:10   
procrastinate more Um, it it enables there's there's more to the article, but   
1:36:17   
we we basically only talked about the first couple paragraphs of it. And I'm not I'm   
1:36:23   
not I'm not saying this is what the student thinks. I'm I'm I'm just mentioning this to abstract out a very   
1:36:30   
specific topic of discussion. uh which is um one of the conclusions of the   
1:36:36   
first section of the article was um I'll try I'm trying to pull it up here.   
1:36:44   
Um actually it might be really easy to find   
1:36:50   
this way. One more second here. It was essentially   
1:36:56   
discussing um basically the conclusion of the article got something something along the lines   
1:37:02   
of um the kid who's a high schooler and I think it's very important I think it's very important to emphasize is written   
1:37:10   
from the point of view of someone who is not not even yet gone to college and has been exposed to certain things but their   
1:37:16   
point was saying um I I think there's sort of you know downward downward   
1:37:21   
pressure on the quality of education because deadlines that matter. You can procrastinate. Um the discipline the   
1:37:29   
discipline one of the lines was very much the discipline of having to do complicated things within a short timeline   
1:37:35   
um is now lost like that just that pressure to do to   
1:37:40   
learn that kind of discipline um has been taken away and and now the role you   
1:37:48   
know there's a negative outcome from that and what it led to was a Birch brother discussion on at least for me   
1:37:56   
philosophically And this this came up in some other um I have a a colleague of   
1:38:02   
mine who is uh doing a program in   
1:38:07   
systemic change behav behavior and systemic change. Um and it was very   
1:38:13   
interesting like a as a as a applied um like graduate course work   
1:38:19   
and it was very interesting to have a conversation with all of us around this in the sense of what I wanted to   
1:38:26   
abstract from this particular topic and I I will eventually tie this a bit into   
1:38:31   
future study stuff more but like and more conventionally this conver conversation will be under the uh the   
1:38:39   
sort of so so I think I' I've reached for a name of as ingenious as like the   
1:38:46   
educational banner of of Orthogonal Lab like this this this this group this   
1:38:51   
really meaningful but never really defined discussion space that we often come back to about how are we teaching   
1:38:58   
how are we doing how not just project manager but the pedigogy the the the   
1:39:03   
nature of trying to educate or create spaces for folks to to do the learning   
1:39:09   
you know all that kind of Again to go back to the article where the the student is saying yeah there we're   
1:39:16   
losing this opportunity to build this very important discipline of XYZ and   
1:39:21   
when I first read the article my honest reaction and again I'm a bit privileged   
1:39:27   
uh but alsical   
1:39:33   
selection that circumvents some of the problem in the following way. But my initial reaction was, geez, I totally   
1:39:42   
get and there is a there's a there's a very real value to discipline. And I   
1:39:47   
think that's especially true this I'll put it this way, discipline relative to   
1:39:53   
here is a deadline, find a way to make it work. There is something that will only come through that particular lens.   
1:40:02   
And I'm not out on it. But um and this is why I say I think this is something   
1:40:08   
that a student would definitely not really know yet unless they were intentionally exposed to it as in a high   
1:40:14   
schooler or a 15 16 17 year old person. I had such a strong missile reaction to   
1:40:21   
seeing the language of of the article because it's like oh well I I'm running   
1:40:27   
internship right now and I've been a part of this um myself but I I'm I've   
1:40:33   
now I've successfully done it and created a situation that has no timeline of any of any real consequence   
1:40:41   
and the discipline is very strong. the discipline that that which we are trying   
1:40:47   
to achieve or build or cultivate or make as pedagogical or educational space the   
1:40:53   
skill development comes because people want to do the thing they want you could   
1:41:00   
say intrinsic motivation but also um I I I kind of I I I   
1:41:07   
sherk or or shrink or recoil um I recoil a little bit at the intrinsic versus   
1:41:14   
exttrinsic motivation centering what I'm trying to say because yes that is a valid lens but I think there's something   
1:41:21   
more to it in the sense of and particularly in in the data indirection   
1:41:26   
stuff which in terms that I'm referencing but not just them other things um it's it's because people see   
1:41:35   
the need and because they believe   
1:41:40   
that what they're trying to do matters. They realize that discipline isn't   
1:41:47   
something external to just be adhered to or um comply or satisfy to just not to   
1:41:58   
avoid the negative. I don't want to be I want to do well and I don't want to get punished. I don't want to fail. I don't   
1:42:04   
want to get a bad grade. I'm going to do it versus I want to make this change in the world or I want to make money from   
1:42:10   
this or I want to succeed or I want I want to generate something of value. It   
1:42:19   
could be moral value or non-moral value. I want to do something of value to me in   
1:42:24   
the world which necessitates the discipline. And even also you can we   
1:42:31   
didn't I didn't talk about this at all but there's a whole other aspect of this which is like there is also a discipline   
1:42:37   
in play when you are actually enjoying it and you're wanting to experience or   
1:42:44   
or do the thing that is not even productive not even about value generation but just there is a   
1:42:49   
discipline to the to the earnest engagement of the subject matter. Um so   
1:42:56   
the discussions that that kind of came up this week around this topic and one of them was in this this came up in a   
1:43:01   
few different domains. Some of them data and direction itself because we were talking about the article but then also systemic change uh pedagogy education   
1:43:09   
and whatnot. um was just similar in in a very this is a very big stretch and I I   
1:43:16   
acknowledge this but similar to the universality hypothesis of the structure of the model depends on the mathematical problem not algorithm data or structure   
1:43:23   
architecture. I I find the discipline issue to be a very interesting   
1:43:30   
um when you look at the the issue of   
1:43:35   
discipline and I'll say I'll even say I don't know if I want to call it a skill um but but something that's the   
1:43:44   
the the useful quality that is having or developing or cultivating discipline I   
1:43:51   
think it's very interesting to consider um in an in a purely like pur purely   
1:43:58   
abstracted pedagogical sense. Yes, there are many different ways that you can   
1:44:04   
present a student to   
1:44:10   
willingfully engage in developing discipline about something. Um that's a nice sort of really highbrow   
1:44:20   
um not even ivory tower but just like kind of pristine point of view in a much more gritty um uh reality touching the   
1:44:28   
ground touching the grass touching the reality of the situation. We are and this is very much centered in in what   
1:44:34   
we're looking at in some of the AI and education stuff. Um you we are forced to deal with a reality   
1:44:43   
where some of the causal uh in let's say incentive   
1:44:48   
structures around teaching are not as applicable as they were like   
1:44:56   
there was a time when you it was just you and your tablet your in Rome your   
1:45:04   
ancient wax tablet it was it was that and maybe some scriptures, you know, some some uh scrolls. Uh that was it.   
1:45:12   
You did not have chat GTP. You could talk to some folks and read your stuff and that was what you were there. And   
1:45:18   
so, hey, you better do this. It's going to take you time to read. It's going to take you time to write. It's going to take you time to, you know, red redo   
1:45:24   
your wax tablet. It's going to take you time to like like there was just inevitabilities of what that process did   
1:45:31   
and different incentives and logistics that made certain approaches de facto   
1:45:37   
the best ones available or the ones that were tenable to do certain things. And that's different now. And one of the   
1:45:45   
things we're looking at in data and direction in particular is the choice of how much you can choose uh the ability   
1:45:53   
to opt into uh you know an AI dominated classroom versus an AI uh AI free   
1:46:01   
classroom a phone free classroom um and and you know there's all these different economics and pressures and teachers and   
1:46:07   
being overworked and all like those kind of things but at the level of what do we do about the problem of discipline   
1:46:14   
um we're in a situation where maybe the incentive structure of here's   
1:46:20   
a twoe deadline um you've only got two weeks, you better do   
1:46:25   
this. Um maybe it's just not going to hold the same weight. Um for for better   
1:46:31   
or worse, I'm not I'm not really taking a normative stance on this. I can take a normative stance, but I'm not interested   
1:46:36   
in that right now. It's more of a sense of identifying if if a goal if something   
1:46:42   
we wanted to highlight is the development of discipline. How do we acknowledge that the environment that   
1:46:49   
discip that the environment and the incentives and sort of the pressure or the pedagogical like structuring of   
1:46:56   
situation maybe um is is different now. And my my my final   
1:47:02   
caveat is saying yes, I'm in a very luxurious position with data and   
1:47:07   
direction and other things where I've I've heavily selected for people that   
1:47:12   
want to have a certain uh passion in in a topic that's both somewhat monetarily   
1:47:19   
feasible and and morally compelling. And that is not the same as your sophomore   
1:47:27   
mathematics class for most people or your let's read about   
1:47:33   
um what some some guy in 17th or 18th   
1:47:40   
century wrote that has no real direct connection to your life right now. You can say the work of a teacher is doing   
1:47:46   
all that stuff. I'm I'm just acknowledging a certain um what I'm what I'm sort of loftily   
1:47:52   
suggesting or alluding to I know is not feasible for um your generic uh everyday   
1:48:00   
any town USA uh strapped overworked teacher that isn't going to necessarily   
1:48:06   
get to like your typical like your freedom writers inspirational movie level of of   
1:48:13   
you know capturing some kind of a meaning and all this other stuff. So where to to to to kind of I'll make this   
1:48:20   
point and then you know have room for for comment or whatever but basically how you know   
1:48:29   
I mentioned this situation because I just did a super a super um   
1:48:36   
kind of hand wavy even honestly I I did a very general discussion of discipline   
1:48:42   
of how something was brought up how it's implied in its education and and and kind of diagnosing doing   
1:48:49   
some diagnostics on what's making it it salient. I'm abstracting out the nature   
1:48:55   
of the problem or the the in this case discipline or like skill building when   
1:49:01   
what how do you you know another way of saying the question is like how do you build how do you how do you um develop   
1:49:08   
skills like discipline um in a world where the   
1:49:14   
time burden or a lot of the initial um leg work has a very different value like   
1:49:21   
you maybe don't need two weeks to do the same thing anymore. Like maybe what you want to do is just is there and like   
1:49:28   
we're at at a at a slightly soap boxy sense like we're totally unprepared for this. like there's like it it's super it   
1:49:35   
it is very plain to me and I think people I think I want to try to continue to normalize as much as possible saying   
1:49:42   
we aren't there isn't like there isn't a sense of um the collective   
1:49:51   
big big whatever absment you want you could say the department of education which is like would make you chuckle in   
1:49:57   
some ways but the there's no magical uh abudsman there's no um   
1:50:05   
par parliamentary structure or ministry that is just keeping the entire slew of   
1:50:12   
teachers on the same page about what to do about all this stuff. Like this is   
1:50:17   
literally a very heavy hit uh that is   
1:50:22   
unprepared um and like there's relative chaos about this particular subject. And   
1:50:30   
so I'm saying that out of alarmism, but more like   
1:50:35   
it is appropriate to talk about this like it's a very big sea change and people aren't ready for it. So, in the   
1:50:40   
context of all of that, what am I what am I trying to get at here is like   
1:50:46   
one, the reality is we're in we're in a different era and whether or not we   
1:50:51   
don't even know if that era is going to continue necessarily, but for the moment, what is available, what is   
1:50:57   
tenable, and how it's going to be used is um very different and very new. Now take   
1:51:05   
and my my conclusion for this is basically the problem of discipline is interesting   
1:51:12   
in and of itself. The sort of proposed or interesting or lofty solution that I   
1:51:18   
have is about it is sort of well I think there's something to getting   
1:51:23   
people to find a way to build what they want to build. Like how do you get them to   
1:51:29   
having you could say flipped classroom, you could say incentive, you could say intrinsic motivation, but how do you get   
1:51:37   
them to think that it it matters not just to have discipline, but to show   
1:51:44   
them a meaningful way that what they want to do inherently requires this   
1:51:51   
discipline. And that's great. to zoom it out even further. What I'd like to do in   
1:51:57   
some aspects of the future studies is identify this type of thing across   
1:52:04   
various domains. um particularly education particularly   
1:52:09   
knowledge generation particularly how science and education work particularly   
1:52:15   
the there's sort of an inherent one of the things I really want to look at in the future study center is this   
1:52:20   
how are we a very a very sober assessment of and I   
1:52:26   
kind of even tried to get at this in the original part of my talk and I don't think I did a good job about the previous topic was how are we   
1:52:35   
very aware of what is making certain   
1:52:43   
approaches or views tenable and how does that change like why like like a really   
1:52:49   
examining to use to use the disciplining as as sort of this e easily very accessible topic like why why   
1:52:57   
you know what what I would have loved and I haven't I haven't fully read the article I haven't read I certainly haven't talked to the author but I would   
1:53:04   
love to say to them like yes um the means by which you have been shown to   
1:53:11   
develop the skill set of around discipline has become disincentivified like the   
1:53:18   
pressure to do it that way is is less now and I would love to ask them how do   
1:53:24   
you think you will like where do you want to go like is it a valuable thing for you to learn but also like how do   
1:53:30   
you see yourself as as acquiring this or being in a space where you want to develop discipline   
1:53:35   
um whatever that particularly means. And I don't know, um   
1:53:43   
I think there's a space for bringing a   
1:53:49   
bit of rigor and a bit of inherent uh like almost metaccient   
1:53:57   
um philosophy and history of the fields.   
1:54:02   
and then really trying to map out where the alternatives lie like what like okay   
1:54:08   
the the prescriptive and this is I'm not going to go I'm not going to I'm for a   
1:54:13   
viewer they won't understand the context of this but that's that's okay I'm I'm just going to kind of wrap up here and   
1:54:20   
say for the descriptive pro part of the the future center of things you could you could do this documentation of what   
1:54:26   
has been and why for the prescriptive part of it you might have these suggestions about where it can go. Like   
1:54:34   
what are these alternatives? Like how do you center project based learning or or particularly project projects some the   
1:54:42   
the building of something in the world that's somewhat tied to a meaning or or value and and and and how much can you   
1:54:48   
afford doing the work of actually trying to know what that is like in a in a in a   
1:54:54   
very ideal different world. Maybe you're having almost like intake with your students   
1:54:59   
and you understand what is what is their disconnect about feeling agency and   
1:55:06   
autonomy and the ability to build like those are related components but in the way the education is currently   
1:55:11   
structured. We don't we your job as a teacher isn't to have an intake and and a therapy session with them. That's   
1:55:17   
that's silly. That's totally not the case. Even if maybe it actually is. But   
1:55:22   
in in conventional stuff, that's not what you're supposed to do. Um, this is this isn't a dead poet society. You   
1:55:28   
know, that's for the movies. And and you know, the tension is there. So   
1:55:35   
that's there's this isn't I don't I don't think I will I will conclude here and I I   
1:55:43   
don't think my project um and what I've just said really um   
1:55:48   
holds a lot of weight or sounds um is not a great showing for what I   
1:55:55   
want to do when I'm talking about the future center but it's a very relevant discussion that happened this week and I   
1:56:02   
think talking about discipline in high school education is nice. Um, but   
1:56:12   
I I don't I don't I don't want the future center to be just about that. I I   
1:56:18   
kind of try to use it as an example of some of the framework and lenses I'm trying to flesh out um at a very small   
1:56:26   
scale and a very accessible topic. So, uh I don't know. I'm open to any   
1:56:32   
questions or comments on that. Um, and I know that was maybe   
1:56:38   
unusual uh discussion, but yeah. Any thoughts?   
1:56:44   
No, I I I think that was a great discussion. thinking about how we change the way we   
1:56:50   
learn using technology or using just methods that we kind of adopt that   
1:56:56   
improve things or maybe don't improve things or um and in this case you're talking about   
1:57:04   
having discipline or the value of doing something   
1:57:10   
uh under a certain set of conditions like that's a pedagogical aspect where you know um I'm going to you know   
1:57:16   
blindfold you and you have to like feel inside a box and learn what those things are inside the box, right?   
1:57:23   
That's and then that's or like in the Karate Kid movies where he teaches him   
1:57:28   
how to make movements that are sort of related to the different uh karate moves   
1:57:35   
but it's things trivial things like sanding the floor or waxing a car or something like that. Um so you know   
1:57:42   
there is this aspect of discipline um and how do we achieve   
1:57:48   
discipline you know so we can learn things when we're not in the classroom   
1:57:54   
where you know we might um you know need to transfer our ability   
1:58:00   
to learn to a new domain u I have two questions though um the   
1:58:05   
first one is you remember uh several years ago I guess now You used to talk about mastery and then we   
1:58:13   
had this whole discussion about how that fits into cybernetics and there was a lot of discussion about cybernetics and   
1:58:19   
mastery and all that. Um and and so how does this what is the relationship   
1:58:24   
between discipline and mastery? Yeah. Can you I I can you refresh me a   
1:58:31   
little bit of some of those discussions because it sounds really cool honestly   
1:58:37   
and I doesn't trigger like I feel like I'm at the door but I can't look inside the   
1:58:43   
room yet. So can you tell me a little bit about what those discussions were? Well, as I recall, there was this uh   
1:58:50   
theme in cybernetics and I can't remember who it could have been Norbert Weiner and some of his stuff that he   
1:58:57   
talked about. So, he talked about education, he talked about other things and there was this aspect of mastery or   
1:59:04   
mastering certain domains of knowledge and how do you do that and you know I   
1:59:11   
guess you know this is relevant to learning artificial learning as well as   
1:59:16   
biological learning in that you have to learn about a domain,   
1:59:21   
right? So the more you learn about the domain, the more it becomes sort of part of your   
1:59:28   
automatic behavior, you then master that thing. So you can   
1:59:33   
reference anything that you kind of encounter. So like you know when you meet people who have been doing   
1:59:40   
academic research in a certain field for like 40 years they can come up with different references and they can come   
1:59:46   
up with different like points of view immediately whereas a new person might have it might they might struggle to   
1:59:53   
find the right answer or they might it might take them a while to make the connections.   
1:59:59   
Um now that that's that is to say I don't know how much you know we could do   
2:00:04   
a build a cybernetic model of mastery but there is this aspect of like you   
2:00:09   
know what does it take to become a master right expertise but but in   
2:00:14   
practice maybe it's a long-term perspective so like you know do we need   
2:00:23   
I guess my another way to phrase my question is do we need discipline or certain types of discip discipline are   
2:00:29   
they required for mastery or is this just something that we can you know it's   
2:00:34   
just a different kind of process. Okay. And and you mean um that makes   
2:00:41   
sense. Thank you. And when you when you're saying does I I kind of I kind of think I know this but just to ask you to   
2:00:47   
add a question at face value. When you when you're saying discipline, I I assume you mean like   
2:00:56   
the discipline that that I was talking about in the other   
2:01:02   
thing like ahead. Yeah. Like developing like the ability   
2:01:08   
to think under pressure or to think in a certain amount of time.   
2:01:14   
Yeah. It's so interesting because like even the word discipline um I think in a   
2:01:20   
lot of modern sense has this sort of militant uh Nazi   
2:01:25   
uh basic trade. you like discipline. Arnold Schwarzenegger uh sound bite and   
2:01:33   
um I find it to be Yeah. like like there's sort of this   
2:01:40   
there's sort of this um I don't want to say two cultures like divide and like CP   
2:01:47   
but but like a difference between oh he's a really disciplined uh sports football player or he's a   
2:01:55   
really disciplined mathematician or he's a really disciplined businessman or he's a really disciplined artist or writer he   
2:02:02   
writes all the time or he's really disciplined to his craft of um anything honestly And so   
2:02:11   
your the broad question here is discipline as relation to mastery and so   
2:02:16   
on. Uh to say a bit more about discipline first is   
2:02:24   
I think I don't really like the word discipline   
2:02:31   
from what it's trying to get out of my mind. And maybe it's just because it's loaded and has these connotations over   
2:02:36   
cultural references or whatever. Um because yeah like when I think of the   
2:02:43   
word discipline I just think of all these different things that were said just said and then also like the   
2:02:50   
idea of developing a discipline of study too like that's a different meaning of the same word. But what I I'm trying to   
2:02:57   
get to and I'm I'm I'm rephrasing your question a little bit so I can try to get to how I interpret the core of it   
2:03:05   
because I think the core of it is important. So discipline   
2:03:10   
um and sort of this intentional   
2:03:15   
and you know I say this acknowledging I'm someone who I I grew up as the son of a martial arts teacher um and   
2:03:26   
The cultivation of the skill was very um   
2:03:33   
it requires discipline, but I really see I really see it much more as   
2:03:40   
um an earnesty of wanting to know   
2:03:46   
yourself and or the thing like it's I actually associate it quite a bit with   
2:03:51   
like the capacity to love in a particular way like not to be in to the   
2:03:57   
in the fields part of it but but are you I actually I actually just   
2:04:03   
I just wrote about this somewhere else actually in the context of at its core I think it's about are you   
2:04:10   
are you rigorously attempting to update your model   
2:04:16   
you're in a cybernetic sense um and every regulator sense that you will are   
2:04:21   
you willing to update the states that you can account for and relentlessly   
2:04:27   
diligently do that. So, I don't think discipline is necessarily doing your 50 push-ups or memorizing your   
2:04:32   
multiplication tables or um   
2:04:38   
uh you know writing 2,000 words a day. Um I think it's much I think at its core   
2:04:47   
like what you want what what you want to still in a pedagogical sense is   
2:04:55   
reverence. Oh, okay. Now I can now I can throw it back to Norbert Norbert. Um the   
2:05:01   
quote that I've said many times, especially years ago, and you may even think about this, but if it's come, it's   
2:05:07   
resurfaced now. uh uh uh something about along the lines of of uh doing scholarly   
2:05:15   
work or being scholastic in its truest sense is is is more of a a consecration   
2:05:20   
or a duty. Like you there's there's a there's a reverence to it as opposed to just a job. like like if you're really   
2:05:28   
trying to learn there's a certain investment like a commitment to   
2:05:33   
understanding the edge cases the outliers uh understanding the degree at   
2:05:38   
which the problem is like you really getting into and incentivizing   
2:05:44   
you you learn to appreciate the the challenge of the domain space   
2:05:51   
and you consistently show up wanting to know more like you want   
2:05:56   
you when you're just I think this is a discipline but is also just   
2:06:02   
uh um in a phenomenological internal learning sense you re you have a sense   
2:06:09   
of I don't think interception is the right word but you have a legitimate sense of   
2:06:15   
the problem space being represented adequately or not of a lot of the things   
2:06:20   
I'm interested and what I really one of the things I want to do under the banner of the future studies institute   
2:06:26   
is I want to center something that I'm calling steelman the problem space as   
2:06:32   
opposed to your side of the debate. I want to center how great it can be to   
2:06:39   
really really really really really identify discuss the problem space itself as opposed to just whatever   
2:06:47   
schools of thought on it. And I think that's a huge paradigmatic shift. We talk a lot about uh synthetic   
2:06:53   
conferences and design to not really be synthetic in a lot of their stuff. I'm just vag.   
2:06:59   
But but like I want there to be a new model of uh debate. Debate's very popular right now for reasons I'm not   
2:07:06   
even going to get into. But the idea of oh come debate me and and prove me wrong and all this other stuff. It's like yeah   
2:07:12   
that's that's fine. Like there's something to that. But I think there's also a very legitimate sense of how do   
2:07:19   
you get people to realize there is I say majesty but there is there's wonder and   
2:07:25   
exhilaration and goodness and rigor to be had in identifying what the actual   
2:07:34   
domain space is what the problem is and in the sense of the the universality   
2:07:40   
thesis as we're calling it right now. Can you identify this problem space across the   
2:07:46   
different domains that it might contain? And how do you engage? How do you have the earnesty of doing that? So, we talk   
2:07:53   
about discipline and mastery to kind of zoom back out again. I feel like it's very much a sense of   
2:08:02   
at a at a at a I'm I'm gonna put on my like coaching hat for a second of like   
2:08:08   
you have to have the buy in and the desire to care about   
2:08:13   
it. Now, where where does that come from? And   
2:08:18   
where what can you do about it? Like there's different roles of I'm in a classroom. I   
2:08:27   
need to get kids to have a baseline minimum rating skill and we just got to do it and here's how we're going to do   
2:08:32   
it. That's very different from   
2:08:37   
I have an intern who passed a very rigorous   
2:08:42   
um application process and they know this matters to them and they just want   
2:08:49   
structure and someone to talk to about something they have in mind. Those are those are different things. But like   
2:08:56   
depending on where in those spectrum you are, how do you incentivize people to pursue those things now? and to come all   
2:09:03   
the way back out to like discipline and mastery. I feel like mastery in this   
2:09:10   
context is sort of, you know, you can say sploon across time   
2:09:16   
and and I kind of also had this this sort of tangent of like will we ever get to the state where it's the matrix and   
2:09:22   
you can download like like how does that change the thing? And it's like, well, I don't   
2:09:28   
know. We're not really there yet. Um, so we don't have to worry about it. But I do I do think it's worthy considering   
2:09:35   
can mastery be accelerated or we've talked before many times about what was it the minimum viable theory, minimum   
2:09:42   
viable like theoretical knowledge of a domain to do something space and that   
2:09:47   
kind of some of the frontier math discussion epistemological directories.   
2:09:54   
But yeah, I mean I think it comes down to I think so much of the work right now   
2:10:00   
and this is my my obvious like gigantic personal bias and lean. I think so much of the work right now is   
2:10:06   
clarifying and illuminating relative destination spaces for a theory, an idea   
2:10:13   
or the outcome like like you can do you can you can say I want to take this domain space in a direction or the   
2:10:22   
applied I I want to I want to find things that are going to make this aspect of the world more likely or   
2:10:28   
this aspect of the world less likely. Whichever of those things I'm agnostic and this   
2:10:33   
particular point of view that having I think I think we're in a world   
2:10:40   
where the actual act of building to pursue one   
2:10:46   
of those destinations or at least like an an informed sense of an informed   
2:10:51   
juaposed sense in the future center uh language that I'm building out   
2:10:57   
alternatives like the key word is alternatives how do you identify   
2:11:02   
an an alternative that is meaningful or valuable or tenable or interesting and   
2:11:08   
and you know how do you go there like that requires to to do that um requires   
2:11:16   
a I think it requires discipline um and eventually ideally the better it   
2:11:22   
is the more mastery of the problem space and mastery not just of the problem space but of the the bridge you're   
2:11:27   
building to reach that that destination the bridge across the vantage points my   
2:11:33   
old vantage points article that I should properly publish now like how do you go   
2:11:38   
from the current to the other and translate back and forth so there can be feedback between the different vantage   
2:11:43   
points all these things so that that's probably a bit more   
2:11:50   
um I think you said you had two questions and I just totally with one of them but I don't know do you have any   
2:11:55   
thoughts about about that was a bit of a winding road usual well no I think that was Good. Uh leads   
2:12:02   
to the second question and maybe it's more of a comment which is that you know we often times will impose discipline   
2:12:12   
kind of you know through how long do we want to take to learn something or how long do you have to learn something?   
2:12:17   
So, in a classroom setting, you know, we'll have deadlines for assignments and, you know, usually it's like I'll   
2:12:24   
I'll give someone a week or two weeks to do something. And I don't expect them to,   
2:12:31   
you know, like sometimes there's a temptation when I ask you a question to dump like 20 paragraphs, right? Or to   
2:12:39   
write like a very refined answer that is like well researched. But   
2:12:45   
that's not what I'm trying to get at. an assignment like that. What I want to know is I just want to get your feedback   
2:12:51   
on what what I'm I'm asking you. And then you know you can have that kind of   
2:12:56   
an assignment or you can have like a term paper which is over maybe three months and you know you have the entire   
2:13:03   
term to write this. Maybe it's a more refined research paper where I ask you to go get references and engage in a   
2:13:11   
larger structure in in the document. So you're maybe asking a question or you're   
2:13:18   
exploring some topic but you're giving me multi a multi-party answer basically.   
2:13:25   
Um you know if we if I give you like a qualifying exam where you know I might   
2:13:30   
say I'm going to ask you a question you have 24 hours to answer it you know. So,   
2:13:36   
I mean, I want your answer in 24 hours. Here's a question. You go, you know, answer it and then send it to me and I   
2:13:44   
read it and it's, you know, it doesn't need to be like a wellressearched paper. Just needs to be something that shows me   
2:13:50   
that, you know, some topic. So, we have all these structures in education that   
2:13:57   
are kind of disciplinary in that sense. It just gives you like here's something   
2:14:02   
I want to know. I want to gauge your feedback. Yes. And I'm giving you a certain amount of   
2:14:08   
time and the point is is not to like I mean the point is to do a good job in   
2:14:15   
that limited amount of time and if I do this like over time, you know, I I   
2:14:20   
should have I should expect like better performance, I guess. But that's not really the point. The point is is that I   
2:14:27   
want to like put you in a situation where you have to give me some insight in a small amount of time. Yes.   
2:14:34   
Yeah. And and so we do that, but it's like, you know, maybe it's maybe to your   
2:14:40   
point, it's more it's it's something that we should use more strategically   
2:14:46   
throughout learning things that, you know, maybe it is a good way to do this.   
2:14:52   
um or to to sort of deploy it strategically in a way maybe   
2:14:58   
for artificial learning or if you're talking about a new domain where we need   
2:15:03   
to learn things and um we need to gauge like how people are adapting to some new   
2:15:09   
technology, you know, we can see how they perform on those kinds of things and and evaluate   
2:15:16   
it. Yes. Yes. I I'm very I very much appreciate   
2:15:21   
this comment because it it there are many things I want to say and I hope I can say all of them before I forget   
2:15:27   
them. But to jump to one of the more important ones is I think what we're dealing with is and I   
2:15:34   
did a very I I alluded to this but I didn't hit it very well on the first pass. Um,   
2:15:45   
what the advent of chatp does in some ways is   
2:15:52   
we now are forced to   
2:15:58   
we're more face to face with what the student actually knows or doesn't know.   
2:16:08   
However, the means by which we   
2:16:14   
collect the feedback, collect the iterate like prompt the iteration   
2:16:21   
are different or can you know whatever and what what to again to stay on this   
2:16:29   
you can get around this by simply just saying okay   
2:16:34   
we're not like nice and thank you for writing your paper and not not in a way   
2:16:39   
not in a gotcha way but like in a legit way you know thank you for writing your paper now   
2:16:47   
do the like tell me about it like you tell me about the paper and the meaning of what did you learn like the fact that   
2:16:54   
it's generated automatically in 10 seconds doesn't change   
2:17:01   
uh that if you're trying to communicate the merit of it you still have to do that you the the actual the actual um   
2:17:10   
does it change the person? Do they know it? Can they ever comment on it? If if it's just you could in I don't know you   
2:17:16   
can say have a look at the paper or not but like does the person know how to wield what   
2:17:21   
whatever is they're supposed to learn or not like that's you can't we're not at least right now   
2:17:29   
from what I've seen and what I've experienced even my own use of it like I I use GDB   
2:17:34   
all the time in in the internships right now um in part because I'm not interested in I'm not interested in the   
2:17:40   
busy work I don't I don't care about that I literally want to So   
2:17:45   
what do you know? What are you trying to build? What are we doing? And I don't think I'm not saying that's how teaching should be because I'm not as I said many   
2:17:52   
times disclaimer I'm making disclaimer many times for purpose but like I'm not in a typical situation and I've   
2:18:00   
crafted the situation very specifically because I don't want to be in that situation. Um, but to to stay on point,   
2:18:08   
yes, like at its core, and I'll I'll to finish that point again and try to   
2:18:14   
try to hit it on a different angle, is um we still have the challenge of getting   
2:18:23   
to know what a student knows or not. like in generic education   
2:18:31   
where you are trying to verify if a core   
2:18:36   
fundamental feature of something has been ascertained or not that is the like   
2:18:42   
GDP doesn't just take that away like it's there right and we have a   
2:18:49   
opportunity here is can we talk it's so funny because we say we all about oh AI   
2:18:57   
I will offer really tailored experiences and learning for the student. And it's like do you have really tailored   
2:19:03   
experiences from the educator with the student to facilitate the transmission   
2:19:08   
of the understanding and of the feedback? Like it's nice that they student can get XYZ but like how is it   
2:19:15   
where's the connection to it? Like what's the complete feedback loop of the whole you know the educational ecosystem   
2:19:23   
in the classroom? Right. Right. to to put that aside. I think   
2:19:29   
as you were as you were saying all that, I think what another key thing ingrained of what   
2:19:36   
you were saying about the deadlines, the structure, is it this paper? Is it a valid? Is it a term paper? Like   
2:19:41   
and it's so interesting because I honestly I thought about some of these things, but it wasn't until you said it   
2:19:47   
I felt a very particular difference. And now that I'm doing teaching, now that I'm someone I think someone very nice to   
2:19:53   
me, oh Jesse, happy teachers day. like a teacher   
2:19:59   
like oh like well I'm doing this in thing people are seeing this way like oh I have a I have a master's degree like   
2:20:06   
it's like it was it didn't really connect and it's like I think they were just being nice basic to be honest with   
2:20:12   
you but there was a sense of   
2:20:18   
hearing you say it and having the sort of camaraderie now of designing some of those things myself   
2:20:25   
um at least at least in a much more formal way than ever before is   
2:20:32   
it's so different and I I I kind of I was just I had in in the discussion it   
2:20:37   
was this moment of oh yeah like   
2:20:43   
I I had I was to share with you the educational administrative perspective of like well we have like 10 weeks and I   
2:20:50   
got to give them time to sort things out and I have to break the time in this ways and I have to let like some of the   
2:20:55   
short-term, some of the long-term, some of the in-depth, like you have to vary up what's there. It's like you have to plan out strategically this campaign of   
2:21:03   
of my 10e campaign of education or whatever. And as a student, it's like, well, maybe if you're a really good   
2:21:09   
student, you think about it that way too, more so, but for me at times it was mostly like, all right, what do I got to   
2:21:15   
do now? Oh, I got two more days, you know, you put it off and that kind of stuff. And   
2:21:21   
so it's very different when you're trying to structure these time boxes for   
2:21:26   
stuff, but what you're getting at is iteration like the demo or dice that we   
2:21:32   
talked about or at least the the the nature of like how do you create a meaningful time period for intake,   
2:21:39   
study, processing, and then create a situation for them to give something back to you. And yeah, even   
2:21:44   
acknowledging that it maybe isn't going to be this masterpiece final product refined paper output, that's great, but   
2:21:52   
pedagogically you're trying to get this iterative process just so they do it. Like you have you this is why it always   
2:21:59   
seems to come back to me just some form of building. Like that's my favorite word lately, but like you have to construct something   
2:22:06   
and and I think I I know we we've talked about it in a lab all the time and I would say all the time, oh well blog   
2:22:12   
post presentation, the importance of this and that, the importance of everything else, the importance of doing   
2:22:18   
it regularly presenting your ideas, all this stuff. But it has a different layer of meaning to me now even which is really like   
2:22:26   
how do you meaningfully iterate? You know what I mean? Yeah.   
2:22:32   
All right, that's great. Um, why don't we uh leave it there and um yeah, I'm   
2:22:40   
interested to hear maybe you can put a blog post together on that. That'd be great. Yes. Um, for for next week, what I would   
2:22:47   
like to do um and even I might even just be working on this later today because I   
2:22:53   
finally have time. I finally don't have like this head super like like cognitively distorting.   
2:23:02   
Um for next week I would like to present sort of I don't know about one pager but   
2:23:09   
but I would like to present what is the currently named futures future study   
2:23:15   
center or future center or something um and I want to identify the key points. I want to talk about alternatives,   
2:23:21   
destination based research, uh descriptive procru evaluatory,   
2:23:27   
um on-ramps, alternatives like those those I have the sort of glossery in the structure what I'm trying to do.   
2:23:33   
I'd like to present that next week. Um and a few other things, but that's sort of my goal. Um and maybe also if I had   
2:23:40   
more time today, maybe the interdisiplinary um research presentation, but at least some of that   
2:23:46   
for next week. Okay. Oh yeah, we can do that next week. Okay. Um, thank you for this stuff and   
2:23:53   
and as usual, please share the links in the the chat. I want to go back that way. Thank you very much. All right.   
2:23:59   
Sounds good. Thanks. Talk to you later. Bye.

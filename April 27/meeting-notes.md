## NOTES
Agile (and Scrum) versus RSE (Research software Engineering).

Slack (Searchable, but less functional the more you use it.

* tendencies carry over from platform to platform. Acquired uselessness.

* 20 minute limit to checking e-mails.


ISO9000 process (this process in workflows).

* Yannick Kilcher -- Devin (AI Software Devs).

* introduced a lot of bugs, then recognized them.

* big week in Neurotech -- G*tech -- based in Austria.


Christof Guger -- talks reflect full spectrum (on YouTube).

* Horse ERP. Equine auditory (non-human primate) ERP.


Tech companies, businesses "Silicon Heartland". Michigan, Indiana, Illinois.

* investments, but is the culture right for success?

* capture talent, capital, change the culture.

Big Five traits: seeing people in different regions having different traits.

* reminiscent national character studies.

* OREL --> look @ Midwest as an opportunity.

* Combine Harmony thread: Sander -- complex human disease. #brain-organoids.

* Tissue Forge, Prola: Psychomotor. Blood Flow triggers Cognitive Mechanisms.


Google Docs for meetings (Notion, Otter.AI). Running log, bot.

* model cards --> Summer of Docs. Mdel cards in open-source meetings.

* combined input form Worm Conference.

* weird learning curve for group.

* scrape all previous YT videos. Burb + links (in RSS feeds).

* Google Meet transcribed.  


Overloaded with Conversations: resources and main points.

* blurb --> segment --> information (annotation).

* critical mass of interest. Things that get buried in Slack, processes get abandoned (what are the incentives).

* is it more than that. Automation Services transcription, video segmentation.

* what do articles say, quality in tool spaces?


Ethical Consideration of AI-assisted Closed-loop Neurostimulation.

* motor control, speech, controller, encoder.

* notes right now, review of literature -- find the niche.

* posing Qs: what are the open issues, concerns?


Neuroethics links in the NeuroTechX Slack.

* non-invasive brain stimulation (Psychiatry, Neurodegeneration).

* data-driven approach.


Galaxy -- distro, globus user. Genomics pipeline (data-intensive biomedical research).

* Galaxy outside of Bioinformatics (Bioconductor, etc).

* theme: Neurodesk, multidistro platform. Tools from CERN. Brain initiative goals -- difficult get on laptop.

* M2D2 Slack -- MILA Bioinformatics -- Ben Blasik from Argonne. MatSci, data platform.

* using national labs material measurement databases.


Hackathon -- ML/AI tools with large data. Synthesize and sort through.

* lessons from fusion, DeepMind.


NWB -- what would we like to do moving forward? In-person physical hackathons.

* resume, CV-worthy. Recognition, validation. Accountability for follow-up -- accomplishing next steps.

* monetary --> $2k bounty (funding, logistics).

* huddle, small group --> easier to enforce. Sign up, show up, do things.

* if everything is free, people don't value it.


Global Hackathon -- avoid half-done projects. One larger projects together. John Griffiths.

* spyglass -- reproducible, sharable pipelines. No borders, maintain Hackathons.

0:03     
hi I'm Starbucks Hi how are you I'm fine yeah I hope the background noise not too     
0:09     
much oh no I mean yeah just uh I'll just yeah yeah yeah just mute when you're not     
0:16     
talking I don't know who else is showing up today so let's see Jesse's in Oxford or he     
0:24     
went to Oxford he's doing a conference there so     
0:30     
but any anyways like I mentioned to you this this career path of a research software engineer RSC like it's really     
0:36     
interesting because Ben B were talking about it it's like like I told you it's a mix between being a data scientist a scientist and a sof engineer yeah which     
0:44     
is kind of up the field of a lot of competitional scientists anyways but it's nice as this new career path like there new title for that um because a     
0:52     
lot of us we end up being like Jacks of all trades and like masters of n sort of     
0:58     
thing like my undergrad my undergrad research was in bionformatics yeah and my professor Matthew Hong     
1:05     
Dron he not not the best biologist and not the best computer scientist but you     
1:10     
know he was really good in biomatics like putting bringing things together so you know     
1:18     
yeah yeah yeah it's always hard to kind of find     
1:23     
the combination of skills that yeah yeah I just think because like     
1:29     
like if you tell someone you're a software engineer but you're actually like doing science and scientific research that is that is pretty     
1:36     
different it's pretty different you know like most people assume oh softare engineer you you're students looking at places like Google and Microsoft and     
1:43     
it's like that's pretty different from what you know the Allen Institute and the Simons Foundation are doing in terms     
1:49     
of software so yeah yeah yeah yeah we talked about the research software     
1:55     
engineer position like last summer during the open source meeting     
2:01     
and uh but you know yeah we should revisit that a little bit because it's uh and I've had other people interested     
2:08     
in that as well because it's a nice kind of combination of skills like especially     
2:14     
with what your people learn here in this group you know you're doing say you do Google summer of code you learn some     
2:21     
research and a lot of people would be more interested in research coming through this group and then putting that     
2:27     
together and it's definitely needed a need skill because there's a lot of software that I mean you know aside from     
2:34     
all the academic software that needs like people to have like a a way to make     
2:39     
it like not die every two years um you know having this sort of research     
2:46     
approach to software bu building software which is I think uh good if     
2:52     
you're have really complex systems like we do now yep yep yeah     
3:00     
yeah I don't like I I uh you know I teach project management and uh you know there's go     
3:07     
through all the stuff like agile and some of the other things and kind of get into some of these issues of like building software and how to do that the     
3:16     
process behind like managing a project and we talk a little bit about research but it's always been disconnected it's     
3:23     
like here's you know doing basic research or some sort of Applied research and then here's project     
3:29     
management and then they don't meet necessarily so I think people are using     
3:34     
like something like agile and although that's good for like rapid prototyping and stuff it's not good for like     
3:42     
maintenance necessarily it's not as good for maintenance so you know there's probably     
3:48     
a place for that to learn like people to learn that as a skill and apply     
3:54     
it it's definitely different yeah I mean I've seen I've seen a lot of organizations like say going to do Agile     
4:01     
yeah um but like not not like really really implemented you know     
4:08     
so uh you know and it's like I I feel I feel like like we we we get together for     
4:13     
like AG meetings scub meetings and we get together we Sprint we we AB like like nose nose on the concrete like     
4:19     
really really grinding ourselves but then we kind of just stopped that it's just like what wait what was what was the point of that you     
4:24     
wanted us to be in grind time we could have done that anyway so um yeah yeah     
4:31     
yeah I'll have to yeah I'll have to think about that I really want to move away from     
4:38     
slack in general yeah despite the fact that it it okay it is still relatively     
4:43     
like professional and formal it really does not have great functionality Discord is just so much better but     
4:49     
Discord is not the most formal it's it's Discord um there need why can't there be     
4:55     
something like a balance really efficient effective communication it's still rela form and professional like slack is cumbersome it's um like people     
5:04     
the the chat the chat style in slack is just not ideal for um like keeping up     
5:09     
with this you have to be you have to be like paying attention to the present the recent messages if you miss stuff it's     
5:15     
really hard to go back and slack so yeah well yeah the whole reasoning is slack is that you can it's     
5:22     
searchable like it's supposed to like email you would go into an email thread and never find what you're looking for     
5:28     
because everything's kind of in yeah think slack was supposed to be like you know spend less time in email for     
5:34     
quick communication and more time in slack yeah but now we're just moving over to slack as our you know hours and hours and slack every day thing too so     
5:41     
yeah yeah it gets like this uh it's an overwhelming thing yeah we talk about that like in project management and it's     
5:49     
it's an interesting conversation because it's like you know we use these tools to     
5:54     
sort of make our work better easier and then you get to the point where or it     
6:00     
doesn't and you have to invent something else and you keep doing that because email was supposed to make like     
6:05     
correspondence like better I mean you know it was like electronic but the way the emails was designed the clients they     
6:13     
were to make it you know things better make things like take you know take paper and not use paper make everything     
6:19     
digital but then people are like well this isn't really usable so let's create slack then they created like slack and     
6:26     
then it became unusable and now if we invent something else that'll become unusable and so on and so forth     
6:34     
so I you know maybe we'll hit upon the solution but I think I don't know if     
6:40     
it's because new problems get introduced with new systems or whether people just     
6:46     
kind of change their preferences I I feel like like psychologically no matter what new     
6:52     
platform or New Media or communication thing you'll introduce whether it's you know you know even we we text message     
6:58     
you know we want to make a group message just text to SMS text messages like people's personal habits and their     
7:04     
preferences for however they communicate their Styles and tendencies will carry over from one place to another you know     
7:10     
like if I have difficulty prioritizing tasks it's not going to really matter if I'm using email or slack I'm still going     
7:16     
to struggle with that on some way so um like at the very least like this idea     
7:23     
of reducing that like communication platform to as minimal as possible I'm I completely appreciate that and respect     
7:29     
that but at the same time approaching that like as a problem in and of itself just doesn't feel so ideal it seems like     
7:35     
it's in human nature so it's more like a psychological thing you know like you need to train yourself like all right     
7:41     
husin you've spent uh 20 minutes checking emails it seems like that's enough for today if you didn't get to     
7:46     
something then like you know see if you can rep prioritize it you know respectful yeah     
7:53     
yeah it's it's uh I'm loving this this conversation and um you know even though     
8:00     
I do find it somewhat triggering as I um my my experience in software engineering     
8:05     
was doing medical device development right so that's under ISO 9000 process     
8:12     
and you know yeah is is is a lot of paperwork but but     
8:19     
interesting who's the YouTuber Yanik culture culture yeah um yeah yeah     
8:26     
yeah anyway so his uh his topic of one of his topics today was um     
8:33     
is it delin the the software you know the AI software developer Deon yeah yeah     
8:41     
two there's one there's one made by uh Americans called Devon and there's oneor     
8:47     
there's one in India okay called he was he was talking     
8:53     
about de and and um some some videos of Devon and and so one     
9:02     
like I think it was put out by the company but anyway it was like Devon     
9:07     
doing tasks sorry I'm gonna capure um Devon doing tasks and um and then there     
9:13     
was questions about the edits like one like Devin did some software engineering     
9:18     
tests from upwork uh uh but like two criticisms one     
9:24     
that like they edited out that the person that you know de had actually worked on this for days     
9:29     
and two that Devon actually introduced a whole bunch of bugs in the software development and then and then     
9:36     
immediately recognized that and then was just like oh I see your project has some software bugs let me work on     
9:45     
this anyway it was an interesting U it was an interesting problem uh of yeah     
9:53     
like the agent not behaving as as intended I I'll I'll try and mute though     
10:00     
oh okay well no that's that's funny because uh I mean maybe that's what chat GP is doing except it doesn't tell     
10:07     
you it produces a bunch of Errors well you have to correct it that's that's     
10:13     
maybe a job for another bar uh yeah that's that's interest an     
10:19     
interesting conversation um oh yeah yeah no problem     
10:25     
yeah we've uh Starbucks and a cafeteria uh yeah represented today so that's good     
10:33     
um so yeah welcome to the meeting uh yeah that's good that's here you go um     
10:42     
so yeah I think Jesse is in Oxford you mentioned I think you mentioned maybe     
10:47     
last week that the plot Twisters people have their conference it's a game     
10:53     
developers conference or something where they're presenting so good luck to okay I'm jealous yeah I know it's a great     
11:01     
time of year to be there yeah so they're they're doing some things there um and uh Google summer of     
11:10     
code the selections are this week so I don't know who how many slots we'll get     
11:15     
who's going to be the person people who we get uh but that'll be coming up this     
11:21     
week so if you're looking forward to that uh news will be coming soon and     
11:28     
then you know once we get the selections made uh you'll get if you're selected you'll get an invite     
11:34     
email and we'll have we'll start off with the community period so next week at this time we'll be in the Google     
11:42     
summer of code Community period so that means that we'll be doing more tailored uh activities Rel uh relative to that     
11:50     
sort of thing so you know probably open talking about open source talking a     
11:55     
little bit about the lab education uh those sorts of things so I want to     
12:01     
spend some time on that but we'll also try to start up our Friday meetings I don't know about next week but maybe the     
12:07     
week after where we do um we usually get all the people involved in Google summer code Jesse and myself and Morgan often     
12:16     
attends uh you know we'll do um like a weekly check-in and then we'll do to     
12:23     
special topics so that's where're talking about research uh software engineering originally     
12:29     
last year and we didn't we just talked about it once we didn't do much more than that so we might actually do a     
12:35     
little bit more discussion on it this year um so people are welcome to attend     
12:41     
that meeting uh it's really you know updates for people do actively doing     
12:46     
projects if people are doing open S interested in doing open source stuff aside from that they're welcome to     
12:52     
attend and then you know for people who applied Google summer of code if you didn't get selected if you know I don't     
13:00     
know how many like I said I don't know how many slots we're going to get but if you didn't get selected you might still     
13:05     
want to pursue your project over the summer and we often do this uh make this     
13:10     
possible for people where you can work on a project over the summer with our group and you know maybe you use that     
13:17     
for some other purpose you might use it for next year's Google summer code or you might use it for you know people     
13:24     
usually do a bit of uh like work on the projects setting them up and and getting     
13:29     
some results so I don't you know I like to try to make sure that people don't waste their time on that and they can     
13:35     
actually do something uh productive so those are all things that we can do this     
13:41     
summer um so we're starting to ramp up on that schedule okay yeah good luck uh at the     
13:49     
hospital that we Virginia okay so all right um so I we had kind of an     
14:00     
informal discussion here about project management and uh re uh research     
14:05     
software engineering and agile always a good     
14:11     
conversation but yeah so I don't know if we had any     
14:16     
updates like I don't think anyone has     
14:22     
uh does anyone have any updates they'd like to share     
14:30     
so it's a big week in Nur Tech or at least     
14:37     
um kind of EEG electr Fizz um with the Gtech uh BCI     
14:46     
spring school um everybody should check that out it's a free to     
14:51     
register um you know the talks are Vienna time gex based in Austria uh so     
14:59     
they start at like you know one in the morning     
15:06     
but you know they're all on YouTube as well and I'm hoping Kristoff will break     
15:14     
the Kristof gger is the CEO and is the     
15:19     
the host um and you know their company I think I've talked about them before you     
15:24     
know their company does not only EEG devices um but but makes like the electr     
15:32     
fiz for you know EOG and you know surgical planning um and you know animal work um     
15:42     
stroke Rehabilitation you know they they really do kind of face all all aspects     
15:50     
of of you know um electr his work and um     
15:56     
the talks really reflect that that full spectrum of of kind of interests and     
16:01     
research that is really interesting and the the Highlight for me was and again I     
16:08     
I've been doing this 30 years uh I've never seen a horse go through um an Erp     
16:17     
study a horse yeah so like yes yes you did hear that     
16:26     
correctly and I think I said something like like you know I was I was talking uh to a particular group of designers     
16:34     
and I I was talking about one of the speakers and I was just like yes you know he just spoke after you know he     
16:42     
just spoke after the horse and I was like I never thought I would write that um but uh but there we go um yeah yeah     
16:52     
so and it's interesting because it's similar they have similar issues that you have with non-human primates where     
17:00     
sometimes the skull is such that the skull actually keeps you or you know the head to to where you're going to place     
17:06     
the electrodes actually keeps you like a very large distance from the brain     
17:12     
itself um uh so anyway there there were issues yeah came     
17:20     
up uh but like they ran them it they ran the horse uh it was an eoin auditory Erp     
17:28     
study okay and um and I can say that that is it first     
17:35     
um but but lots lots of great talks and     
17:41     
um anyway let me let me also check some notes because I think there were some other conferences and talks this week     
17:49     
that would be of interest to right I need to be reminded here yeah um yeah     
17:55     
that that's great and you know I think like now we don't have to search uh an     
18:01     
image generator for like a picture of a horse with a cap     
18:07     
on we have a picture maybe so     
18:13     
um yeah um yeah so that's great uh thanks for the update U well we'll talk     
18:19     
about like some events in a little bit here um and so yeah we had a couple     
18:25     
meetings this week we had uh worm of course um and then we had uh cognition     
18:34     
Futures we brought that back uh I think Jesse took some time off from that for a     
18:39     
couple weeks but we're back in the swing of things um got we got sort of got introduced to     
18:47     
a new paper we were talking about eruption Theory uh and then Thursday we did the     
18:53     
cybernics meeting uh where we talked about another paper and so um the the     
19:01     
um can't remember what it was now uh but yeah we did another paper     
19:09     
anticipatory systems yes yes we did a overview of anticipatory systems uh     
19:14     
where you know we kind of walk through what it what they are and uh you know so     
19:20     
that's that's interesting it's always like it's a it's kind of a I don't want to say cottage industry but it's an area     
19:28     
where people oh talk about it a lot but there're only a handful of references     
19:33     
that really get into it so people are working out examples so that's that's I think useful     
19:41     
especially in light of we've been talking about the over regulator theorem in cybernetics and there are a lot of     
19:47     
parallels or contrasts to that so that's what we went     
19:53     
over so that's great um okay did we have any other     
20:02     
updates so um I just wanted to mention like um yeah I appreciate all this this     
20:08     
been some great discussion I think um you know one thing I've noticed and one thing I've been talking about people     
20:13     
here in Indiana like for me in the midwest is that um there's been talk about uh a lot of tech companies and     
20:21     
businesses investing a lot and um creating like in Tech like a     
20:26     
technological innovation Hub here in the Midwest and some people now referring to this area as silicon Heartland and people     
20:33     
have been like writing and Publishing books about this like kind of you know you talk about technology in America no     
20:39     
one really thinks about Indiana Illinois Illinois Ohio Michigan or if they do they think about like really     
20:45     
decentralized like data centers like maybe like the Amazon centers here in     
20:50     
some parts of the Midwest or some parts in Ohio and Illinois they don't think so much of like say like you know obviously     
20:56     
we don't this isn't Silicon Valley this is just Indiana okay but in recent years     
21:02     
there have been a lot of efforts put forward by companies in businesses including really big ones like Amazon     
21:08     
and like this uh South Korean ship maker SI HX to invest to invest here in the     
21:15     
Midwest turning the Rust Belt into the check belt and calling it the silic heart so I just wanted to share that in     
21:21     
some ways and um whatever happens happens to be     
21:27     
truthful like as much as people want to invest here like and you know like like the land     
21:33     
here is cheap the the tax rates are much lower so you might think it's really ideal for a business none of it is     
21:38     
really going to amount to anything unless things really uh you know     
21:44     
changeing the culture like changing the culture of people and what what's going on here in Indiana and the Midwest     
21:50     
especially okay yeah like legitimately like this place like like I I can share     
21:55     
with you a few articles that are describing what I'm uh what I was talking about     
22:03     
um excuse me [Music]     
22:11     
um you know I just wanted to share because it might it might be relevant to all you know based based Illinois like     
22:18     
here's this idea of the Silicon hard yeah um Amazon units investing here in     
22:25     
Indiana creating a thousand jobs yeah South Korean chipmaker sidx in     
22:34     
Indiana okay so that's what I'm talking about like ideally we've seen this happen before     
22:41     
I'm not trying to be like a naysayer like to be pessimistic or cynical but generally no matter like who comes here     
22:46     
to Indiana the Midwest especially IND like like Samsung stting um businesses     
22:52     
in tech centers here um I think like Honda have tried to do things too no     
22:57     
matter what they always relocate and people here in Indiana do not change and adapt as quickly as they need to     
23:03     
they just really don't okay like a lot of the social policy and     
23:08     
um like the the approaches towards money and economic spending here in indana are just not ideal for the type of growth     
23:15     
that these innov Innovative hubs and centers are looking for people here are still pretty risk ofers to change we     
23:21     
want to reinforce the status especially in the Midwest and um you know I just wanted to share this because it is interesting and     
23:27     
whatever happens happen and so I'm I'm still here in Indiana but my company I work for they're based over in     
23:33     
California so none of this actually applies to me um n if it applies to me but I am     
23:38     
looking for jobs and I'm including applying here in N Midwest um so that     
23:44     
would definitely include like say because because the job I work for in California my ideal position is to go     
23:49     
for them part-time and work full-time somewhere else so that's mine just right now I just wanted to share this because     
23:55     
this probably does affect like what oral is doing based here in you know you might think if you're thinking about virtual reality augment     
24:01     
reality research on cognition on the mind on the brain like aren't the top universities based in like California     
24:07     
like Berkeley even East Coast like uh Washington DC MIT like but no um we have     
24:13     
these Innovative uh like the idea of Indiana or the Midwest in particular     
24:19     
going from the Rust Belt to the uh to the tech belts you know whatever     
24:24     
whatever happens happens so yeah yeah so I mean that's a direct uh sort of     
24:30     
example from Champagne orbana which is where I'm located uh so that you know     
24:36     
the university here is well known for like creating a lot of technology and having very strong technology presence     
24:44     
and in fact there have been a number of companies that have gone very you know been become very big things based on the     
24:51     
technology from the University so like you know a Netscape and that's whole     
24:57     
thing that was sort of based in champagne or bana there were all sorts of technology and some patents going on     
25:04     
at the University that ended up becoming big concerns and you know there is like     
25:10     
a lot of tech around Chicago like with Motorola and other companies that where     
25:15     
they have Investments and you know there's this kind of interchange a lot of people come from suburban Chicago and     
25:22     
they go to school here and then they become you know pretty big deals in Tech     
25:29     
and so it's interesting there's a lot of stuff that start started at the University and then became big and then     
25:35     
the big when they become big they're usually in Silicon Valley and so you     
25:41     
know there is this aspect of like how do you capture that and keep it you know in     
25:46     
the community or at least in the region and so you know um there is a A Research     
25:52     
Park here and it's growing pretty at a pretty good clip but it's you know a lot of it is um you know it's companies from     
26:00     
the outside who want to like put an office here to get people to kind of capture that Talent so you have Yahoo     
26:08     
and you have rivan and some other companies that are you know doing things um but they're not you know it's not     
26:15     
like a Hu they're not huge uh homegrown things often they're kind of like other     
26:21     
you know bigger companies that want to tap into that Talent stream um and then you know you have     
26:27     
this issue of funding or money so like a lot of the money is like kind of biased towards the east and west coasts     
26:34     
universities in the midwest get money from the federal government but it's like the Venture Capital the stuff that     
26:40     
you need to have like these to scale up to the big companies those aren't really     
26:46     
you know that that's they don't really look upon the Midwest as like a place where you know they can they can fund     
26:52     
you know usually if you fund you go to I mean there there are many factors involved you know economic social even     
26:57     
cultural the Midwest like historically rooted in an agrarian society where people are from like the Midwest is     
27:04     
based on farming and agriculture people like communication Styles behaviors and cultures and approaches to the workplace     
27:10     
and their lives that were more risk averse more about the status quo like you know approach change with caution     
27:17     
rather than like you know Innovative like like different ways of thinking different ways of doing things     
27:23     
so you know like like this this this idea of like the Silicon heartline this is what I was referring to like say um     
27:29     
this book by Rebecca Rebecca F Rebecca F American Midwest was a proud Bastion of     
27:35     
good paying jobs and it's you know like like you know     
27:45     
um like like it is it is happening it is happening like this isn't just some like some pipe dream going on oh yeah like     
27:53     
but it's more so um I guess I guess it's more so um you     
27:58     
know like like how how much of I guess I guess what I what I would think about     
28:04     
too is how much of this is really going to change like the midwestern the midwestern culture as a whole or is it     
28:11     
more like the midwestern culture being embraced in a very strong technologically Innovative approach to     
28:16     
your science and sex like that so whatever happens happens well I think yeah yeah well I think it's going to be     
28:22     
like and it is that way now where you have certain communities where it's very it's embracing very strongly and others     
28:29     
where it is so like you have a university or like a suburb where     
28:34     
there's like a a big company you know you might be and this holds true for biotech as well where you have a large     
28:41     
company uh like a lot of pharmaceutical companies where you know they they have a presence and that Community has like a     
28:48     
very strong Embrace of that and then you go down the road 20 miles and there's this community that's not embracing it     
28:55     
at all because they don't have the resources there in the ground so yeah I     
29:00     
think it's going to be like and but that's true of Silicon Valley too if you go there you know you have different     
29:05     
parts of Northern California yeah it's it's still like you know um you know     
29:11     
like I guess I I I appreciate that like that's all um you know like it's it's     
29:17     
just it's just a shame but like what used to defate the Midwest and other parts of America has you know really     
29:23     
really really been overtaken by those other parts of America like even here in Tiana like thinking about the cities     
29:29     
that have lost their manufacturing jobs in the automobile industry in similar areas like they've all moved out of Indiana you know over the past Century     
29:35     
of course people understand historically um I guess like um you know like yeah     
29:42     
like like what whatever happens happens wherever this wherever this goes um and     
29:48     
uh you know like this uh I I think I think it's also wise to see this in in     
29:54     
light of America's um like now excuse me um like America and a lot     
30:03     
of other countries not so much prioritizing globalization like we want we want things here we want things at     
30:08     
home we want to do things within our borders which many countries have taken since the pandemic we can't afford to     
30:15     
risk you know lack of opportunity now that the pandemic has shaken things up I     
30:20     
mean even for me to go up and do my PhD in Canada and then the pandemic happens that was really tough for me even just     
30:25     
between US and Canada but like um this idea of like um you     
30:32     
know like like it do it does change things at least with the way I view like     
30:38     
where I want to work and where and who you want to network out to and reach out to that if we can really convince the     
30:44     
world that the Midwest can be creative original Innovative we can push forward new ideas the same way other states of     
30:52     
California and Texas can that would really put a lot of other stuff um for us on the map so     
30:58     
yeah for the most part for the most part when I saw people out from Indiana they they don't really they don't really see     
31:04     
things that way so yeah yeah well so one let me just say I still     
31:11     
think that Indiana University has some of the best toal in the United States     
31:17     
right now like you know I mean yeah anyway and in particular in some of the     
31:23     
topics that we discuss uh regularly certainly Diva worm meeting uh uh this     
31:30     
week was was basically covering James Glazer's virtual tissue or you know um     
31:36     
um tissue Forge and you know related related tools uh but you know     
31:46     
great discussion because you know I'm here in my hometown and um as I was     
31:52     
driving in um this is Virginia's technology corridor     
31:58     
um but I am in you know the southern part the Southwest part of the state so     
32:04     
this is Appalachia and um uh you know my my hometown um     
32:12     
probably you know had its its peak in the 1920s as a railroad town you know     
32:19     
and um and it's been trying to find itself ever since in terms of     
32:27     
what industries you know um it can characterize itself with and but we also     
32:34     
have Virginia Tech here right so sometimes they talk about the Rono     
32:40     
blackburg region and that's Bas I think just to include     
32:46     
Foria uh because again it's it is a source of funds for the state but um but     
32:52     
yeah those those are very unevenly distributed you know I mean it's it's how much does that get outside of the     
32:58     
University itself and um and help the community you know um     
33:04     
so like I I love this topic because it's near and dear to my heart in terms of um     
33:10     
how to use you know what I see in San Francisco and and it's it's     
33:20     
somewhat you know the effect it has in terms of kind of sucking all the oxygen out of a room and or you know sucking     
33:28     
all the dollars into it into its coffers uh and you know how much that gets back     
33:35     
you know um and you know I'm here at the hospital which I would say has now     
33:41     
become you know the number one industry of of Rona like like it is the medical     
33:48     
Hub of this region of the country and um you know to some degree that's that's     
33:55     
that's great because it's a growth industry you know uh um     
34:01     
and you know there's some agglomeration effects in terms of you know like I     
34:06     
think it'll continue to receive more funding to become a bigger Hub because     
34:14     
you know because of all the history here with with the medical centers so I'm     
34:19     
trying to look at um yeah what what what's the balance there between you     
34:25     
know the the obvious talent that Tech has um in you know in the kind of the     
34:35     
the local industry which is the hospital in terms of what yeah what's what's the Synergy there so I love this     
34:43     
topic believe me like technology stem math science you know medicine even Medical Technology bringing that to the     
34:50     
Midwest there'll still be large draws for that but basically still to many other things like like game industry     
34:57     
video Gam development good luck getting that getting that started in the midwest you know we're not we're not going invest stuff like that so it really     
35:03     
depends um on things but like um it's really hard to you know I mean I     
35:09     
certainly understand how like hard it is to keep you know it's like as soon as soon as any Talent gets identified here     
35:17     
you know it's very quickly I would say you know poached to to another region     
35:23     
yeah yeah for sure you know like I I get it I get it     
35:29     
you know sometimes in Indiana I totally feel like we almost just like Gaslight ourselves into not wanting to get better     
35:36     
not wanting to innovate not wanting to grow because people here are afraid of us just like leaving and getting away from us like you know it it is what it     
35:44     
is I posted in the chat about Personality yeah you have to look at the Big Five personality traes whether or     
35:49     
not you believe Big Five personality scientifically valid I'm not going to get into that right now but like um at     
35:55     
least it it has some some some relevance like in like scientifically empirically     
36:01     
empirical context but that's like these high personality traits agreeableness consensuous openness neuroticism and     
36:07     
extroversion midwesterners and they actually do vary from state to state from region to region it is shown that     
36:13     
people across different states have different big five traits so agreeableness and consens are very high     
36:18     
in the midwest but they're low on openness uh people they're very nice     
36:24     
friendly hardworking people they'll treat you well they'll be kind with man and their attitude towards life the     
36:30     
truth is people here aren't they're not open to new ideas they they're very risk     
36:37     
it's all about the status quo here so that's what I'm thinking about when it's like how you know how much can we change     
36:44     
in terms of like calling ourselves like a silicon Heartland like is that actually going to change the culture that personality     
36:51     
that's what I'm thinking about and you know you can't change a culture you can innovate you can invest but you can't change a culture of a region so     
36:58     
yeah I know from personal experience many people I've worked here like in IU     
37:04     
in Indiana University maybe but especially when I worked at Purdue okay     
37:09     
like they are so risk averse they're hardworking amazing University top tier     
37:14     
Talent like Nobel prizes you know like publication quality research op prod do     
37:20     
is top tier they have great deflation you know they they hold themselves to really high standards but um it's more     
37:27     
about the the status quo so that's just some stuff I wanted to share in terms of how this relates to oral to the orthop research education mod I do think it'll     
37:34     
be wise to at least look at the Midwest in light of these new advancements of how we can see this area as a silic     
37:39     
apartment you know not just cor not just the rust belts but legitimately these these states Indiana Ohio     
37:45     
Illinois as um you know uh you know as Tech as legitimate Tech     
37:52     
hubs Innovation centers so where we can go with that so yeah     
37:58     
yeah I think that's an interesting conversation so there a couple themes here one is that you know this kind of     
38:05     
is sort of reminiscent of the national character studies that they did in the mid 20th century where they said you     
38:12     
know they certain cultures have certain personality traits or that cultures kind     
38:17     
of influence how people in general you know their their sort of traits so     
38:24     
they're you can go back in the social science literature and read about that and some of it is you know stereotypical     
38:31     
but other other you know parts of it are like back in the 1980s when the United     
38:37     
States uh in Japan you know there was a lot of uh the Japanese were buying a lot     
38:42     
of real estate in the US and uh that you know there was this idea that the Japanese or the Eastern mind was a     
38:49     
certain way and it you know it's it it aged you know the way you would expect it to age but I mean no I think there's     
38:56     
some value in like thinking about how cultural you know there's like this     
39:01     
connection between the influences of culture in a certain place and how people sort of approach things yeah I     
39:08     
mean like like I know and and not only that but like specific mannerisms like mid westers being low in openness like     
39:15     
we're very non-confrontational people that avoid we avoid arguments and stuff like that so you know we don't get that     
39:22     
flourishing or flowing of new ideas new clashes and like people that have differences we to just keep to ourselves     
39:28     
and avoid you know difficult issues and difficult conversations here at indana and the Midwest so yeah and once again     
39:36     
with respect to oral toal research and education lab you know we continue to     
39:41     
innovate we continue to put out papers and things and uh you know push forward with projects like Diva worm and     
39:47     
openworm like whatever everything else we're doing like seeing that in light of these growing trends of the Midwest of     
39:53     
the Silicon Heartland I think that'd be really cool to see how how things go so     
39:59     
yeah yeah yeah yeah the other theme Here is if you know anything about the work     
40:04     
of a manual wallerstein and that was again back in the mid 20th century there was this idea of world systems theory     
40:12     
where you have like you know different systems where you have hubs of activity     
40:18     
you know sometimes it's like the core of economic activity and then the periphery of economic activity so like in in while     
40:27     
ste's model you know you would have like a core which in this case would relate to like something like Silicon Valley or     
40:34     
some of the major Tech hubs and then the periphery which are places where they were on the outlying areas I mean you     
40:40     
could explain you know National development that way you could explain colonialism that way and so on and so     
40:48     
forth so it's it's you know it's kind of a p a idea I mean it's it's carried on in other theories but it's it's a     
40:55     
general you know kind of approach to that where you have this model of you know there's a place where there's a lot     
41:02     
of attention and investment and then there these other things going on that maybe you don't get as much attention     
41:08     
but they're still kind of active just kind of at the periphery of of of things     
41:13     
and so yeah I mean as I think especially that's especially you can see that when you look at like how Talent gets poached     
41:21     
so if you become too big of a fish in that peripheral Pond you get poached to the big the big leagues as it were and     
41:29     
that that can inhibit a lot of this kind of uh growth of these of these uh     
41:34     
peripheral regions and you know it's it's the system of sort of um you know hierarchical system of     
41:42     
sort of attention or a funding and you know it's hard to change that I guess is the is the point is that once you have     
41:49     
that system established it's you know hard to equalize that although you know     
41:55     
it's if there was a lot I think if there was a lot of attention paid to it you might be able to improve the     
42:01     
situation that's what you know Federal funding is all about or supposed to be all about is where you kind of fund     
42:08     
universities if if they're you know the Midwest of course has a lot of good     
42:13     
universities tracks a lot of international um talent and so you know     
42:19     
but again that's like there's a funding disparity with you know respect to like     
42:24     
MIT and then like maybe a place like um you know another you know a     
42:30     
Midwestern University so it it's it's interesting how that all plays out um     
42:36     
now Jesse said in the chat here he said Upstate New York Dan Elton and I tried     
42:41     
to get the tech Valley New York space going but we both ended up leaving the area so that's like again Jesse went to     
42:49     
the core which is Boston or core instead of staying in yeah there's like a lot a     
42:56     
lot like that and I'm sure we want R other things but     
43:01     
like now that I've kind of been in Boston and seen the transition and sort     
43:08     
of the vacuum and the poaching and the like all these events I'm going to     
43:14     
based are MIT Associated but like it's it's very clear like it's it's     
43:21     
part MIT and part just like this is the subtext in the banner     
43:26     
of like Ai and Tech development it's like this is it's it's not like MIT is everywhere     
43:34     
even though it is uh which is really which is kind of like it makes you think a little bit about like the institution     
43:41     
uh as it as it was portrayed in like Fallout 4 like oh then it's everywhere     
43:46     
um you know but it's like it's weird that I think I'm just I haven't lived in like a center of gravity until moving to     
43:55     
Boston even my first Fusion like doing a lot there so seeing it living in it is     
44:02     
different a lot of interesting stories um everything we've been saying Morgan     
44:08     
brother same too so yeah um yeah I was just I was that was that was a personal     
44:15     
anecdote for the it it was it was really tough     
44:20     
because um you upstate New York has a lot going on too but there's also this     
44:25     
very particular drift and there are many opportunities like IBM was it going to do something there was was all these     
44:31     
different companies going to develop something there or in Massachusetts you know and and New York City is not far     
44:37     
away from all new Upstate New York either but it's a different kind of Hub with a different it's almost like trade     
44:43     
wins of sorts just pushing things in directions um and then yeah World System     
44:49     
stuff so also hi from I'm in England today so yeah yeah hello R and Sara     
44:59     
welcome yeah yeah so that was a great conversation um I'd like to move on to     
45:05     
some other things but if you're interested in continuing this this going be a good thing to think about I know we     
45:10     
don't talk too much about like things like this but I think it's important because um you know it does explain a     
45:17     
lot about how technology gets developed and ultimately like with respect to AI     
45:23     
ethics and things like that where you know you have people developing technologies that are kind of you know     
45:30     
separated from the communities that are using them so it's uh it's important to     
45:36     
think that way and yeah so okay um I     
45:42     
think I'll well I was just gonna talk about um     
45:50     
something that was also going on this week but more in the computational systems biology that um to kind of keep     
45:57     
a thread going on the combin harmony stuff oh yeah so you know welcome I I     
46:06     
think it's like um welcome sander the s n g r anyway never heard it pronounced     
46:13     
um but uh in Hixon there they're doing computational systems biology for     
46:19     
complex human disease from static Dynamic representations of disease me     
46:25     
mechanisms um anyway it looked great uh I wish I     
46:30     
could have been there um trying to I dropped links in brain organoids     
46:38     
okay um and uh yeah just uh     
46:46     
uh would love to yeah make sure we we keep that theme going in terms of tissue     
46:53     
Forge comp you know computational systems biology and yeah the tools and     
46:59     
tools and techniques yeah so like this week's Diva worm meeting we talked about uh tissue     
47:05     
Forge we went over that's an open source package that where you can model uh cells as like uh sheets of cells and and     
47:13     
tissues so they have it's it's it's nice because they have a lot of tools that     
47:19     
you would otherwise have to go to many different packages and sort of integrate so you know they have every there     
47:24     
there's a physics to that to the models and you can run different types of     
47:30     
models you can run like molecular models cellular models and they have like a lot of different physics that you can     
47:36     
simulate in there so um but we go over that in the deal meeting and then we talked about combine Harmony which of     
47:42     
course paa presented her talk on on cards ml cards and then this is paa's     
47:50     
update here in the chat an update for me uh paa Deo uh then this is 2020 24     
47:57     
non-invasive neuromodulation to stimulate reduce blood flow mitigate cognitive decline in psychomotor     
48:04     
conditions yes she's got words thank you thank you so much for reading it out I     
48:11     
just say hi to everyone and hello especially to the people who I haven't met yet like St for the first time and     
48:19     
Sarah and I think and so this particular paper is just the note it's suppos to     
48:26     
that was accepted at the Mich forgot it was accepted as a poster     
48:35     
at the neoscience conference my God my decline my do     
48:41     
declin anyway sowhere then I was hoping that I could find a good     
48:48     
presenter and uh so someone go phally was some     
48:57     
I'm so used to do virtual presentation as s that I present virtually and they said no you have to be here and then it     
49:04     
turned out like so I it's kind of withdrawn but it     
49:10     
was accepted so it's good and this paper you can take a quick look it's nothing     
49:16     
too major but um sorry are you asking me     
49:22     
question oh sorry where where did you say it's the the conferences     
49:27     
I can okay sorry sorry okay Minnesota     
49:32     
neurom modulation Society in the States was my first to the     
49:38     
slack we have a slack because it's midnight here and I was kind of have asleep when I remember oh I do have a     
49:45     
date on Saturday night with a bunch of people so I I woke up but have sleep so     
49:51     
and this um it's the first post that I had talk was saying hey got EXA so     
49:58     
somewhere in and um Minnesota     
50:04     
Minesota neural modulation there a medical devices comp yeah and it's a     
50:09     
great spot if you submit if you submit poster you get a free admission for the     
50:15     
conference so I thought I'd try and the poster obviously was like because it's very tough it's something I've been     
50:22     
working a lot on um in terms of I because     
50:27     
I have realized that we all have cognition issues with parents that the decline and there's this this cognitive     
50:35     
decline has been uh very much of my concern and I have understood something     
50:42     
which I explained in the paper um and I had this hypothesis that blood flow     
50:50     
thought trigger certain important cognitive mechanism and so so what I did I didn't     
50:57     
do any primary research but I started searching for evidence in the literature     
51:03     
and I said is there evidence that blood flow in the brain s blood triggers     
51:09     
important mechanism for cognition but also for motor uh ability so psycho     
51:16     
motor and and then it turns out that there is quite a lot of evidence to show     
51:21     
that that is the case so uh of I a     
51:26     
hybrid interdisplinary person kind of practition and a very     
51:32     
pragmatic person what I do that you know especially in the case of my parents or     
51:37     
myself or other people that I know I start said okay how can they increase     
51:43     
blood flow to the brain noninvasively I do noninvasive neurom modulation and I'm started experimenting     
51:50     
the devices devices that you can actually the chip that you can buy your name every day Dev that is there     
51:58     
anything there and there are kind of bunch of devices from um which I been     
52:03     
talk to about give another presentation about that later it's a long story but anyway that is the um abstract which was     
52:11     
detected which I never got the chance discuss and what I want to say today very quickly     
52:16     
is that I am just starting to get a hang of lab I just figured out that ell is     
52:25     
not just survey because this Discerning and and then I started     
52:32     
realizing that we intersecting at different levels um and it's great and I     
52:38     
want to make the most of this and Morgan I dropped out of your of with the computation of psychiat Channel because     
52:46     
SL because it was too far out I am far out but that to but I'm still on the     
52:52     
brain organ Channel just you know see if I can help with that much and um and I have     
52:59     
actually uh started I made a comment on who paper say did you see the     
53:06     
paper yeah I I saw the comments y yeah I saw I saw the comments I I don't know it's valid comment but that's what the     
53:14     
only thing I started I felt we should prog that but if you disagree of course we can talk about time and and what I'm     
53:21     
thinking is because what I think I'm going to find most value uh is this     
53:26     
intersection I realize you have other meing going on and and is that there's a     
53:32     
lot of important information that people are facilitating and I wondered broadly     
53:38     
would it be useful or would it be a good idea uh to have a kind of mini Journal     
53:44     
of this to have because there's so much information and because we're struggling with the I am so would it be useful to     
53:52     
have some of useful resources that people are sharing on     
53:57     
journal and you don't have to answer now you mean like a like a u a customized     
54:04     
journal for the lab or for for this me I don't know for this meeting or for the lab rather than a     
54:11     
journal in the sense of publishing original papers yeah just a journal of what people are saying because there is     
54:17     
so much information a very fast pH yeah yeah chat difficult I was wondering     
54:24     
could we the collaborative create a a Google doc for each of these meetings     
54:30     
where we can D even slack is not working on I liit so would it be worth having a     
54:36     
bog dog where we can taste our stuff during the meetings for future reference     
54:42     
and this is just an idea and if you think it's a good idea I wouldn't mind starting it because then at least you     
54:48     
can always go back and then I wanted to say a couple of other things I've started like part conversations and then     
54:55     
Part I about what I wanted to say but um so yeah it would be great I see I I want     
55:02     
to ask aboutou things I don't know now the future you mentioned those ofos of     
55:08     
jasine and um I don't interface with Google code because I'm not a programmer     
55:15     
but of course I do the model cards and I I heard at some point with the fraction     
55:22     
of my brain that there is a Google summer of document yes yes there is and     
55:29     
that I can do and that is something I would like so just on the side so I don't do code although I I have occasion     
55:37     
get it's not my but documents are so let me know if there's any that     
55:44     
and um I oh yeah you said you were going to use this combined input for a a worm     
55:53     
conference or something would you mind giving any updat that just a few words if you have any and that's it for me     
56:02     
okay uh I'm not sure about that last point I don't know what that's in reference     
56:08     
to like the data     
56:14     
set worm worm oh     
56:19     
yeah on the slack you said that you were going to use the input some of the     
56:24     
inputs that I gave the in that I gave from this combine to to discuss it into the     
56:33     
worm dep or that remember what it was and I wonder if you have any follow yeah     
56:38     
yeah oh well what I was referring to is I discussed the uh that I discussed the     
56:44     
combine Harmony uh conference in this week's meeting so like deware meetings are kind     
56:51     
of like this meeting it's a special meeting it's shorter a little bit um and     
56:56     
and uh we talked about the proceedings of that meeting in in in Diva worm and     
57:02     
we we kind of went over it a little bit so that's that's all I was referring to     
57:07     
there thank you yeah and that's actually available on YouTube if you want to check out the overview of course you     
57:14     
were involved with it so I don't know how useful it is we didn't really get into that much depth but um we just kind     
57:21     
of talked about like biological modeling or generally and how you know the     
57:27     
different kinds of things that people are interested in um especially with     
57:33     
respect to that conference but one of your other points here was about model cards and Google summer of docs so there     
57:39     
is a Google summer of docs um but we don't it's it's a lot different than summer of code and we don't typically     
57:46     
participate in it it's a hard a little bit harder to do um because the projects     
57:52     
are um I don't know I've done it once and it wasn't quite the same as summer of code so I I     
57:59     
don't know if i' be interested in doing summer of docs at least now but what I     
58:05     
think would be interesting would be you know our open source meetings that we're going to have if we could talk more     
58:10     
about things like model cards um I don't know if you can make those meetings but like you know we we could definitely     
58:17     
have a you know a set of conversations about uh you know model auditing and and     
58:24     
things like that um and so I have usually for during the summer we have     
58:30     
our uh gck reports on projects weekly updates and then we have topics and that     
58:37     
might be one of the topics we cover for a couple weeks or something where we get into some of the details of that and     
58:43     
that might be interesting to kind of further that conversation or maybe     
58:49     
further some work on it um so that's that's something and then the Google     
58:54     
docs for meetings so we had Jesse has been very fastidious about having     
59:00     
a yeah having a notion for the meetings we haven't had one in a while but     
59:06     
usually what we do is have like a notion doc which is a it's not a Google doc     
59:11     
it's like uh better I guess than a Google doc and so Jesse you want to say     
59:16     
something about that well yeah um it's kind of funny because I think that drifted off that drifted off a little     
59:24     
before yeah how kind of became more regular here and it it Ed off for a few     
59:30     
reasons I mean I still I'm still up for doing it but I think     
59:36     
one um I'm noticing that a lot of people like it were basically only me     
59:42     
who would be going there and doing it and I think if we are going to I'm I think it's a great idea to have like a     
59:48     
running law just things things that are being shared but I think it would be better to have like a Google doc that's     
59:55     
a little more accessible to do so because just lowering the barers of friction to do it um and it could     
1:00:02     
be it could just just be like weekly or it could be sort of like you know     
1:00:11     
um like like it could just be a running agenda list to um I I I'm very open to     
1:00:18     
do it and I'm happy to even maintain it again um but I think it's more like     
1:00:28     
I I'm not sure I think it takes a critical mass     
1:00:34     
for it to be more than just some person scribbling notes that nobody looks at to be to be blunt in that sense but if     
1:00:41     
there's something there that people want to do like there's so much content like I totally I totally think that there's     
1:00:46     
ways to either have something or to um like I think the broader question is     
1:00:55     
people who come here like there's a there's a really weird learning curve because it's like we're we're     
1:01:03     
really doing oral stuff at seemly but     
1:01:08     
there's a lot of there's I feel like orthogonal Labs kind of almost a name and just at times     
1:01:14     
because we're we're like trying to find the connections we're trying to really you know uh do do you know ridiculously     
1:01:22     
interdisplinary stuff as as it was said some I guess so I think it's like what do we do with     
1:01:28     
that and I think having a shared document is a place to do it almost like     
1:01:34     
almost like you're going to a conference with friends or people and like yeah     
1:01:39     
let's just take a sh notes do let's just take all the notes together but that's like that's that's every     
1:01:45     
Saturday because you don't really know where it's for me guys if I correct you stting     
1:01:51     
to become like oh my gosh I can talk to people about that I'm interested in simp     
1:01:57     
that even if it's just a few minutes share L otherwise I struggle even in other     
1:02:04     
circumstances is if you work in there is always an agenda you really     
1:02:11     
to follow stly there something to down there no time for conversation here there conversation so me this is the     
1:02:19     
place where if I can from the like you know it's fine and so let     
1:02:26     
me suggest this just since you're at not today because I'm a little bit     
1:02:31     
slow tonight but um maybe as of next week um I will just I will start it or     
1:02:38     
you can start it a which simply says this day these people had and if everyone edit everyone     
1:02:47     
at the meting can D there whatever they think they want to share permanently     
1:02:52     
some chitchat maybe we don't need but maybe there is an important     
1:02:58     
Pap mention forget and then we keep it simp very     
1:03:05     
simple today's dat this is myut on this meeting and then let's see how it goes     
1:03:11     
and of course if it if it doesn't work about but I think I would find it useful     
1:03:17     
because there's so much going on lost a lot of references to other things on and     
1:03:23     
let's let's try that's yeah I I think it would be worth um you     
1:03:29     
know I I I haven't done this but I assume it would be easy to scrape all the uh all the previous YouTube videos     
1:03:37     
because um uh you know Bradley puts a     
1:03:42     
little blurb plus plus links to the papers that he covers uh with the with the YouTube um     
1:03:51     
and I just wanted to add that um I don't know what does on this but um you know     
1:03:59     
all our meetings in Google meets are um are actually     
1:04:04     
transcribed by an app so it's like we have a user we have a user on on for our     
1:04:14     
you know governance meetings of the bab and     
1:04:19     
things like that where it's like it's all I think it's otter that     
1:04:26     
yeah yeah yeah yeah so like otter sits in on our meetings then gives us a gives     
1:04:32     
us a transcription I I I do think you YouTube     
1:04:38     
produces I forget how it does it but like can you get YouTube to generate a     
1:04:44     
transcription yeah yes but I don't yeah well you can get like     
1:04:53     
captions yeah and anyway I mean just just as H just as or     
1:05:00     
you know my my my main comment was just like I would love to scrape the YouTube     
1:05:05     
videos and basically have Bradley's Bradley's blur plus the the links as     
1:05:13     
like a weekly blog post you know like like that that you know having that as     
1:05:19     
RSS feeds would be awesome yeah again I'm not trying to not     
1:05:25     
trying generate work for you Bradley like I would help well is AI supposed to be helpful     
1:05:32     
right yeah yeah that's super help yeah there's got to be a jitsy version of that right or like do you pay for Otter     
1:05:39     
and it just yeah you pay for Otter but I mean like YouTube does a lot of the extraction too like if you use YouTube     
1:05:46     
it'll make chapters which you can you can queue up and so you can do we used I     
1:05:51     
used to do blog posts like summarizing discussions over several weeks you know     
1:05:57     
we're okay this discussion is this and we have a link to it and that but um     
1:06:02     
yeah yeah I mean I mean to Pa's Point like like I I think I think a lot more     
1:06:07     
people would would get something from it if we had a RSS feed that was that was     
1:06:14     
you know syndicating your your links and like kind of just major themes of the     
1:06:20     
you without even like the transcription or anything you know anyway I love it     
1:06:26     
people can follow up because the problem is if we generate long scripts people     
1:06:32     
are not going to be able to them I mean I don't know everybody else but I am overed I'm interested in conversations     
1:06:39     
but there's only some they can't go through the brain but what I need to     
1:06:44     
focus on are the resources that are being shared and the main points that you know make a discovery make a     
1:06:50     
conference or oh this is useful this and then people can Pi on whatever is useful with then so I would     
1:06:58     
start very minimally with you know minor blur and just whatever people want to     
1:07:04     
contribute to like you know for example I'm going to this conference well just put the link there um I have this fa     
1:07:12     
patient put the link in the couple of line and then at the end uh it's going     
1:07:17     
to be easy to look back and to try to remember what everybody did or said     
1:07:23     
because otherwise I would know     
1:07:31     
yeah would be yeah I mean always work out these strategies and then they kind of we forget like we kind of drop them     
1:07:39     
because they're I don't know I mean like we've had a number of these rounds where     
1:07:45     
we say oh this would be a great idea we start the practice and then it kind of goes away so I mean you know it's     
1:07:51     
something that we'll have to revisit probably again and we'll see how that goes but yeah I mean well we'll think about     
1:07:58     
it some more I guess yeah and and like Jesse says in the chat uh you know he     
1:08:04     
talked about the notion workspace using docs and GitHub or combination of tools that exist otter AI is a is a paid     
1:08:11     
service so it's kind of you have to justify that investment and I don't know if there's a free version I mean otter     
1:08:18     
AI you can do it for free but it's not like doesn't do very much so the the     
1:08:25     
other things say in my lab manager hack for this is sort of um I think I think that like     
1:08:34     
yeah outside of you know I don't want to dwell on on that but like I think     
1:08:40     
functionally it comes down to like a critical mass of interest that sustains     
1:08:45     
it because yeah that's what that's what does it or not um and we have a critical     
1:08:52     
mass Messa let's let's I mean I'm finally riding the wave again and trying to do that too also like I do want to     
1:08:57     
get some um even like General like assistant lab manager support stuff or     
1:09:02     
like interns to help with that because it's something that um is is an opportunity that's come before that said     
1:09:11     
um oh one other thing too no nobody nobody reads everything in slack and in     
1:09:18     
reality our slack has kind of become a link dump with a bunch of topics and the     
1:09:23     
slack is not Project based I think another point that Paula brings up is sort of where is what's happening     
1:09:31     
projectwise in the lab and I think I might just consolidate that     
1:09:36     
into I mean I think I think what I've been sort of trying to do is just post the updates from like from actual K     
1:09:44     
Futures meetings or or C in general um but like I think there could just be a     
1:09:52     
project development Channel that's like what's happening because the conversations are one thing     
1:09:57     
but like there are there's work like DSN project there's stuff happening in the reading group stuff coming in Futures     
1:10:04     
there's a cybernetics manuscript that's being made but like it's they're not they're like buried you know like nobody     
1:10:10     
knows that unless you go the meetings and that's a hard thing to do and it's it's weird because     
1:10:17     
um you know this this La group is extremely public and and and we're kind     
1:10:24     
of talking about a lot of things that we're doing here but at the same time like these aren't all like these like     
1:10:31     
this meeting isn't like a working meeting so it's kind of it's tough and it's confusing that way at times and I     
1:10:38     
think I've been you know um I'm always considering the best way to deal with     
1:10:44     
that um but this SL yeah like I think we should I think we should give people disclaimer like hey there's not an     
1:10:51     
expectation that you read everything in the slack channels because it's like no like it's impossible to do like we don't     
1:10:56     
even get through them on the week on we catch up with them most of the time you know um and then finally and and and     
1:11:05     
maybe the most productive point I'm trying to make is I actually am     
1:11:11     
prospecting a few Automation Services both for like segmenting and transcripts     
1:11:17     
and other things but for myself but also like I would easily double dip with a lab if I'm going to do it anyway and     
1:11:24     
there you know there's ACH services like that do transfer but also like in an     
1:11:29     
Ideal World I'd love to segment the videos and break them down and like useful discussions and then have those     
1:11:37     
discussions be like their own playlist that would be like really awesome and you know Auto generate like a Blog from     
1:11:43     
it or something or but like that's they not quite here yet and it's it's also     
1:11:48     
very tough because um like AI summarizers are are kind of     
1:11:55     
okay for like what does this generic news article     
1:12:01     
say happened about very obvious topics and I find that quality drops off     
1:12:07     
really fast when you get into technical spaces or inary spaces are things that are actually competing themes and     
1:12:13     
narratives like it really it really just it's you know it's not the same um and     
1:12:19     
if people find things that are really good at that like you know more academic summarizers     
1:12:25     
like kagi or or I forgot what it's called um not not kagle but there's     
1:12:31     
there there's a bunch of summarizers that floating my way um and I'd be     
1:12:37     
really curious to find things that could generate summaries at that level too but     
1:12:43     
just just to mention like it's been on on my mind and I would like to do it different fronts thank you de I'll     
1:12:51     
um I'll just say that by the way if we had a Google doc for each meeting just     
1:12:58     
to take and share Qui notes I think this could also maybe because I see that     
1:13:04     
Bradley is writing so I presume Bradley is writing notes is that right Bradley     
1:13:09     
taking notes uh yeah I do take notes yeah we have notes where do you where do     
1:13:15     
you take them in paper uh usually yeah and then I transcribe it to a digital     
1:13:20     
format so I have not so why not have a gole dog where you could write them directly into the do unless you want to     
1:13:25     
keep them to yourself but if you want them to be useful then we could all help yeah so rather than you have brought     
1:13:32     
everything done I could write my links so you don't have to write them and then     
1:13:37     
transcribe and and also it could help me because during the week I see a lot of     
1:13:42     
things that's a really nice thought as you just mentioned at Saturday but then     
1:13:49     
by the next hour I completely forgot the tabs are crashing I completely forgot which pages     
1:13:55     
instead what I could do that I could prepare manying contribution for every meeting saying oh these are the things     
1:14:02     
i' like to sh today and it's going to be like a few bullet points links and it's     
1:14:08     
could be as aonics for for what we want to talk about on on Saturday and and     
1:14:13     
then if we don't have time we always we still have the link there so people can go and check     
1:14:20     
out so let's try that yeah     
1:14:25     
yeah that'd be good um yeah I can well notes I take I usually like type them up     
1:14:30     
and share them I don't share them but I can like I can put them in a format and     
1:14:35     
and Link them off of the so the YouTube uh video usually has the stub underneath     
1:14:41     
and that's where a lot of the metadata lives those can also go on GitHub there's a GitHub stub for it as well um     
1:14:49     
so there are a lot of ways we can do this um but yeah I can go over that maybe next week too     
1:14:55     
how this is done so for taking suggestion on board at some point this     
1:15:01     
late night I might I might drop down drop out but if we had a Jour but we     
1:15:09     
have the video right so thank you so much and everyone and in particular thank you for for we giving a spage for     
1:15:16     
people can share and thank you yeah yeah Ro trying to make the materials better     
1:15:22     
because it's there's always so much in there okay so we had uh Hussein said I'm just     
1:15:28     
glad we don't use zoom and zoom of course is very yeah it's it's okay it's not okay     
1:15:35     
security and privacy reasons aside those are the biggest reasons but like it's completely outdated come some like like     
1:15:41     
Zoom but sorry just my personal op I want yeah I wanted to ask um also yeah Google meets jitsy um anything else just     
1:15:49     
not zoom like like like Zoom got lucky that happen to be the big thing during     
1:15:55     
the pandemic it was not ideal it was not ideal it just caught on so everybody used it you know um anyway sorry uh so     
1:16:03     
let's let's talk can I talk yeah that's great thank you um can we talk about the     
1:16:10     
ethical considerations yeah yeah I can um I can share my screen how does that sound um yeah go ahead I mean I I shared     
1:16:16     
the documents in slack but I'm I'll share the screen anyways I'll sh my tab there we go so this is an idea for a     
1:16:23     
manuscript all the ethical considerations of AI to loose close loop stimulation or like like neuro neuro     
1:16:29     
neur stimulation essentially um as uh as I've outlines the general broad question     
1:16:36     
you want to ask is what are the ethical considerations related to AI assisted um     
1:16:42     
Clos Loop Clos Loop closed loop closed loop neuros stimulation so neuros     
1:16:49     
stimulation being the like the close the close loop protocol between uh detecting like say signal from the brain uh being     
1:16:56     
able to visualize the EG M EOG F whatever you're looking at and command to an external device you know say like     
1:17:03     
uh for motor control for maybe speech for tactile tactile anything um and that     
1:17:11     
device sends the signal back to a controller and then an encoder which that is the AI That's is your artificial     
1:17:18     
intelligence so whatever whatever the response is given from the brain and how it conducts or communicates with the environment and world around it how is     
1:17:24     
that as sent to device that operates using deep learning machine learning or AI approaches to reinforce and create a     
1:17:30     
closed loop feedback with the person who setting out the brain activity of the signals itself okay um essentially um     
1:17:38     
this has been used already as I've outlined in the paper or the the this very very very rough draft of notes if     
1:17:43     
you want to get a paper or something like this together I definitely could suggest doing this by the summer at the very least having a decently put rough     
1:17:49     
draft because we're going to have to be very very thorough on the literature and make sure we're creating and putting something you the table bringing     
1:17:55     
something that hasn't been written about before there already a lot of papers on AI syst approaches to healthcare like     
1:18:01     
like medicine medical technology in general but not so much specifically on AI assisted Clos Loop stimulation or     
1:18:08     
neuros stimulation approaches so um yeah there's my Spiel hopefully we can get on     
1:18:13     
board this with this pretty pretty soon and yeah this is just going to be about publishing a paper you know no one's     
1:18:19     
getting paid I'm not like this isn't for like gck or anything but you know uh coauthor hon manuscript is great work     
1:18:26     
anyways so um thanks guys yeah yeah so this is meant to be a review article     
1:18:32     
right yeah that's awesome yeah IDE ideally a review but we are posing our own questions too we're giving our own     
1:18:37     
opinions and our critical critics and comments like what are the considerations themselves with um with a     
1:18:43     
sister close loop you know stimulation nothing so yeah um     
1:18:50     
I uh could see some analysis being done like some data so     
1:18:55     
um charts plots figures graphs being driven on [Music] say     
1:19:02     
um certain metrics like say explainability uh okay excuse me like     
1:19:08     
the actual impacts and effects on the health in the humans those can be Quantified um and seeing um to what     
1:19:16     
extent these um you know so so there there what I'm saying is there can be some analysis with this it's not just     
1:19:22     
reading papers and you know creting like encyclopedia we are going to be doing our analysis ourselves for this too even     
1:19:27     
if it is a literature you know that's not completely devoid of you know um like say graphs figures charts and stuff     
1:19:33     
so yeah um cool so this is a great one to get on board with I think um     
1:19:40     
yeah yeah we want to do this we definitely have to kind of think about the schedule for it so like how long you     
1:19:48     
know someone wants to take responsibility for a certain section you know please do so but you have to stay     
1:19:54     
to a schedule say I'm going to do this in every week I'm going to do a little bit of review or synthesis or whatever     
1:20:02     
and then we can bring it together later and writing papers collaboratively is     
1:20:07     
one of the great um challenges I think of uh because you know you have a number     
1:20:13     
of people who want to put their stuff in and you have to get all the stuff in a timely manner and then integrated into     
1:20:20     
the paper and then getting uh you know everything edited     
1:20:25     
so that it makes sense to the the reader because the reader is the person who really consumes it and does something     
1:20:32     
with it so you want to make it relevant to the readers of wherever this is going to be published I suggest you know we do     
1:20:39     
this we get this together we kind of you know people make their contributions and then do a pre-print where people can     
1:20:46     
comment on it and then eventually you can get published but you know a lot of     
1:20:52     
times people will pre-print it and then say you know solicit like say on social     
1:20:57     
media and say how can you know do are we on the right track how can this be improved this is timely but maybe it     
1:21:04     
could be more timely you'll get feedback like that and but you know also it's     
1:21:10     
um you know it it's really kind of I think a lot of the things we've been talking about in like brain organoids     
1:21:17     
and in computational Psychiatry could really be put into this paper I I don't know uh if you go     
1:21:25     
through the channel you know you might see themes you might be able to get a sense of like some of these     
1:21:30     
issues there might be some papers that kind of capture your imagination so really I think we should leverage that I     
1:21:37     
think I think I didn't I didn't I pit this idea for a paper like22 wasn't it 2022 and then like I I     
1:21:44     
made some progress but ultimately it was like there was no that there was no like specific purpose like there was no     
1:21:50     
upcoming conference or thing for it but I think um you know it's sorry excuse me like I I'm the type     
1:21:58     
of person who like like I kind of like not necessarily like need to have a     
1:22:03     
purpose for what I'm doing but it can be hard to like get together and say let's just do a paper Willy Lilly and it's     
1:22:09     
like okay but what's the overall goal or what's this gonna you know like that can be hard to give but yeah um you know     
1:22:15     
there's always conferences and symposiums and abstruct submissions opening up left and right for all these sorts of things so regardless of whether     
1:22:22     
I see one right now like you know like in the next few months which we're not going to get it that that's way too     
1:22:28     
quick um to get a paper together so it's great to have this in mind uh right now so yeah yeah     
1:22:36     
thanks excuse me like yeah sorry no no I was just gonna say that     
1:22:43     
and this kind of relates to power to of uh yeah I I I put a lot more neuro     
1:22:51     
ethics um links and and meetings in neurot Access slack uh     
1:23:02     
and yeah it U so I haven't thought about     
1:23:07     
it in a while but I've definitely been um continuing to to track things and     
1:23:15     
narch accents on what I what I would call neuroethics you know and there's there's actually been a lot of you know     
1:23:21     
really interesting you know legal things happening um and you know both     
1:23:28     
discussions and you know Colorado just passed this law um     
1:23:34     
and there's a discussion in a couple other states about this yeah very happy to talk     
1:23:41     
about and and just related to the previous discussion as well about um     
1:23:47     
non-invasive brain stimulation like also again like the discussions     
1:23:54     
happening a bit more Nur techx on that regard um you know computational or     
1:23:59     
Psychiatry is more my interest but uh I follow with with yeah a Keen Eye on the     
1:24:08     
the new developments in Nur generation especially     
1:24:13     
around um you know the causes of mild cognitive impairment and and further     
1:24:18     
dementia with um both the glymphatic system and as well as the     
1:24:25     
overall cerebral vascular issues uh and     
1:24:30     
the different the different interactions there you know in     
1:24:37     
terms of related to cognition that sounds like would be would be of     
1:24:42     
interest to pal yeah thanks thanks so much um yeah     
1:24:48     
we we see I wanted to quickly say something okay to hin hin what did you     
1:24:56     
see my not about methodology I wanted you to spend a a few seconds just to say     
1:25:03     
what do you think about my no you're you're absolutely correct like we need to identify the concerns and address     
1:25:09     
them um just some plan and stick with the topics so about what like what     
1:25:15     
exactly are the ethical concerns like like being clear about that I think I outlined a few things like the core     
1:25:20     
teams of the ethical dilemas or I can actually put them in the chat there if you want to take a look but it's in the documents um there's a section there's a     
1:25:26     
small section that says four themes of ethical dilemas so starting by expanding upon those four would definitely be the     
1:25:32     
best thing to do and structuring the paper out outside around that I could see things going forward like that so     
1:25:40     
yeah um thank you because there's so much stuff in that paper there's a short     
1:25:46     
paper with like a hundred ideas and if you want to write a paper I'm afraid that's one thing I've learned on my skin     
1:25:53     
you need to Define what you want to write the paper on and just you know follow a fairly and I I writing     
1:26:02     
open FL free flow is good but we never get to the Bott     
1:26:09     
soad you want to yeah thanks so much I'm definitely     
1:26:15     
open to um being more focused about a specific topic or specific like set of topics     
1:26:22     
because all the links that I've given here yeah there are many links and a lot of them are kind of like not exactly so related like I link the stord     
1:26:28     
encyclopedia page um that's a good starting point to look for sources but we're not writing about just philosophy     
1:26:34     
and ethics in general we are focusing on this specific topic for AI system close loop neuros stimulation so we'll see     
1:26:40     
where things go with that yeah um okay yeah and I would like to at least have a     
1:26:48     
bit of a data approach somewhere in here even if it's just like a small or simple grapp a visualization of some kind it's     
1:26:54     
just you know literary literary review of ethical issues it's like this where would you go with that     
1:27:01     
but you know that's something I'd like to keep in mind I think that would be cool to have like like more of not a high priority but more of a cool to have     
1:27:07     
sort of thing so it's got keep that mind yeah great that sounds great um so yeah     
1:27:15     
I'm gonna move on to some things I had to like some features some     
1:27:21     
news uh so one of the things I wanted to point out was that uh I just got done     
1:27:27     
writing a paper for the uh it's actually for vaa AI 2024 but it's not being it it     
1:27:37     
they're doing it in a different way this year so the deadline was really quick so     
1:27:42     
I'm right I wrote this uh stuff on alisasas machines and some modeling work     
1:27:48     
that I've been kind of doing in in notes note form on a continuous cognitive mod     
1:27:54     
modeling and so I've got this uh s archive preprint version of this where     
1:28:00     
it kind of goes through uh sort of our our work on Al estasis machines but kind     
1:28:07     
of going through some of the modeling mathematical modeling of it and so this is uh on the S     
1:28:14     
archive uh kind of some ideas about how to like look at different perturbations     
1:28:21     
during continuous cognition different responses and things like that you have to read through the paper to know we've     
1:28:27     
done some work on Al estasis machines which are basically these uh outputs of     
1:28:33     
cognition so the idea is you have some artificial model or some brain you or     
1:28:40     
some model of the brain where you have sensory information coming in and the cognitive output comes out like this and     
1:28:48     
you get these perturbations that happen independently of information processing in the internal model which which is     
1:28:54     
like the nervous system or some AI model and then the system can either recover     
1:28:59     
from those perturbations or it gets driven to some in unstable state or some     
1:29:05     
new regulated state so this is very much in the spirit of the alistic uh stuff     
1:29:12     
that we've been talking about in um in our Co our cognition Futures group and     
1:29:18     
in our cybernetics group uh and then you know this is we did a paper on Al     
1:29:24     
estasis machines uh it with you know sort of more of a theoretical bent so that paper     
1:29:31     
was at sigai in 2021 so this is kind of a followup to some of those ideas and     
1:29:38     
you know this is a shorter paper so it's like just for the conference uh so we'll see you know how     
1:29:45     
this is received you know uh we did want to at one time write a paper on alisasas     
1:29:51     
machines using reinforcement Le which would be a natural sort of approach to     
1:29:56     
this problem where you know you have some like instead of internal model here     
1:30:02     
you would have uh a a reinforcement learning algorithm and then that     
1:30:07     
reinforcement learning algorithm would produce outputs from the policy uh Choice and then those     
1:30:13     
perturbations would either you know uh you could recover from those perturbations or not and if you can't     
1:30:20     
then you would change your policy something like that and but that never got anywhere so I you know we might     
1:30:27     
write another paper you know some of us on using Al estasis machines but instead     
1:30:34     
of you know kind of a cognitive model or you know kind of like a theoretical paper we use something uh with uh like a     
1:30:42     
machine learning methodology or reinforcement learning methodology and     
1:30:47     
um you know actually producing some results in that in that area so this is     
1:30:53     
a area that you know we've been working on kind of uh off and on and I think you     
1:30:59     
know um I'm kind of hoping that we can you know these are we have a bunch of things in this uh in this developmental     
1:31:07     
AI area we've done developmental neuros simulation we've done this Al estasis     
1:31:12     
machines work and we have some other things that we've been developing and it's kind of an off andon affair because     
1:31:19     
we get opportunities to kind of work these ideas out and present them     
1:31:24     
uh and that's good but you know it's uh like you know with the uh EI Workshop     
1:31:30     
they're not consistent so if people are you know and I should make more of an advertisement for some of these     
1:31:37     
techniques um but you know we'd like to work out some of these can you know kind     
1:31:43     
of attach themselves to one of these techniques and work out a nice paper so that's that's uh new on the S     
1:31:52     
archive another thing I'd like to talk about is this uh Galaxy project this is     
1:31:58     
uh the Galaxy 2024 I guess that's a conference on this project so Galaxy is a pipeline for     
1:32:07     
genomics is it uh Morgan yeah yeah it's sort of um think     
1:32:15     
of it as a like a distro um slash um uh like globous user     
1:32:25     
you know what I mean yeah like like um you know I I I haven't actually looked     
1:32:32     
at the history but I want to say um that I saw it first at um ventner Institute     
1:32:39     
you know like and like just to remember how important ventner was in terms of um     
1:32:47     
getting sequencing um computational sequencing you know     
1:32:54     
going yeah and and you know like like how much that was yeah they were they     
1:33:00     
were like great early adopters of of a lot of Open Source Tech onb that which     
1:33:06     
was awesome yeah yeah so this is an event in Czech     
1:33:12     
the Czech Republic uh and this is their Flagship event yeah yeah sorry and then then the     
1:33:19     
other just backstory for this is that um is where um that's town is where red hat     
1:33:28     
is based really and um yeah yeah yeah so     
1:33:33     
like it's their kind of secret uh yeah it's the unfortunate like CH you know     
1:33:41     
like choosing people engineering you know engineering talent that they can pay     
1:33:47     
less than you know us Engineers right but uh um like fedora     
1:33:54     
um um we we used to always have conferences in in you know or     
1:34:01     
near near there because that's where the their um engineering team was outside     
1:34:08     
like biggest group outside of the states yeah and they have a great open source     
1:34:14     
conference to um I think it's Dev Devcon um     
1:34:19     
anyway some good history there yeah so yeah this is uh this is G Galaxy     
1:34:27     
project.org so this is uh where they're looking for like uh methods tools     
1:34:34     
pipelines trainings or software that push the field of data science of Galaxy forward so this is of course this galaxy     
1:34:42     
platform um if you go here Galaxy project they kind of go through they     
1:34:48     
have tutorials videos FedEd workflows which are just kind of like formalized     
1:34:54     
workflows so if you're doing a lot of genomics uh data or you're working on biomedical sequence data you know you     
1:35:01     
want to have a good workflow and and people publish these so you don't have to reinvent the wheel uh they have a     
1:35:08     
Blog so you can catch up on things they have their Community their data sets uh     
1:35:15     
and then you know help and support so this is a nice set of resources and you     
1:35:20     
know this is again you know the kind of model that we want to use for open     
1:35:25     
source for these kind of big projects but you know for smaller projects this     
1:35:31     
works well to this kind of structure where you have the tutorials and the workflows and the video tutorials and     
1:35:39     
data sets and things like that so um this is a nice set of resources and uh     
1:35:44     
hopefully I don't know we don't really do a lot in that space But I am slightly     
1:35:50     
familiar with Galaxy um yeah it's a nice Community there you have anything else     
1:35:55     
to say about that     
1:36:01     
Morgan uh no I can I can follow up though um yeah I I was definitely interested I     
1:36:09     
wonder if it's being used by more um more projects now and like outside of     
1:36:16     
of you know bi informatics but you know I also wondered like how     
1:36:23     
much um what's the um like like how much you     
1:36:29     
see like bioconductor there and you know other big bioinformatics     
1:36:35     
uh things anyway yeah it's it's it's great     
1:36:41     
and and you know this theme that that I've also been     
1:36:47     
pushing and until recently like with a number of projects but now ner desk kind     
1:36:54     
of puts it all together and is giving you kind     
1:37:00     
of yeah where it's like a a multi-do platform because of containerization     
1:37:07     
allows for for so much more than than how we' kind of previously been trying     
1:37:14     
to create a platform um and their use of of you know these tools that are coming     
1:37:21     
from CERN that are again and really really interesting learning from how you     
1:37:28     
know CERN does massive collaboration with you know thousands of physicists     
1:37:35     
looking at super large data sets of of a size that are you know that are     
1:37:42     
difficult to get on your laptop you know what I yeah and um and and you know this is a big it's     
1:37:50     
certainly a big problem in Nur Imaging these days is and um you know and if     
1:37:57     
we're kind of if we're doing things right we'll be a problem in Neuroscience in general from just you know the you know     
1:38:05     
I mean just thinking about like like again like original brain initiative goals right was is like how can we     
1:38:12     
record from every neuron in the brain you know like getting all sorts of you     
1:38:18     
know multimodal data right I mean it was very blue sky but but again you     
1:38:25     
know that was what was so you know so brilliant about it yeah after after the     
1:38:30     
rec after the recent brain cuts too you know so what you can do that was really     
1:38:37     
really tough yeah yeah yeah so that that's that's a     
1:38:43     
big big news in the Neuroscience world for sure     
1:38:49     
yeah the the the French have got huge problems too in terms of there funding     
1:38:54     
oh yeah so then I wanted to go to this oh     
1:39:00     
okay nothing so I wanted to go to this uh this is a Roundup from neps 2023     
1:39:07     
which was a bit off in the past now but uh this is an interesting set of     
1:39:13     
resources on generative protein design so you know neurs of course is they're doing a lot of stuff with uh machine     
1:39:20     
learning and other types of AI I guess mostly machine learning and deep learning but but they're also doing     
1:39:27     
things of course of generative protein design and some bioinformatic stuff uh so this a generative protein     
1:39:34     
design took center stage at murps 2023 in part one of a three-part series we     
1:39:40     
highlight several papers authors and takeaways about the intersection of ML and proteins this is from Dimension     
1:39:48     
which is I think on uh I don't know where I think maybe     
1:39:53     
sub stack based but they have this uh at Dimension cap.com so that's where this     
1:39:59     
is coming from so this is part one uh where they have this machine     
1:40:05     
learning uh in biological research interaction uh I've done my best to tag     
1:40:12     
authors so there's this generative protein design aspect then I think in     
1:40:18     
part two there's generative chemistry and then drug Target interaction prediction so     
1:40:23     
this these are all things that people are kind of exploring with these Technologies um you know of course we     
1:40:29     
know about some of the stuff that's been done with uh respect to uh protein     
1:40:35     
sequence prediction and you know that sort of thing and then you know we have we've     
1:40:41     
there have been a lot of advances in protein folding using uh biophysics models so there's a lot of opportunity     
1:40:48     
here in the space so uh they they have these uh different     
1:40:53     
topics here these kind of takeaways optimizing number one is optimizing     
1:40:58     
proteins in structure space is easier than in sequence space so this is where     
1:41:04     
you know you have these two problems one is protein sequence prediction which is where you have uh proteins as a sequence     
1:41:12     
of amino acids and you're trying to predict those sequences and you know come up with viable proteins you have     
1:41:19     
this other problem which is protein structure prediction which which is kind of like the protein folding problem but     
1:41:26     
kind of predicting the secondary structure of a protein and of course protein secondary structure is critical     
1:41:32     
to to to good function of the protein you have things that are misfolded and     
1:41:37     
they can cause disease or they can become nonfunctional and that can be problematic so then there so there two     
1:41:45     
basic problem spaces here there's structure space and there's sequence space and of course they're different     
1:41:51     
problems because sequence space is sort of this sequence-based thing where it's like a almost like a language model     
1:41:58     
we've talked about in dorm we've talked a little a bit about how people are using large language models to predict     
1:42:06     
uh Gene sequences so uh analyzing genomic data using um llms people have     
1:42:13     
developed a couple of techniques for that this is uh where they talk about the data distributions of of sequence     
1:42:20     
Space versus structure space structure space says more sort of about geometry     
1:42:26     
so data distributions of protein structure smoother making them more tractable to sample from and so this     
1:42:33     
comes through came through several talks and inverse folding So This Is How They approached the problem of structure was     
1:42:40     
through folding large language models are notably absent from the biow workshops compared to diffusion and flow     
1:42:46     
models so people are in protein sequence uh prediction they're using diffusion     
1:42:51     
and flow models and instead of large language models so that's interesting because you know we talked about large     
1:42:58     
language models as being sort of you know you can use it on natural language     
1:43:04     
and then you can also use it on genomes but genomes aren't really natural language so they're somewhat effective     
1:43:10     
but not entirely so it's interesting that you know they're using this different     
1:43:15     
approach as counter argument structured data is much rarer and more expensive to generate so structured data is easier to     
1:43:23     
sort of optimize but it's harder to sort of generate and understand because it's     
1:43:28     
this geometry this geometric information that is not easy because you know a     
1:43:35     
structure or sequence you can just sequence the protein you have the amino acids you know kind of what those     
1:43:41     
combination should look like this is a little harder to to get uh your hands up because you have to do like a     
1:43:47     
crystallography to actually get the structure and that's expensive and you have to kind of then digitize that     
1:43:55     
so uh number two there's still a disconnect between Academia and Industry     
1:44:01     
many talks focused on B binding Affinity which is a thing in proteins where you     
1:44:06     
have binding you know sites and things like that they'll helpful industry and practitioners see more interested in     
1:44:12     
multi-parameter optimization including thermal stability immunogenicity developability     
1:44:19     
Etc so there's this disconnect between what people an Academia interested and     
1:44:24     
an industry industry being like where they're trying to make something useful Academia is where you have these like     
1:44:31     
problems of you know trying to sort of figure out hypothetical structures or     
1:44:36     
you know things that are interesting from an evolutionary standpoint things like that uh but you know it's both are     
1:44:43     
important but they're disconnected number three data leakage overfitting train test splits and     
1:44:50     
experimental validation are key concerns so these are all things that we see in normal machine learning that are now     
1:44:57     
kind of a thing in this field as well model performance fell flat unless authors followed up with a meticulous     
1:45:04     
walkthrough of training and test data benchmarks and inv vitro validation so this is really not an easy area you have     
1:45:11     
to really kind of get the training set right you have to have good benchmarks which are hard in an area where you know     
1:45:18     
you don't have it's not as like the basic problem of pattern recognition and     
1:45:25     
there are a lot of moving Parts here and then in VRA validation of course where you have to do biological     
1:45:32     
experiments so accuracy is great number four scale and throughput matter a lot     
1:45:37     
too so if you're doing drug Discovery for example you need to have things at scale you can't just do small potatoes     
1:45:45     
drug Discovery you have I mean you have to do a lot of experiments you have to do a lot of modeling and get those work     
1:45:51     
together as mentioned in ourl post inference speed is a deciding factor     
1:45:57     
whether a model was useful in Industry so this is theirl po or this is their Twitter thing here where they have uh     
1:46:06     
this is just kind of a Twitter thread where they talk about um inference be of protein structure     
1:46:12     
models uh you know they just kind of go through this discussion here uh so I'm not going     
1:46:19     
to get into that but that's basically what they're talking about um and they talk about protein design     
1:46:26     
using inverse folding so this is the inverse folding methodology uh this is a method to     
1:46:32     
predict a protein's one-dimensional amino acid sequence from its 3D structure so you're predicting uh     
1:46:38     
sequence amino acid sequence from the structure given importance of local 3D     
1:46:43     
structure to antibody antigen binding many authors use inverse folding as a means to constrain and generative     
1:46:50     
antibody process they they'd lock in a tight binding 3D structure and only sample     
1:46:56     
sequences that could satisfy the 3D constraint so this is something you can use to sort of optimize design you can     
1:47:04     
combine sequence and structural data and so there are number of uses for that in     
1:47:11     
biotech um as shown in this figure I won't get into too much um but there's     
1:47:17     
this technique that they use to combine structural information you can see here     
1:47:23     
you can see a uh antibody antigen complex here and you also have sequence     
1:47:30     
data and you're combining these things uh yeah so this is and then of     
1:47:37     
course protein design using diffusion models diffusion models belong to the category of things I can't believe work     
1:47:43     
as well as they do so you know diffusion models have been very popular in the recent past uh basically diffusion     
1:47:51     
models apply random Gan noise to a data distribution an image like so you could     
1:47:57     
take an image and you could add Gan noise to it and you do this in a way uh     
1:48:03     
that obscures the image entirely and you get pure static so if you if you've ever     
1:48:10     
seen like a analog television and you see a a static field on his channel it's     
1:48:16     
not broadcasting that's what they're trying to get to where you just kind of uh add gy noise to an image until you     
1:48:23     
obscure entirely and you have this field of pure static which means that there's no image that you can like recover at     
1:48:30     
all the model then reverses this process generating a final data point representative of the original     
1:48:37     
distribution and so basically you're you're taking an image you're obscuring     
1:48:43     
it with uh gusy and noise you're doing this across the distribution of     
1:48:49     
images uh you're then recovering image where you reverse the process of     
1:48:56     
adding noise you can subtract noise and then you end up getting something that represents the original distribution or     
1:49:02     
you try to approximate that original distribution protein designers are creative applying diffusion models for a     
1:49:09     
variety of tasks including Motif scaffolding protein protein docking and more so this is where you know they're     
1:49:16     
using these diffusion models is a very popular method right now um and so     
1:49:22     
people use this in a lot of image processing where you can add in this noise and you can then take away the     
1:49:28     
noise and try to recover the data um it's it has a lot of connections to physics as well I just ran across the     
1:49:35     
post where people were talking about uh the connection between diffusion models     
1:49:41     
and statistical physics or statistical mechanics so you have these connections     
1:49:46     
to statistical mechanics and you know boltzman uh entropy things like that so     
1:49:54     
that's an interesting set of connections there as well uh but they kind of go through some of their work here this is     
1:50:00     
important in uh molecular design and other things Michael bronstein who does a lot of work     
1:50:07     
on graft neural networks uh did a number of papers on molecular design     
1:50:12     
specifically in Geometry for molecular design and this method molecular surface     
1:50:18     
interaction fingerprinting which is a technique that is shown in this figure which is where     
1:50:25     
you have this protein structure you have the surface you can identify features on     
1:50:30     
the surface uh different binding pockets and and things like that you have this     
1:50:37     
interaction fingerprint which are the structure of these different things uh on the surface of the protein you then     
1:50:44     
have you segment the protein structure through the you know by by segmenting out these     
1:50:51     
patches then you have have these different geometric Fe features and these chemical features that you can add     
1:50:57     
together and it kind of tells you about the sequence in a way that we couldn't get from say like     
1:51:02     
folding or uh well say something about the structure but it it allows us to do     
1:51:08     
that in a way that um we can't know from same like folding studies or even sequence     
1:51:15     
studies um that's so that's an interesting thing there's also a version of this using     
1:51:21     
diffusion which is where they use this massive approach but using a diffusion     
1:51:27     
uh version of it where you have the surface encoding so you encode the     
1:51:32     
surface structure you use a diffusion model to model the structure you you     
1:51:39     
have an encoder that encodes things to a latent space from the surface encoding     
1:51:44     
you decode and you use this diffusion technique to find uh patterns in this     
1:51:50     
structure from the surface encoding and then you can have site prediction from the weight and space which produces     
1:51:57     
canidate structures so that's interesting uh work and so you have all these different     
1:52:04     
data sets you can use like the protein data bank and the database of interacting protein so protein datab     
1:52:10     
bank will have like the structures and the sequences the database of interacting proteins will have the     
1:52:15     
protein protein interaction data and a lot of times people will do stuff with protein protein interactions in networks     
1:52:23     
so they'll use networks to model these interactions but that doesn't tell you a lot about the interactions they just     
1:52:30     
tell you sort of the scope of the interactions and some of the patterns in this case what we're doing is we're     
1:52:36     
reconstructing the sequence the structure and we're looking at the interactions very specifically in terms     
1:52:42     
of those things you can combine this with network Theory you can combine this with other things uh and really kind of     
1:52:50     
learn a lot about proteins and then of course we have energy based models which is as I said the diffusion     
1:52:57     
techniques have connections to boltzman entropy and boltzman statistical based statistical mechanics but um you know     
1:53:04     
there there's more explicit work on this in terms of energy based models so energy based models Bridge energy and     
1:53:12     
probability with how they represent data distributions for example proteins and     
1:53:17     
favorable confirmations exist in low energy states which are local Minima in in that     
1:53:23     
space increasing the probability that an optimization process lands there the     
1:53:28     
bridge between energy and probability is called the boltzman distribution so the boltzman distribution of course is known     
1:53:34     
in statistical mechanics as a way to characterize the distribution of a set     
1:53:40     
of particles and as they uh undergo entropy and they get their energy     
1:53:45     
minimized you can capture that landscape and you can find the Minima and it tells     
1:53:51     
you something about that system so um yeah this they talk bit about     
1:53:56     
energy based models in prot in proteomics which is what they're doing here so there was a lot of interesting     
1:54:03     
work on this uh and then that's it for this uh post so there was a part two and a part     
1:54:10     
three which I won't go through but those are also available from this     
1:54:15     
blog so that's uh my recap of that I wanted to go over that because I think it's really interesting in terms of the     
1:54:23     
both the bioinformatics and some advances in machine learning and what's going on in that     
1:54:30     
space yeah and and they've got they've got large databases like you said of of     
1:54:39     
structures and you know composition     
1:54:44     
um you know different modalities collected in terms of uh     
1:54:52     
looking at those different ways to kind of measure things about those structures not     
1:54:59     
necessarily give you the structure in terms of like crystallography but but things that give you something about the     
1:55:06     
bonds that that are really interesting um anyway like like I think     
1:55:13     
that that speaks to you know these databases give you a better sense of why     
1:55:19     
these these diffusion models are are helpful right     
1:55:25     
um you know in terms of how diffusion models have been helpful in in you know     
1:55:30     
image generation and so you know some some interesting things     
1:55:37     
that have been applications in Medical Imaging in     
1:55:42     
terms of of MRI using diffusion models too um anyway yeah it's it's great um uh     
1:55:51     
I've really um got a lot from being on I think it's M2 d2's     
1:55:57     
slack um which is kind of like n's you know n's protein     
1:56:05     
design um bi informatics group and U and you know I see I see a     
1:56:13     
lot of speakers coming from Vante so I saw Braun students the chief science     
1:56:18     
officer for for v um and um yeah they're they're it's     
1:56:26     
been it's been interesting to follow developments there yeah yeah Michael bronstein is a beast I guess     
1:56:34     
speak yeah yeah yeah for sure right and um     
1:56:40     
um you know but I I I see this or you know like I think I think you Ben blazic     
1:56:46     
you know contact info um who's at the he's like at argon or something there     
1:56:53     
close close to you um but is is you know     
1:56:58     
heads this kind of material science um what do they call it Material Science     
1:57:07     
data platforms anyway it's it's it's all about like using the national lab's big     
1:57:15     
collections of of you know measurements that they've made on     
1:57:21     
material and you know all of this all these databases trying to put that together     
1:57:28     
with you know using large language models and and you know various ml     
1:57:34     
current ml techniques maybe they've got a hackathon that's coming up this next month I think in May anyway really     
1:57:42     
really great you know great use of of ml AI tools with you know with d with large     
1:57:51     
data trying to you know trying to synthesize and you know capture some some some     
1:57:59     
things that basically kind of like sort through all this stuff and find interesting combinations that uh and he     
1:58:07     
seems super you know super well grounded like he's not just trying to we were we     
1:58:12     
were talking about some of the Google Deep Mind stuff that been kind of not not retracted but like but a lot     
1:58:19     
of Material Science people think it should be oh just in terms of you know like yeah they were doing stuff with in     
1:58:28     
that domain and they didn't think it was like up to snow yeah yeah like like we set AI out and it discovered two million     
1:58:36     
new materials and then it's like it takes it takes re you know it takes the research Community a couple years to go     
1:58:43     
through it and be like we see nothing here you know like like you know and and     
1:58:51     
and think you can tell I mean in some discussions I've had with other people in the medical domain uh uh and I think     
1:59:01     
you see the same thing happening where it's just like you know you get these Deep Mind     
1:59:06     
announcements and you know but it's not like anybody you know it's not like deep     
1:59:12     
mind has tried to get medical approval for any of these things and it might     
1:59:18     
have a lot to do with the fact that like when you actually get into the the details you know and try and make tools     
1:59:26     
that actually change patient care like oh wait this isn't actually helpful you     
1:59:31     
know and and you know I haven't I haven't met with her in a while but um     
1:59:37     
noisebridge had a regular from from um Livermore that follows the the Deep Mind     
1:59:44     
work on on nuclear fusion and you know again it's this you know they get a lot     
1:59:51     
of announcements and it's not really clear that it's actually changing you     
1:59:57     
know changing physics or you know whether those whether those tools are actually getting into pipelines in terms     
2:00:05     
of you know um I mean the certainly the big thing here is the national ignition     
2:00:11     
facility and and you know the the time that you can     
2:00:17     
maintain uh a positive fusion reaction has a lot to do you know like has a lot     
2:00:23     
to do about real time control of the lasers right and you know like     
2:00:30     
like I think everybody thinks that reinforcement learning is a really interesting approach to it but it's not     
2:00:36     
clear that it's it's beating out everything yeah at this at this point you     
2:00:42     
know yeah that's a that's an interesting topic where you know we have this issue     
2:00:47     
of like uh people find something that's really interesting using Ai and it's like you're doing this     
2:00:54     
data mining so you're taking a data set you find this stuff and then like it's like well this really useful to what the     
2:01:01     
the problem because there's always been this thing in say like bioinformatics where uh you know people have argued     
2:01:08     
that it's not really problem based like a lot of biological research for example will be focused on problems that people     
2:01:15     
identify and then like in bioinformatics you flip that on its head and you say I'm going to take a method and I'm going     
2:01:21     
to just find things and I'm not going to pose a problem I'm just going to like do a survey and then we'll sort it out     
2:01:29     
later and so you know apparently if you sort it out later it may not be very useful but that's I mean you know I     
2:01:37     
don't know I'm kind of a sort of a skeptic in some ways of the problem-based approach simply because     
2:01:44     
you don't know what problems you have until you do the survey so that may be useful in that way and posing problems     
2:01:50     
and posing questions but um yeah it's it's definitely uh I think the announcements     
2:01:57     
are where you make a big announcement that doesn't mean you have something it just means you can make a     
2:02:02     
big splash and there's a lot of that sort of posturing in big science where they try     
2:02:09     
to say we're doing this we have a lot money     
2:02:14     
yeah I think it actually comes oh sorry I know we're we're already over the two-hour Mark so um you know people have     
2:02:21     
to go then so be it I think but yeah thanks so much for for sharing all this stuff too and like speaking of halfathon     
2:02:27     
I do just want to briefly mention I wasn't nurota Without Borders uh last week that was pretty fun I already spoke     
2:02:32     
about it with with Bradley and Morgan um and that was so that was down in Houston neuro data Without Borders 2024 and     
2:02:40     
we're having some discussions about what we like to do with those hackathons moving forward for this for this hackathon last week it was just three     
2:02:46     
days working from like 9 to 5 and that you know that's that's like um you know     
2:02:51     
including like meetings like other activities it was pretty fun but more so about networking and getting people     
2:02:56     
together so yeah we just want to see what we want to moving forward but I know for sure inperson physical     
2:03:02     
hackathons like I really miss those it's nice to finally be it's really nice to finally be at those again so     
2:03:10     
yeah yeah those are always good events uh so I mean how do you how do you find     
2:03:16     
hackathons I mean how do you find them useful how do you follow up on hackathons yeah I mean I when you when     
2:03:22     
you said how do you find hackathons I meant mostly through like M list okay yeah and things but like how do you find     
2:03:28     
useful you know it is at the very least putting on your resume or CV that you attended to hackathon is a really good     
2:03:33     
sign being able to post about it on social media on LinkedIn or Twitter being able to network out through those ways too um and having some sort of     
2:03:41     
recognition or validation of what you've done what you've done even if you're not say like number one like if's putting     
2:03:48     
forward project and putting on your portfolios if you work there that's really really strong and a really really thing to do to do too so yeah but     
2:03:56     
nothing beats inperson collaboration so yeah yeah and then when you follow up on     
2:04:02     
things do you how do you how do you ensure that you get to do the next step     
2:04:08     
I mean is there like a a technique that you've seen that people use or is there     
2:04:13     
an accountability for saying we're going to do all this stuff and then it never gets done or gets done it's tough it's     
2:04:19     
tough because you know it is all voluntary it really is I'm doing a hackathon with a group of other officially there were four other guys on     
2:04:25     
this it's really two of us and then whenever we meet it's literally just like me and me and him like because     
2:04:33     
there's no there's no like requirements like stuff like accountability getting people on board     
2:04:39     
making sure we actually accomplish stuff that's really difficult so you just have to practice like good good interpersonal practical skills to see what works and     
2:04:47     
see how things work out um I would say that but ultimately I feel like pitching     
2:04:52     
to investors and investment funds like say Cy Foundation seeing you get some sort of monetary reward that's what's     
2:04:58     
going to get people on board and um you know you can say like oh we want a hackathon with a price of like $2,000     
2:05:04     
then if you pitch that to like a like a foundation of some sorts then they'll be much more willing to fund it you know     
2:05:10     
because then people will be on board to want to get together and do that sort of stuff because if you just say like like I know for this one down in Houston I     
2:05:17     
was willing to travel down there because there was funding for me to travel with the hotel and     
2:05:22     
uh to fly there through the NIH otherwise I probably couldn't have even afforded to do it just just respectfully     
2:05:28     
money money is money okay yeah yeah um so that's that's one of more practical     
2:05:33     
Logistics things and we're discussing like you know depending on like time duration like how long you going to get     
2:05:41     
involved with those things this one was three days so I was just SC down there to Texas for three days and then coming     
2:05:47     
back and that's time out of my week weekday weekly schedule because it was verying the week um so you just have to     
2:05:54     
be wise and um like judicious with how you are budgeting time and how you think     
2:06:00     
people themselves can adapt so you know what have you well I think that yeah that's as     
2:06:06     
good as any other strategy I've heard so I just wanted to get your take on it because that is a thing you know if we     
2:06:13     
do a hackathon we want to do things we want to have things result from that we     
2:06:19     
just do things in the hackathon and forget about them it's not very useful so um yeah and then we've talked about     
2:06:25     
you know different hackathons and that's one of the things about like you know besides planning a hackathon like what     
2:06:33     
are the results of that so we've had like working sessions in the LA at the very even when people are doing     
2:06:39     
voluntary work together like in a group or like a huddle like i''s say there's like three or four of us right yeah you     
2:06:45     
know when you're working in a small group like that um accountability is much easier and much more effective like     
2:06:50     
I told you in my other haathon that I'm working with there's five of us but two of our members just haven't gotten back     
2:06:55     
to us in like four or five weeks so I've I've already kicked them out you know that is just unacceptable yep yeah yeah     
2:07:03     
and I reached out to them several times and you know so you see what I'm saying like anybody can get on board and it's     
2:07:08     
really easy you know it's kind of like signing up for a mailing list signing up for a group for a project but it's all     
2:07:13     
free and everything's over available to you you'll get like 10 times as many more people signing up versus how many     
2:07:19     
people actually show up and then when people show up how can you keep people on board to Coral them to get people bu     
2:07:24     
together so ideally like being transparent open accountable and     
2:07:29     
straightforward with all these things is the best thing but you know I don't needan to like be super     
2:07:36     
like like I don't know like businesslike towards these approaches because it's all about the science about the research     
2:07:42     
yeah but if everything's free people don't value it if I want to     
2:07:48     
have like an open an open workshop on teaching people how to use switch to stream science and I say it's free and     
2:07:53     
open to the public and it'll all be recorded no one's going to take it seriously and no one will value it so     
2:08:00     
you just got to be wise about how you brand yourself your time and your energy and the products that you're committing to and what you yourself are doing so I     
2:08:08     
know like with my other project we're making a VR CA app like ca being like     
2:08:13     
the fitness dance from Brazil and African Brazilian countries so I'm really absolutely branding that as     
2:08:19     
something people can put on their resume and CV in a very like um you know Social     
2:08:25     
Fitness music martial arts sort of sort of manner you know     
2:08:32     
yeah oh yeah that's great yeah I think that's those are wonderful sort of insights um so yeah thank you Morgan was     
2:08:41     
gonna say something uh well uh     
2:08:48     
sorry as soon as I say that they're grinding C uh but nerch X Global haon um yeah     
2:08:59     
just trying to think about how to structure it so that there's fewer fewer     
2:09:06     
projects you know that kind of get half done and then forgotten and and uh like one of the     
2:09:16     
things that's that we're talking about is you know is trying to kind of see if     
2:09:24     
we can do one larger project together     
2:09:29     
you know and U something that John     
2:09:34     
Griffith is is been been advocating for     
2:09:40     
um which which I think would be would actually be really awesome if we can if we can make it work um and um sorry I     
2:09:49     
don't know if I'm if I'm coming through on this wi-fi here     
2:09:55     
you're fine anyway um okay Co so um but yeah just like like very much uh behind     
2:10:05     
everything that you know's already said and um um and yeah very very interested to     
2:10:13     
hear you know more details about the nerd data Without Borders uh and uh you     
2:10:20     
know particular the spy glass projects or     
2:10:26     
you which I think is another kind of cool ini built on top of built on top of     
2:10:33     
yeah yeah exactly we were we were discussing um spy glass pretty closely there too and once again we're now like     
2:10:39     
20 like like 10 or 12 minutes overboard I'm sorry Bradley you the meeting I'm     
2:10:44     
sorry thanks thanks guys I know because like usually these meetings two hours so okay thanks thanks     
2:10:51     
two and a half yeah yeah Saturday we all have we all have things to do don't we     
2:10:57     
sorry but even then like like the and I appreciated the discussions On neurot     
2:11:03     
Without Borders and the ideology especially behind products like spy glass and things too like the framework for the you know reproducible sharable     
2:11:10     
pipelines um you know just like just like realistically we're all still considering     
2:11:15     
like maybe not we're all but I personally on some level have been legitimately considering how closely you     
2:11:21     
can still tie to that ideology you know that information wants to be free like neurodata Without Borders it's in the     
2:11:27     
name we don't want borders on things and how effectively and practically we can still maintain hackathons projects     
2:11:34     
people getting on board with things if we're just prioritizing so much of that um you know open source ideology that's     
2:11:42     
uh is Central to a lot of the mission by hand lot of projects but still encouraging people to get on board to     
2:11:48     
contribute and see what we can do so there's my t     
2:11:53     
that's great yeah all right uh well what do we uh     
2:12:00     
well does anyone else have anything they want to share know if Jesse had anything else I     
2:12:06     
didn't even to really get to give an update but but like once again my gist is that     
2:12:12     
inperson events iners events above above just     
2:12:17     
virtual stuff all the time okay yeah yep yep if I if I had to travel to Indonesia for     
2:12:24     
a hackathon I would do it yes yeah okay I think it's it's Malaysia in     
2:12:32     
October oh yeah syst machine and cybernetics yeah oh     
2:12:39     
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I forget if it's October or November but it's h     
2:12:45     
yeah late fall oh okay all right all right so I think that's it for     
2:12:51     
today um you know we didn't get to go over the slack today but I think that     
2:12:57     
you know that those are we people uh you're in a channel you can go kind of     
2:13:02     
go over things last time we did the brain organoids we've done computational Psychiatry recently so you know those     
2:13:10     
are two that are very active um but yeah if we have any other     
2:13:15     
things uh please bring them up kind of you know you can also bring things from one channel to another another so if you     
2:13:22     
find something that's relevant to another channel uh you can put it in there and so that's I think that's it

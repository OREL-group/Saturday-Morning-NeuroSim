## NOTES
Agile (and Scrum) versus RSE (Research software Engineering).

Slack (Searchable, but less functional the more you use it.

* tendencies carry over from platform to platform. Acquired uselessness.

* 20 minute limit to checking e-mails.


ISO9000 process (this process in workflows).

* Yannick Kilcher -- Devin (AI Software Devs).

* introduced a lot of bugs, then recognized them.

* big week in Neurotech -- G*tech -- based in Austria.


Christof Guger -- talks reflect full spectrum (on YouTube).

* Horse ERP. Equine auditory (non-human primate) ERP.


Tech companies, businesses "Silicon Heartland". Michigan, Indiana, Illinois.

* investments, but is the culture right for success?

* capture talent, capital, change the culture.

Big Five traits: seeing people in different regions having different traits.

* reminiscent national character studies.

* OREL --> look @ Midwest as an opportunity.

* Combine Harmony thread: Sander -- complex human disease. #brain-organoids.

* Tissue Forge, Prola: Psychomotor. Blood Flow triggers Cognitive Mechanisms.


Google Docs for meetings (Notion, Otter.AI). Running log, bot.

* model cards --> Summer of Docs. Mdel cards in open-source meetings.

* combined input form Worm Conference.

* weird learning curve for group.

* scrape all previous YT videos. Burb + links (in RSS feeds).

* Google Meet transcribed.  


Overloaded with Conversations: resources and main points.

* blurb --> segment --> information (annotation).

* critical mass of interest. Things that get buried in Slack, processes get abandoned (what are the incentives).

* is it more than that. Automation Services transcription, video segmentation.

* what do articles say, quality in tool spaces?


Ethical Consideration of AI-assisted Closed-loop Neurostimulation.

* motor control, speech, controller, encoder.

* notes right now, review of literature -- find the niche.

* posing Qs: what are the open issues, concerns?


Neuroethics links in the NeuroTechX Slack.

* non-invasive brain stimulation (Psychiatry, Neurodegeneration).

* data-driven approach.


Galaxy -- distro, globus user. Genomics pipeline (data-intensive biomedical research).

* Galaxy outside of Bioinformatics (Bioconductor, etc).

* theme: Neurodesk, multidistro platform. Tools from CERN. Brain initiative goals -- difficult get on laptop.

* M2D2 Slack -- MILA Bioinformatics -- Ben Blasik from Argonne. MatSci, data platform.

* using national labs material measurement databases.


Hackathon -- ML/AI tools with large data. Synthesize and sort through.

* lessons from fusion, DeepMind.


NWB -- what would we like to do moving forward? In-person physical hackathons.

* resume, CV-worthy. Recognition, validation. Accountability for follow-up -- accomplishing next steps.

* monetary --> $2k bounty (funding, logistics).

* huddle, small group --> easier to enforce. Sign up, show up, do things.

* if everything is free, people don't value it.


Global Hackathon -- avoid half-done projects. One larger projects together. John Griffiths.

* spyglass -- reproducible, sharable pipelines. No borders, maintain Hackathons.

## NOTES
DNA is not architectural plans, but provide generative system for proteins.

* basic assembloids -- better and larger scale for testing.

* #computational-psychiatry, clearest findings in Psychiatry. Actuarial aspect -- physiology of dying young.


Levin -- Bioelectricity in spatial morphogenesis (regeneration to mammals).

* heart (cardiac) organoids: ethics should be foundational.

* Jesse long-term interest, maintain certain pathways (inertial, interest).

* philosophy of science -- teach to undergrad STEM. 

* having real disucssions internal/external, do this with respect to pressures.


Hyperfocus (focus on a singla task) and Flow States (effortless peroformance, autotelic, action, and awareness).

* productivity and creativity. External aspects.

* hyperfocus: distraction-less, cognitive challenges, calm environment, pressure of time milestones.

* flow: unambiguous feedbacks, equilibrium between challenges and skill. Control, clear goals.

* hyperfocus --> flow. VR --> distraction-free learning environment. VR approaches > Traditional approaches.


Create specific task for flow -- hyperfocus.

* gamified task, music to enhance concentration.

* Virtual Desktop --> Quest 2.

* invisible Gorilla task.

* goal: create media for flow states. Detect hyperfocus, documentation.


Hassan, "Flow in VR: A Study on the Relationships Between Preconditions, Experience and Continued Use". "Video Gaming Training in Older Adults". Keep up with game as its changing -- interference during learning.



DSM project -- Jen Jiang -- deep dive into anxiety and specific practices.

* terminology: preformative recovery. Studies on long-term care workers.

* cancer research -- Levin -- cancer is a breakdown of multicellular goals.

* oncology -- interdisiciplinary ground. 


Cerebrus (https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-startup-cerebras-built-a-gargantuan-ai-computer-for-abu-dhabis-g42-with-27-million-ai-cores/) -- neuromorphic case working withg LLMs.

* concrete use cases -- what are benchmarks?

* power efficiency -- silicon neuromorphic memory. 

* TinyML. Good neurotech developments, new paper on MOABB (Mother of All AI Benchmarks).

* motor imagery, psychophysical representations.


Picower institute -- 40Hz stimulation. Improved glymphatic clearance. Non-neuronal action based on visual stimulation.

* glymphatic model is relatively newly-discovered (circa 2012: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glymphatic_system).

* stimulation: improved Glymphatic clearance. Non-neuronal action based on visual stimulation.

* GTech -- BCI Spring School. IEEE Brain -- binding and Gamma -- global stimulation. Clear fluid clearance relieved pressure.

* glymphatic, immune system. Alzheimer's treatments -- alternative to plaques.


Covid's immunological efffects. Brain Organogenesis workshop. 

* eyes and brain organoids -- reservations (Paola). Retinal organoids. Where does consciousness begin?

* Muotri -- seeing neonatal power spectrum in organoids.

* telecenphalon paper -- don't develop as requested, they develop by themselves.


Analogy -- undertones. Norbert Weiner -- Human Use of Human Beings. 

* zeitgeist -- how future is conceived across different time periods.

* culturally-knowable reference. How interactive is analogy?

* vase, piano, waterwheel, computer (input/output). DIrect tie to something being trained.

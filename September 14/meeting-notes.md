## NOTES:
Morgan: tools (NeuroFedora).

* docs focused on Computational Neuroscience. PyMDP, other tools.

* bring it up with Ankur. How is Active inference used?


ActInf, RL agent policy. Ryan Smith's step-by-step tutorial.

* not everything in the world is Bayes Optimal (in Bayes, one thing is most optimal). RL optimal training.

* ActInf overlap with world models. Infer.JL.


Computational Psychiatry, ActInf. CompuCell3D example with pattern formation.

* software tools and morphogenesis --> ActInf, Levin et.al.

* computational psychiatry --> applied RL work.


Queen's Square -- a bunch of great institutions.

* Chris Bishop --> foundational variational Bayes. Bandit models.


POMDPs + RL = Active Inference.

Read Montague -- Peter Dayan collaborations.

* Computational Psychiatry (Zurich).

* Mathematics of Intelligence tutorial (IPAM). Application of RL models to neuroimaging data.

* Modeling gambling, stock trading (Econ tasks).


Parameters demonstrate strategy, risk averseness.

* Ryan Smith -- Step-by-step tutorial --> ActInf + policy training strategy.

* RL -- Fristonian approach.


Ida M. --> history, architecture RL, early 20th century behaviorism.

* produced relevant software tools.

* greater context of ActInf. Neurobench --> animal models, RL models.


JESSE: Combined undergrad/Masters' program.

* collaboration with Valeria, led to Society, Ethics, Technology.

* additional meeting with UAlbany. Foresight Institute grant.


NP (Neurophenomenology) methods group. Has a page on JoPro.

* Mental Health working group --> regular meeting time.

* won't be a standing hour-long meeting.

* exploration/exploitation tradeoff (early ActInf). All about action. Generalize across animals.

* energetic limitation optimal tradeoff.

* Fristonisms: "reduction of surprisal", "Contradictionism" (in opposition to?).

* Friston struggled with ambiguity, reason for exploring variational Bayes.


TREVOR: review commons (no experimental context).

* "Towards a NeuroAI" -- Kording, Zador. Does Neuro have anything to contribute?

* if ANNs are bio-inspired (questionable), then how useful are they how useful are they for Neuro?

* Pfau -- Neuro trying to be AI-relevant.

* what is the "why" of NeuroAI --> Darwinian?


Target Learning vs. Backprop -- use two different models to explain data. Model comparison techniques.

* fitting the data --> single model will fit the data.

* Dynamic Causal Modeling -- compare spatiotemporal models.

* Neuromorphic computing. Efficiencies of neural-biological NNs.


Organoid Intelligence --> overestimate power efficiency (cannot pass inputs in).

* superhuman performance -- in this case, human augmentation.

* Neuromorphic Computing -- more efficient chip architectures --> spiking NNs, or adaptive control. 

* system with power efficiency, expansion.

* series of talks (YT) related to Levin (multiscale issues, biological learning, TAME).

* Ricard Sole -- spiking NNs as non-neuronal processes.


Math of SNNs is so abstracted from neurons, represent NeuroAI.

* can we predict what happens at the next time step?

* Neuron C++ level simulation. Stochasticity in the brain (heterogeneity?)

* is that NeuroAI? How much detail do we need?


Useful from a physics of life perspective? Complexity boundary, how do we achieve criticality, dynamics?

* Diverse Intelligences -- evolution as a learning processes.

* Neuro is an outcome of evolution (Kanwisher's why questions).

* problem-solving all the way down.


Why did this neural structure develop, evolve? 

Ricard Sole is a neural system a means to develop interneurons. Sensory is a single-cell thing.

* movement, Romain Brette --> Paper QA2 system --> "How to solve it" --> LLMs as scientific discovery.

It's funny as it has some strong parallels to the use of "AI" in other industries or products; "because we can mix it in!" is a major driver

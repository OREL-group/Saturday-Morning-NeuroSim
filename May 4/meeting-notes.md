## NOTES
Meeting, May 4:

* JoPro -- mentoring and career incubator.

* experience of what/how to write.

* SynBioBeta -- synthetic biology conference -- organoid.


Side projects: protein engineering.

* growth factor open-source. Sleep medicine course.

* NeuroGPT -- paper and model, foundation models for EEG.


Foundation model -- groups that have a lot of data and compute.

* statisticL mechanics perspective: examine weights of models, fine-tune for a purpose (structure that is useful).

* share blog link (Google Doc).


HAI (hay) @ Stanford. Annual report. 100 years of AI report.

* Steve Brunton -- operator methods, symmetries.

* pins to do model selection (living matter lab).

* James Glazier -- open virtual tissue.

* Mehul -- dataset interest. Paola -- preparation for meetings. Fundings.

* Paola -- meeting with Nick halper. We have a OREL fork of Neuromatch materials (YouTube curriculum, Github).

* slow pods -- paced approach to NM materials.

* human usability for Machine Learning.


Search for meaning of OREL -- natural philosophy lab? Data science and modeling? 

* engineers, managers, others. Want a certain standard, model cards, alternative ways of learning about data.

* funding catechism -- thinking about impact of project.


SIGBOVIK -- blue skies, silly skies thinking.

* absurdism about research, silly questions with real insights.

* importance of bad art.

* organoids -- neuromorphic computing.

Jesse update. NYCWiC (2025 call for volunteers), Oxford events (inclusive gaming). 

* use drones to capture digital landscapes.

* archives of choices and pathways.

* co-design practices for games.


How do you make a health tech product! Unit of creation --> implement. 

* Twisterland -- first attempt at game building. inclusivegaming.notion.site

* challenges in EdTech -- conformation to a specific standard.

* infrastructure for concept-to-market pathway (VR/XR).

* alternative modes of gaming (walking sims).


Making nonlinear problem tractable.

* smaller model -- easier to ID interrpetation.

* feature engineering (DL requires post-hoc work, GLM more interpret design matrix).

* Dynamics AI center (NSF). Unsupervised way to discover governing equations.

Himanshu
Himanshu says:
Linkedin group: 
https://www.linkedin.com/company/orthogonal-rel/
 
9:27

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
I think my ucrrent linkedin account might need accss to the OREL lineking page , that way I can post things there. 
Jes (OREL) says:
also for later: we had a SUPER DUPER successful NYCWiC event earlier this year, and their LinkedIn page really helped network and connect, and I want to tyr to do that a bit more with the lab on that platform 
9:28

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
Thanks Himansu, how do I select a reply to  a specific msg in chat? I do not seem to know how to do that 
9:31

Himanshu

(( I think LinkedIN has some kind of resurgegence lately. It's interesting. It feels much more useful functionally than it did a few years ago. )) 
Jes (OREL) says:

(for those who don't know where these emojis come from, it's in the "raise hand" bar in the bottom of the main screen, you have to click the ^ ) 
9:49

Himanshu
Himanshu says:
Enough data and enough compute / funds 
9:50

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
I love how Morgan said "for those who may have enough data" to start the discussion heh 
Jes (OREL) says:
that too eh 
9:50

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
Mehul, I think here everyone jumps in the talk 
Paola Di Maio says:
no need to ask permission to speak, it is so polite of you, just find the right moment of pause 
Paola Di Maio says:
I mean, do not interrupt but do not hesitate 
9:51

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
ahhhh 
Jes (OREL) says:
"HAI" 
9:52

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
I canno see a raised hand tho, saw a quick popup saying Mehul would like to speak 
9:52

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
yes they have good reports , and I think they also do the 100 years of AI stuff right? 
9:52

Mehul Arora
Mehul Arora says:
oh I was checking out the raise button @paola as @Jes mentioned xD 
9:53

Himanshu
Himanshu says:
üëç 
9:53

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
ah, thats why the request to speak went awy @mehul  normally bradley asks if anyone has anything to say but raising hand is alaway a good idea, I think I ll do it 
9:54

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
We do honor the raised hand feature though, if you do want to do so !

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
I'm defintely interested in how to make mindemaps as a general process, and the software abilities (or rather, hardships) in doing so. We've talekd about that some in the lab before. 
Jes (OREL) says:
I don't think Neuromatch has "OREL" lab material, but rather, we've discussed Neuromatch material , and have gone through some of it before. 
Jes (OREL) says:
Neuromatch   have aiemd to be open source

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
and re JOPRO, yes, I want it ultimately to become a fundable organization. It will not be immediate but in the future. 
Jes (OREL) says:
or able to receive grants etc 
10:04

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
thanks 
10:05

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
There are specific reasons as to why OREL is the way it is, and what I can say is that over time I have realized the value and opportunities of it how it is. That's why what I'm doing with JOPRO is separate; I think there is a lot of importance to OREL being structured and operated how it is. 
10:07

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
I still havent figue out what Orel is/does but I guess most companies work behind close doors except for stuf that they want to disseminate 
10:11

Morgan Hough (he/him)
Morgan Hough (he/him) says:
My definition of OREL is a modern natural philosophy lab 
10:12

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
I like how one of the background images in the banner was a decimated house that looked like it got knocked down and fell apart 
Jes (OREL) says:
OMG MORGAN THATS GREAT HAHA 
Jes (OREL) says:
it's like alternative to blue sky thinking 
Jes (OREL) says:
silly skies thinking

## NOTES
Meeting, May 4:

* JoPro -- mentoring and career incubator.

* experience of what/how to write.

* SynBioBeta -- synthetic biology conference -- organoid.


Side projects: protein engineering.

* growth factor open-source. Sleep medicine course.

* NeuroGPT -- paper and model, foundation models for EEG.


Foundation model -- groups that have a lot of data and compute.

* statisticL mechanics perspective: examine weights of models, fine-tune for a purpose (structure that is useful).

* share blog link (Google Doc).


HAI (hay) @ Stanford. Annual report. 100 years of AI report.

* Steve Brunton -- operator methods, symmetries.

* pins to do model selection (living matter lab).

* Mehul -- dataset interest. Paola -- preparation for meetings. Fundings.

* Paola -- meeting with Nick halper. We have a OREL fork of Neuromatch materials (YouTube curriculum, Github).

* slow pods -- paced approach to NM materials.

* human usability for Machine Learning.


Search for meaning of OREL -- natural philosophy lab? Data science and modeling? 

* engineers, managers, others. Want a certain standard, model cards, alternative ways of learning about data.

* funding catechism -- thinking about impact of project.


SIGBOVIK -- blue skies, silly skies thinking.

* absurdism about research, silly questions with real insights.

* importance of bad art.

* organoids -- neuromorphic computing.

Jesse update. NYCWiC (2025 call for volunteers), Oxford events (inclusive gaming). 

* use drones to capture digital landscapes.

* archives of choices and pathways.

* co-design practices for games.


How do you make a health tech product! Unit of creation --> implement. 

* Twisterland -- first attempt at game building. inclusivegaming.notion.site

* challenges in EdTech -- conformation to a specific standard.

* infrastructure for concept-to-market pathway (VR/XR).

* alternative modes of gaming (walking sims).


Making nonlinear problem tractable.

* smaller model -- easier to ID interrpetation.

* feature engineering (DL requires post-hoc work, GLM more interpret design matrix).

* Dynamics AI center (NSF). Unsupervised way to discover governing equations.

Jes (OREL) says:
I think my ucrrent linkedin account might need accss to the OREL lineking page , that way I can post things there. 
Jes (OREL) says:
also for later: we had a SUPER DUPER successful NYCWiC event earlier this year, and their LinkedIn page really helped network and connect, and I want to tyr to do that a bit more with the lab on that platform 
9:28

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
Thanks Himansu, how do I select a reply to  a specific msg in chat? I do not seem to know how to do that 
9:31

I love how Morgan said "for those who may have enough data" to start the discussion heh 
Jes (OREL) says:
that too eh 
9:50

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
Mehul, I think here everyone jumps in the talk 
Paola Di Maio says:
no need to ask permission to speak, it is so polite of you, just find the right moment of pause 
Paola Di Maio says:
I mean, do not interrupt but do not hesitate 
9:51

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
ahhhh 
Jes (OREL) says:
"HAI" 
9:52

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
I canno see a raised hand tho, saw a quick popup saying Mehul would like to speak 
9:52

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
yes they have good reports , and I think they also do the 100 years of AI stuff right? 
9:52

Mehul Arora

oh I was checking out the raise button @paola as @Jes mentioned xD 
9:53

9:53

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
ah, thats why the request to speak went awy @mehul  normally bradley asks if anyone has anything to say but raising hand is alaway a good idea, I think I ll do it 
9:54

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
We do honor the raised hand feature though, if you do want to do so !

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
I'm defintely interested in how to make mindemaps as a general process, and the software abilities (or rather, hardships) in doing so. We've talekd about that some in the lab before. 
Jes (OREL) says:
I don't think Neuromatch has "OREL" lab material, but rather, we've discussed Neuromatch material , and have gone through some of it before. 
Jes (OREL) says:
Neuromatch   have aiemd to be open source

and re JOPRO, yes, I want it ultimately to become a fundable organization. It will not be immediate but in the future. 
Jes (OREL) says:
or able to receive grants etc 
10:04

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
thanks 
10:05

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
There are specific reasons as to why OREL is the way it is, and what I can say is that over time I have realized the value and opportunities of it how it is. That's why what I'm doing with JOPRO is separate; I think there is a lot of importance to OREL being structured and operated how it is. 
10:07

Paola Di Maio
Paola Di Maio says:
I still havent figue out what Orel is/does but I guess most companies work behind close doors except for stuf that they want to disseminate 
10:11

Morgan Hough (he/him)
Morgan Hough (he/him) says:
My definition of OREL is a modern natural philosophy lab

I like how one of the background images in the banner was a decimated house that looked like it got knocked down and fell apart 
Jes (OREL) says:
OMG MORGAN THATS GREAT HAHA 
Jes (OREL) says:
it's like alternative to blue sky thinking 
Jes (OREL) says:
silly skies thinking 
10:13

## TRANSCRIPT  
0:02     
hello hello Hi how are you good I'm currently like walking to a a cafe I'm     
0:09     
gonna sit down at but I'm in I in Boston today so how are you all right I'm doing     
0:19     
well there's Pocky     
0:25     
hello yeah we'll talk about Jesse's trip to Oxford in a a little bit I'm     
0:31     
sure yeah hello     
0:38     
Pocky all right so hello     
0:47     
Morgan just looking for a place to quiet place to set up here oh     
0:56     
yeah me too yeah I'm down in San Jose     
1:02     
okay great welcome uh so this week was gck     
1:11     
decisions and so we had three uh people across oh hello     
1:20     
mahul we got three people across two or two projects uh and I'm including dorm in     
1:26     
this and I'll show you some slides in a minute uh to give you a rough idea of how uh the mentorship is organized or     
1:35     
our organizations intercept so so I've invited uh two of well I've invited all     
1:42     
of our uh gso people here we have two today actually hansu is uh a mentor for     
1:50     
the diva worm uh projects and then Pocky and mahul are dvo worm gck students so     
1:57     
congratulations to Pocky and mahul and uh Jesse and hansu are co-mentors on     
2:05     
this project and I'm the mentor so this is Graff networks we also got one student for     
2:11     
open source sustainability um yes and then we have     
2:18     
two people who want to work on projects who didn't get selected uh but they will     
2:23     
be nevertheless participating in our open source meetings and in some of the other things we're doing     
2:30     
yes so it looks like congratulations are in order we're getting people in the chat congratulating each other yes yeah     
2:39     
congratulations awesome yeah so people who weren't selected don't feel bad you know it's     
2:46     
pretty competitive I thought that everyone's application was pretty good you know we just had uh we had to make     
2:53     
some rankings and we got as many spots as we got so um and then you know will so so this     
3:00     
is the community period until uh I think the end of the month of May and then     
3:07     
we'll continue on with the coding period which is where you do you know you get down to the technical aspects of this so     
3:15     
um and then we'll be starting our open source meetings um I don't know about     
3:20     
next week maybe next week we may have to schedule for a different time but we'll start either next week or the week after     
3:28     
and we'll do every week uh where we kind of talk about you know we'll give updates independent of any of     
3:36     
our other meetings you know we can get in dive into some technical details we can then talk about some problems and     
3:43     
we'll have like a feature uh sometimes I'll usually present sometimes Jesse has something to present on you know like     
3:50     
some Topic in project management or in uh open source or something like that so     
3:58     
last year it was pretty good uh we had a number of topics and those are all up on YouTube if you're     
4:04     
interested in seeing we have an open- Source Channel there so and I know that     
4:09     
mahul and Pocky are from uh from the dorm project and of course hansu is     
4:15     
familiar with both the orthogon lab projects and the DM projects and so um     
4:22     
you know this is this is uh Pocky and mahul you know you can we're going to     
4:29     
review your things in the Monday meeting DEA War Monday meeting but we'll also try to do things in the Friday meeting     
4:35     
so you might want to make those as well because there's some interesting things going on there of course you can always     
4:40     
catch up on those via YouTube it's it's fine so welcome to the summer and uh     
4:47     
this is our gck summer this is our I think for myself it's something like my seventh     
4:55     
gck as a mentor or eighth I can't remember which um and you know I've done     
5:02     
a lot of different projects in that time I've mentored people uh you know from a     
5:08     
lot of different universities uh on you know basically     
5:13     
trying to complete a project over the course of the summer so you know you're     
5:18     
in good hands uh and then Jesse of course has been around for a couple years where     
5:23     
he's mentored and you know done some mentoring things and of course he has his own organization     
5:30     
uh and then you know we have um hansu who has done gck twice he did gck once     
5:37     
in the orthogonal lab and then the other time he did it in the dorm project so     
5:42     
actually hansu worked on both of these projects so there's the um graph neural     
5:48     
networks project and he worked on that last year and then the open source Community sustainability project he     
5:54     
worked on that two years ago in 2022 so he's well suited to be a mentor and so I     
6:00     
would turn to him if you have questions but we have three as I mentioned we have three uh mentees so     
6:08     
the D.A worm group we have which you know the D.A worm group meets on Mondays at 2 pm UTC which is 10: a.m. eastern     
6:15     
time North America and we have two people in that group we have mahul Aurora and py     
6:22     
Balia and uh mul's project proposal title was hyper Divo graph and picky's     
6:31     
uh uh proposal title was graph neural networks so you know uh I got a question     
6:37     
last night in the chat uh about you know contacting each other and sharing each     
6:43     
other's proposals and I say to that absolutely please do please share     
6:49     
resources please communicate because we don't want to overlap because it's the same basic project we don't want to um     
6:57     
do the same work twice you know we don't want to reinvent the wheel we don't want to go off in different directions we     
7:03     
want to be complimentary and the way to do that of course is to attend the meetings but also to make sure that     
7:10     
you're you know if there common resources you can use that's great you know if there's a common     
7:16     
toolbox uh sometimes if you you say I'm going to take this part of the problem and I'm going to take this part of the     
7:23     
problem and it benefits both of our projects then that's good too you know just as long as we're getting something     
7:29     
done at the end of the summer so congratulations to mahul and Pocky and then in the orthoga web uh we     
7:39     
have Sara basala and she got uh did a very good presentation in this meeting a     
7:45     
couple weeks ago on open- Source Community sustainability modeling that     
7:50     
using large language models and agent based models so kind of a combination of the two and so uh congratulations to     
7:58     
Sara and this is the project open source Community sustainability which we've been working on for a couple years     
8:05     
similar to the graph metal networks project you we've we we get um students     
8:11     
coming in they complete something over the summer and we try you know in the     
8:16     
last couple years we've kind of picked we've kind of gotten a student to do the work and then they the next year another     
8:24     
student will pick up the ball and move forward on it and we try to build you know sort of a multi-year trajectory     
8:32     
using that kind of an approach so you know there there things we have     
8:37     
repositories that you can uh explore uh you know that are existing so     
8:45     
I I encourage you both to go to those repositories to explore what's been done     
8:51     
and then to contribute to that repository Fork that repository contribute to it you know put up set up     
8:57     
your uh directories set up your files and so forth so congratulations to our     
9:05     
three official gso um mentees we also have two other people     
9:11     
who applied who didn't get selected for the program but want to work on their projects so Adama qua who also presented     
9:19     
in the meeting on her work on developing an immersive VR learning environment for     
9:25     
hyperfocus so this is this hyperfocus stuff in VR where you know it's it's     
9:30     
sort of manipulating attention using VR and the affordances of VR and that's     
9:36     
something that you know again this is a great project um and I look forward     
9:43     
to I look forward to seeing what comes out of that and then sham     
9:48     
Sony is also interested in the open source sustainability project and you know again you know we'll work in this     
9:56     
is that project I just mentioned so this has been going on for a while uh you know there are all sorts of we     
10:02     
did some things with active inference we've done some things with uh reinforcement learning and so you know     
10:11     
she's going to work in that space and I'm looking forward to getting some more work done in that     
10:17     
area so like I said we have um this is the community period for gach the next     
10:23     
three weeks so the point of this period is to get acquainted with the resources     
10:29     
of your community and so I'll show you in a minute how this is organized but     
10:35     
both Diva worm and the orthogonal research lab projects are administered     
10:40     
sort of officially and unofficially by the orthogonal research and education so we have a YouTube channel     
10:48     
and you know it's the orthogonal research and education laboratory uh YouTube channel we have a lot of videos     
10:55     
on there one of the playlists is openhouse and project views so in 2022     
11:01     
we started putting these openhouse videos up and this is like a set of     
11:06     
videos I kind of go over different projects go over the state of different projects and this is an constantly     
11:13     
evolving set of resources so we have um you know we kind of go over all of the     
11:19     
projects we've done all of the themes that we're involved in and you know so     
11:25     
we have a lot of different resources here there are some resources specifically to Google summer of code     
11:30     
you might want to check out we also have some I think there's I don't see it in this screenshot but there's some there's     
11:37     
some work on VR that that is interesting there's also this uh state of Open     
11:43     
Source and gck activities for 2022 which is a bit dated but it's still     
11:49     
relevant so there are a lot of and then the dvoor group update that was actually from I think 2022 so you know these are     
11:57     
all things that you can find on this um YouTube channel and get a sense of     
12:04     
what's going on uh and and so the D.A worm group also has a YouTube channel     
12:10     
and we also have videos we don't have Pro state of the project updates there     
12:16     
but we just have video thematic videos as well as our meetings so you can go to those and in Additionally the orthogonal     
12:23     
research and education lab has a channel for open source in which we have a lot     
12:30     
of our meetings from last year where we talked about different topics and we'll be revisiting those topics but those are     
12:36     
all good resources to get into the community speaking of which our complete     
12:42     
org uh the way this is structured is that we have the orthoga lab which is on the left and that's really an     
12:49     
administrative uh unit for a number of things a number of projects under underlying that a number of working     
12:57     
groups and one of those work groups is Diva worm uh now D.A worm isn't really     
13:02     
core to what we're doing because dorm is also in involved with the openworm     
13:08     
foundation so if you're uh a diva worm mentee you were given some uh Community     
13:17     
materials for openworm so I expect you to kind of explore what openworm is     
13:22     
about and that is where you know we're looking at simulating the uh nematode     
13:28     
celegans so a lot of the resources I gave you are projects that involve biological     
13:34     
modeling of different types so movement biophysics um     
13:41     
connectomics uh uh um     
13:48     
electrophysiology and different things like that so you'll see those video I I sent out like uh a set of resources     
13:56     
related to the open worm openhouse which was a long time ago now but I think it's still kind of instructive of where the     
14:03     
you know the sort of the points the access points to that project are um so D.A worm is a part of that     
14:10     
it's the development of the Worm but we also do other things in D.A worm as well     
14:16     
um and so that that's one sort of community that you're in the other community and the community for uh our     
14:24     
mentees through the uh orthogonal research lab proper is the orthogonal     
14:29     
research lab and so this is a group where you know we work on different projects like I said we work online we     
14:36     
don't have like a physical location where we have people we all work kind of independently of uh a a headquarters but     
14:45     
we do you know we try to do our work on different projects and we try to do those projects sort of fractionally so     
14:52     
we do them when we have time we're based in the slack the orthogonal slack we     
14:58     
have a website we have a YouTube channel and so forth so you're in this orthoga lab and these resources here the reason     
15:06     
I brought this up is because these are useful we're kind of getting a sense of all the things that are going on in the     
15:12     
orthogo ab and uh even Diva worm and so     
15:17     
uh we haven't built as much connection between the openworm project and the um     
15:25     
orthogonal lab as I would like with the evil Worm but it's I try to integrate     
15:30     
dorm things into that as much as I can so I just wanted to give an overview     
15:36     
of that um I think that's you know it's kind of a cursory overview next time     
15:41     
I'll maybe get a little bit deeper into some of the things that we're doing community wise um and you know we we     
15:49     
always try to keep commun because we're a distributed group in both cases we always try to keep Community online like     
15:55     
this where you know we have videos I have other content where we can engage     
16:01     
with some of the research themes okay Paul lots of people today     
16:08     
I'll watch on YouTube it's it's fine you would like to do that but hello     
16:13     
paa how are you okay so yeah we had a lot of things     
16:21     
in the CH chat here let me just go over do we have a question     
16:27     
or hello oh hello no just I I seem to be     
16:32     
experiencing some network issues today but thank you for the welcome and I     
16:39     
missed I think it's small part of the introduction I'll cover up that and if     
16:45     
anyone has any questions regarding the project you can reach out to okay that sounds good     
16:52     
yeah so yeah uh let's see mahul and Pocky aren't in the orth slack and I may     
16:59     
send you an invite to that as well because I think that would be maybe useful uh for you know some of the open     
17:06     
source meeting stuff um yeah so yeah we uh so Mah and S     
17:14     
having internet issues so is Paul that's fine uh Jess says by the way if anyone     
17:19     
here has Twitter LinkedIn or other social handles they would like to be tagged in let me know I making some     
17:26     
posts today later this weekend R sock and other lab     
17:32     
projects okay well yes how are you thank you for that     
17:49     
yes ah sham is here hello sham okay uh so Sara said here's my     
17:57     
LinkedIn so that's in response respons to Jesse's message and then Jesse says I     
18:02     
second that I wish we had more funding slots to give out of course and I'm super glad that we will have others in     
18:08     
the cohort at the summer to work on these projects will gave his Twitter handle Pocky said thanks Jess here's my     
18:15     
Twitter we have people on there so this is the orthogonal research uh web page     
18:23     
uh this is where we have a lot of our resources we have a lab introduction which just is created um this is where     
18:31     
we have uh this is kind of out of date in a lot of ways uh we have some things     
18:36     
that were updated last in June of 22 but just Lab news and things like that um     
18:42     
but this is uh so that's that then we have people and collaboration so we have     
18:49     
some links there we have our different sub projects we have a link to dorm the     
18:55     
openworm foundation so we do some things with simulating Biology we're also interested in doing things     
19:00     
with organoids we have this neuro AI category which is this representational brains     
19:07     
and phenotype group cognition Futures the representational brains and phenotype group is a group that is     
19:13     
interested in agent based modeling um and things like     
19:18     
that uh open science open source we have a number of resources there we do things     
19:25     
with informatics which include cybernetics Society ethics and Tech and     
19:30     
some things on data open data and data reuse we have people you know where you     
19:37     
can find out you know kind of our list of current members and alumni and you know we have some other     
19:43     
links here we have this educa set of Education links so Jesse runs an     
19:49     
organization called joepro and this is a intern organization so we have a link to     
19:55     
the joepro internships but there's this joepro site that he runs as well let's     
20:01     
see it here but it's joepro dog and so this is something Jesse runs in you know     
20:08     
with respect to internships and managing that sort of thing we also have oh go     
20:15     
ahead um basically there's I'm I'm making a small organization that's     
20:20     
around one uh certain research projects conition Futures is sort of like the     
20:26     
original um case study sorry that case study of     
20:34     
um uh we're doing we're developing very specific     
20:39     
um projects uh that are oriented towards     
20:44     
getting early career researchers experience in very Niche like itary     
20:50     
spaces so half of joepro is sort of this um uh like a research incubator and the     
20:57     
other half is a sort of mentor or career incubator where we kind of have a     
21:02     
holistic take on you know how does someone navigate this spis of doing like     
21:08     
Innovative or more Progressive or like maybe less less standard uh Pathways to     
21:13     
doing research that like you know is is actually pushing the ball forward in ways that maybe other places aren't     
21:19     
interested in doing research so yeah it's sort of a two two-sided organization or or two parts     
21:25     
to a macro organization that's slowly in development um and there's there's there's a cool there's a few cool things     
21:31     
I mentioned um that tie into my experience at the inclusive gaming conference um at Oxford that I was that     
21:37     
but we'll get to that later on so a small picture of jopro and yeah I guess we need to update that link it could     
21:42     
just be to the main oh yeah the main Joe proo page probably but do that later     
21:47     
okay yeah uh yeah so that thank you Jesse for that we also have our Google     
21:53     
summer of code interns uh so this is a page if you're interested in knowing kind of uh previous year's projects we     
22:00     
have some links here to that we also have some links to some of our     
22:05     
sponsoring organizations so like I said we uh the D.A worm people are part of     
22:12     
openworm but they're also part of warthog research lab orthogonal research lab and dorm are sponsored by     
22:20     
incf which is the international neuro informatics coordinating facility so what they're interested in is uh you     
22:27     
know taking Neuroscience data and making it more accessible or figuring out     
22:33     
standards for Neuroscience data and so we're we're kind of affiliated with that in the Neuroscience sense openworm is     
22:41     
really about you know has strong ties to this sort of neuroinformatics approach     
22:47     
uh you know dorm of course works with a lot of secondary data and the orthogonal lab we work with a lot of topics related     
22:54     
to the brain related to cognitive science and with open data so there are     
23:00     
a lot of sort of you know sort of uh uh not obvious ties to incf and of     
23:08     
course they sponsor our gck activity so I just wanted to mention     
23:14     
that um so yes we have a lot of information here we have our previous     
23:21     
interns so our history with GSA goes back to 2017 and that was in the diva worm group     
23:28     
and you know so we've been working on sort of different topics in machine learning we've been working on agent     
23:34     
based modeling we've been working on other types of uh topics like creating     
23:41     
visualizations for probably I guess it's been eight years now or seven years so     
23:46     
this is if you're interested in kind of the history of our involvement in Google suur code it's at this     
23:54     
site so then we also have uh we're involved in the neurom magic Academy     
23:59     
which is uh an a summer school that's virtual and they run a couple of     
24:05     
different uh courses they run a computational neuroscience course they     
24:10     
run a deep learning course and this year they're running a neuro AI course so neuro AI is the sort of the merger of     
24:18     
Neuroscience and artificial intelligence and this is an emerging field we actually sort of do some work in that     
24:25     
area I mean that's what I'm classifying some of these projects as but you know this is where you can learn about like     
24:32     
kind of the field in three weeks and you learn some techniques and I do mentoring     
24:38     
through there as well uh We've we've been involved in that in the past and this summer you know all the materials     
24:44     
are available open and online so this summer I might actually go through some neuromag academy uh lessons from the     
24:51     
neuro AI course in the meeting here because last year we did that and it was very useful to people so go through some     
24:59     
of those materials and uh so that you know that's something that you might be interested in as well uh we have our     
25:06     
slack team links so we have our aoga lab slack some of you are in that the DOR     
25:12     
people are not so if you want to get an invite you can go to our website orthogonal research. weebly.com     
25:19     
go to uh this education tab slack teams     
25:24     
and you can get an invite just by clicking on orthogonal lab Slack and if you want to get into the open room slack     
25:30     
if you're not in that slack then there's an invite for that as well then we have our topical Discord     
25:37     
server so if you're interested in and you know this is not required but this is just some of the things that we have     
25:43     
some of the resources we have um there's a cou there are a couple of discords that we run for the lab that are sort of     
25:50     
you know specialized uh servers so we have the big unfinished ideas Discord which is     
25:57     
related to teach Ing and some other educational things we have the principles of bits to matter to mind     
26:03     
Discord which is about VR and XR so virtual reality and extended reality and     
26:10     
then we have computational critical periods which is uh about critical periods in development so we do a lot of     
26:17     
things with developmental science not just in the evor but in the orthogonal lab as well and this is on some things     
26:24     
we've been doing on critical periods so we have a lot of resources in the Community to to go go through and talk     
26:31     
about and digest I don't expect you to go to Every community resource but I'm giving you sort of an outline of what we     
26:38     
have available uh we yeah we have other things here we have our medium which is     
26:44     
a a Blog so I'm not sure if this year's um gso requires students to have a     
26:52     
weekly blog update well one of the things we've done in the past is that you know the students would have like a     
26:58     
weekly report that they write up in blog form they'd set up like a medium like this and they were like a     
27:06     
github.io and they'd have a stub for each week so each week you would go through your work and you would um you     
27:13     
know kind of make notes and then youd write them up as a report and then in the meetings we would come together and     
27:20     
you would kind of walk through that report saying what you know what have I did what do I what did I do this week     
27:27     
what did I not accomplish that I wanted to accomplish what did I do well what did I     
27:32     
succeed at and what did I fail at or what couldn't I do and so if you break     
27:38     
it down like that you can then answer all the questions that you have sometimes uh you can't but you make a     
27:45     
note of it you say uh okay so this week I did X Y and Z I wanted to do you know     
27:52     
some other things I couldn't do them I may have to wait on some things uh what I you know if I was     
27:59     
successful on some things then that leads to maybe my work next week what am I going to do next week and that might     
28:06     
lead to some new new opportunities or it might lead me in my next steps and you know so you can break     
28:12     
everything down like that and write it up so I encourage people to do that if that's the way they want to work if     
28:18     
that's not useful for you I don't think it's required but um you know it's it's     
28:24     
always been useful I think to a number of students who have triy it that way     
28:30     
but anyways this is our medium so we have a medium for the lab and the lab     
28:35     
has uh you know a lot of news that we need to get out and let people know what we're doing so we have a lot of uh if     
28:41     
you want to explore this this is at medium.com slal group and so um this is     
28:48     
a good resource to find out some of the things that have been going on in the lab so we've attended a lot of     
28:54     
conferences we have a lot of conference updates and Conference summaries here we     
29:00     
have other types of updates on our our research activities so last year's     
29:05     
activities were summarized we have some special topics identifying toxic     
29:11     
academic workplaces we have some themes from these meetings we had uh one set of     
29:17     
discussions on causality last year we had another set of discussions on physical Computing so we've done a lot     
29:23     
of like these reports on the things that we're doing so um you know this is but     
29:29     
but I also want to give students and anyone else who wants to the opportunity to write a feature for this medium so if     
29:38     
you're interested in writing about some research topic or some topic of interest     
29:43     
uh professional topic of Interest or something that happened in the meetings that you really wanted to follow up on     
29:50     
or something else you know this is the place to do it and it gives you practice in writing and it gives you practice     
29:58     
this in composition putting together you know a report for people to read so this     
30:03     
is I want to I'm going to I'm going to pitch about writing and the importance of it but if you want to go through that     
30:08     
blog post first we can so it's up to you yeah so I I just wanted to say that this     
30:13     
is sort of the structure of a blog post you know you have some images in it you have some text and you try to get the     
30:20     
point across and you know it's don't worry about being efficient just you know write it out we can edit it for for     
30:28     
you and you can have something that you can point to on your resume or you know it can lead to maybe a paper down the     
30:34     
line but it's it's an opportunity to get things out there and to organize your thoughts so that's that's all I want to     
30:41     
say about the blog and and largely the the uh website in general     
30:48     
so yeah um and just just to briefly follow up on that like     
30:55     
um getting experience at how to write with things like that in different     
31:01     
audiences or like if you if you're thinking about oh I'd like to make you know a small post on like social media     
31:09     
or or LinkedIn talking about being accepted and then I like to write a write a you know like we we can we're     
31:15     
open to helping you I guess there's no particular requirements this year for it but let's say for example you just got     
31:22     
accepted to this program um and that's a great thing Sobe you want to talk about that on LinkedIn and maybe you want to     
31:27     
write write more about your project or your experience uh in a specific blog post and you can talk to us about that     
31:35     
whole process because we want to help with like professional development and the skills and the writing how do you     
31:40     
communicate what you're doing both to other people um you know obviously to us     
31:45     
but also uh to like to Professional Network which other things too and     
31:50     
that's part of what we offer in in this summer and that's why it's really cool and same is true for that's why I     
31:57     
encourage people to be of like the co-art for the lab in general because we will uh help help develop all those     
32:03     
important things yeah so yeah I mean I guess the     
32:09     
point is is that gach isn't just about working on code it's about there's a     
32:15     
community period of course which is where we're at right now and that's you know just getting familiar with the     
32:20     
community an open source Community how your organization that you're a part of     
32:26     
operates you know the activities that they're doing and just you know spending time thinking about that getting     
32:33     
familiar with it you don't have to do you know that much but you know it's     
32:39     
it's s sort of an immersion for the rest of the summer and then once you get into that you you understand kind of what's     
32:45     
going on and uh I encourage people to you know explore things ask questions     
32:51     
whatever um you know in in the case of openworm we've had people who you know they might want to find out if if     
32:58     
there's you know if there's an open data set that someone has that they might use in their project or if you have like in the     
33:05     
orthog web we have a lot of resources and are obvious and so if you need something for a project to find out who     
33:11     
to ask and uh you know get those resources in order so you're you're     
33:17     
exploring your community you're finding out what's there you're finding the resources you're you know kind of we're     
33:22     
going to talk about open source throughout the summer but just kind of getting your feet at in that area and     
33:28     
then also getting ready for the uh coding period knowing what Community Resources are available and so forth now     
33:36     
I also encourage you in the community period of course to get ready for the coding period get your things ready uh     
33:43     
if you need to set up tool boxes or if you need to um evaluate maybe two     
33:49     
different rival approaches that you're thinking of using then that's the time to do it as well because when we hit the coding     
33:55     
period we have a limited amount of time and the coding period is going to be very um it's going to be very tight in     
34:03     
terms of what you can and can't do each week so I don't want you to like feel like you you know I don't want you to     
34:10     
spend like uh 60 hours a week on trying to figure out something we know we we     
34:15     
can talk from week to week about how to accomplish things if it turns out that what you what you proposed is going to     
34:22     
be too big then our Pro you know the whole point of gach is to sort to figure out     
34:28     
how to make a project happen without sort of overextending yourself but you     
34:35     
need to have practice at that to know how to do that effortlessly so a lot of gso can be about you know kind of     
34:43     
finding the right size unit of work for each week to get something done at the end so we've had this you know     
34:50     
discussion many times over many years where you know we've had people who you know they propos something that's you     
34:56     
know initially look great and then they may run into technical hurdles or things     
35:02     
might be impractical and that's fine we just need to know on a regular basis if     
35:08     
those things are are workable or not so that's why we have our weekly meetings that's why we you know kind of get     
35:15     
familiar with the community so we know kind of what we have work to work with going in and then having these sort of     
35:22     
evaluations each week where we say okay where are we what are what are we doing     
35:28     
what are we not doing well what do we need to maybe change what can we do in the next week and then you know at the     
35:35     
end of this program which is at the end of August you know we want to have some     
35:40     
sort of finished product to turn in and so if you're working on something outside of gso you know that timeline     
35:47     
isn't as tight but you still want to have that kind of model where you want     
35:52     
to you don't want to waste a lot of time you don't want to waste a lot of your time on a project so you want to know     
35:58     
kind of you know on a week-by-week basis where am I going with this what's my     
36:04     
progress how can I improve things how do I do I need to Res scope things do I     
36:09     
need to change how they're you know this sort of the size of what I'm trying to accomplish maybe I you know maybe I     
36:15     
found something that's really interesting that is not in the direction I originally     
36:21     
proposed uh you can actually we can recope in that way too so if there's     
36:27     
something that's really interesting that you want to do you know we may or may not be able to do that but but we have     
36:32     
to talk about it so that's why we want to get familiar with our community that's why we want to     
36:39     
have a good handle on the resources that we have so we can do those kinds of     
36:44     
things okay so that I think that's all for the community stuff I wanted to look in the chat here we have uh some more     
36:52     
things okay so we have some discussions about LinkedIn and uh okay Nick Wick     
36:58     
which is something Jesse's going to update us on and and their LinkedIn presence um and then oh about the jitsy     
37:07     
yeah so jitsy allows for certain things and not allows for certain things okay so uh that's good all right     
37:14     
so that's all I'm going to talk about with respect to the community so welcome again to our gak uh mentees for this     
37:20     
year all right so I don't know if uh Morgan or Jesse wanted to I know that Morgan has     
37:27     
his camera on and Jesse said he want to give an update so well I'm just glad I found a a place     
37:35     
that's not typing in really loud trance music you know um but uh yeah     
37:43     
congratulations everyone I'm really exciting to yeah can't wait to see     
37:49     
these projects coming to life um uh update this week well I I was back in my     
37:56     
hometown uh taking taking care of my aunt so um I     
38:03     
haven't uh so I've been kind of distracted uh but this I mean San Jose     
38:10     
right now getting ready for sin bioa um so this is a big synthetic     
38:17     
biology conference um that     
38:23     
uh that's been running now for quite a number of years     
38:29     
um and yeah really looking to connect with cerebral     
38:34     
organoids people as well as you know some of the um kind of side projects on     
38:41     
protein engineering especially as it relates to producing growth factors that we use for     
38:48     
organite development so we're looking for much cheaper ways to produce these growth     
38:56     
factors as one the kind of most expensive reagents in the organoid     
39:02     
culture process yeah um and yeah I think     
39:08     
three of us from Celsius are going to be here     
39:14     
um so we're we're gonna we're going to divide and conquer and be yeah they're     
39:22     
they're well I should say the the kids the kids in the group are planning to post lots of on     
39:32     
Instagram I'm the old fogy on on LinkedIn oh     
39:37     
yeah but I think Elliot's actually think     
39:42     
somehow got on a gen Z panel and he he feels that he's too old for that and I'm     
39:48     
like you guys are all my kids [Laughter]     
39:54     
age time so looking forward to it and um     
40:01     
uh yeah there's a sleep course sleep medicine course     
40:09     
that's going on today that um that I'm also going to be at least     
40:16     
proly attending um luckily recordings are going to be made but I'm really looking forward to that and um uh I want     
40:25     
to just mention EXC me     
40:30     
um H had posted the neuro GPT so um and     
40:37     
I don't know if he put a link but um the the big update here the the paper had     
40:43     
come out and I posted it I forget when but some sometime earlier this year but     
40:50     
now the model is available um so this is this is of     
40:55     
Interest again for for each people um USC's produced this Foundation     
41:03     
model for EG and um it' be really interesting to start     
41:11     
looking at ways to utilize that um I haven't checked slack but     
41:20     
there's been a few a few posts um again I I kind of catching up from being on     
41:29     
the East Coast any might might have some more there okay that sounds great yeah there     
41:36     
are a lot of events and we talk about them in the slack so U there there are a lot of virtual events and and events     
41:43     
going on like community and in the orthogonal lab slack we of course talk a     
41:48     
lot about different types of AI models talked about uh large language models     
41:55     
and other types of data science or oriented models and then in the D.A worm group we're more interested in sort of     
42:01     
graph neural networks and uh deep learning and things like that so we we have this kind of broad interest in uh     
42:10     
modeling especially in like AI type models machine learning type models language models things like that um so     
42:17     
this is something that we'll probably have in our open source meetings this summer with respect to some modeling     
42:23     
issues and then of course in dor is uh how all well hansu paky and meul know     
42:30     
maybe Jesse and Morgan as well that we do a lot of things with um you know     
42:35     
different types of biological models more generally so outside of AI and     
42:40     
that's something that I think for the graph networks project in particular you know something keep your eye on on some     
42:47     
of how some of those models work so I think uh people have been attending the meetings the last couple weeks we've     
42:53     
talked about different types of modeling platforms that EX exist in biological modeling they're very different from the     
43:00     
sort of networks or the neural networks and other things that you're using in uh Ai and machine learning     
43:07     
so it's just always good to keep your mind open to these different ways of     
43:12     
doing things and you know what the results     
43:18     
are so yeah thank you Morgan for that update um looks like we had some more discussion in this in the chat about     
43:26     
LinkedIn uh I don't know I'm not a big LinkedIn user so I don't know um and     
43:31     
there's a archive paper here this is on oh neurog GPT so this neurog GTP yeah     
43:41     
so this is the paper much about it yeah sorry oh yeah yeah there's a there's a     
43:46     
I'll drop a link for the the hugging face hugging face for the mall yes     
43:52     
please do I think that would be good um so yeah that that's the other thing too     
43:57     
is that you know we want to try to get it I think this summer we're going to try to go more in the direction of going     
44:03     
to places like hugging face uh now the D.A worm models we have models there     
44:08     
already on hugging face so we have that or on hugging face and then we have our models in the orthoga lab which I think     
44:16     
for some of the things we're doing this summer with the open source sustainability we might also try to put     
44:21     
some of those on hugging face depending on you know what what part of the model we actually want to publish but I think     
44:28     
that would because that's a a nice Community for people to sort of embrace     
44:33     
and get your models out there that people will start using them because I mean you we put them on GitHub but     
44:38     
GitHub is um you have to pull people's attention to GitHub whereas hugging face     
44:45     
there is more of a community aspect so this is the hugging face model here for     
44:51     
narrow GPT that's has been published in then the archive paper which is a little older um and this Foundation model     
44:59     
aspect of for EG data so of course the foundation models I've talked about um     
45:05     
before but I don't know if anyone has a good definition of foundation models I don't know Morgan does or oh you're     
45:12     
muted I just think of it as you know for the the the the groups     
45:19     
that have a enough data yeah yeah and and you know     
45:27     
and I think it's interesting sorry I think my watch is speaking     
45:35     
um I think there's some interesting things in terms of you know what what     
45:40     
does constitute enough data that from a kind of statistical physics standpoint     
45:46     
yeah you know and and that just you know the Weight Watchers package on on piie     
45:52     
um you know looking at that in terms of you know what     
46:00     
umam examining weights of of large language models I think is really     
46:06     
interesting especially with the then with the the secondary kind of     
46:13     
like lauras and things like that like now now you want to fine-tune     
46:19     
it what what again what's happening to the weights in these PL tuned um um     
46:25     
models uh uh yeah anyway but but this is this you know     
46:32     
there's it's it's obviously applying it in a different problem here in the time     
46:37     
time domain um or frequency domain of EG as     
46:43     
opposed to to language so um uh I think it's reasonable to call     
46:50     
this a foundation yeah but I think of it that as as the term of being used as a model     
46:58     
that you then then F tune for something else right that that like large language     
47:04     
models are just capture capture some structure that     
47:10     
then is actually useful in a bunch of other domaines yeah but I I don't know I'm not sure who     
47:18     
we would check with to check our vocabulary Stanford um oh so     
47:25     
Stanford hey I found out that Stanford's group is called Hay oh okay it's a human     
47:32     
artificial intelligence even though it looks it looks like how yeah uh from from 2001 but     
47:42     
um they they do an annual report so I think they talked about     
47:50     
their did you know did a presentation on their annual report um in terms of of maybe someone     
47:58     
who can give us definitions okay but I I I wanted to say that Steve Steve Brunton     
48:05     
I I I dropped two uh YouTube videos Steve Brunton did a nice overview of     
48:12     
uh the various courses that he does at you know Dynamics a.org yeah and and     
48:21     
cover you know he kind of put pins and and oper her     
48:28     
methods um in a kind of overview together with um symmetries and     
48:36     
and what he's potentially going to do new courses on right yeah and um that     
48:46     
that was really interesting uh him talking about that     
48:51     
and I really want to revisit that in terms of um the the Stanford hay lecture     
48:58     
from the the chair of mechanical engineering the way in which she used     
49:05     
pins um to do model selection I thought     
49:10     
was really interesting um she's that's the living matter lab that's at Stanford all right     
49:18     
um I'm blanking on her name but I think her last name is co like C hu L anyway     
49:24     
that's right but but then also glazers group did um had a an overview of open     
49:33     
Virtual tissue and but what was nice was an overview of of other packages     
49:41     
that relate to it there other packages that that focus on particular subdomains of     
49:47     
that and yeah that that was nice again nice overview to capture you know the     
49:55     
different software packages in the and what their strengths what their strengths     
50:01     
were okay that's great um so we had I think mahul wanted to say something we     
50:07     
also had some discussions in the chat about like there was actually H Manu had     
50:13     
a comment about how you not only need data but also compute for your models so     
50:20     
that for people who do Foundation models you know they have the compute and we for example don't necessarily the     
50:26     
compute so but yeah so I guess uh I don't know what what did you want to say     
50:34     
mul uh hi Bradley I actually didn't um mean to interrupt I was just like raising hand uh by mistake like I was     
50:41     
checking it out when just mention but I I love like how Morgan mentioned that we     
50:46     
need more data and I completely resonate with like just jump to organization which has more data yeah yeah nothing     
50:54     
else oh it's okay um yeah so that's great um thank you for and yeah you can     
51:00     
just kind of jump in I know sometimes it's hard to find a spot but um yeah if     
51:05     
you have something to contribute hi can you hear me yeah yeah hi hi everyone and so I have a     
51:15     
couple of things I wanted to say and I'm also never sure when it could be the right time to save them so I just save     
51:20     
him now okay yeah and I have I have     
51:27     
uh and this is for everyone hello everyone it's the first time I see some here and good to people um and thank you     
51:37     
Bradley for the overview of these so that blog     
51:42     
post if you could share I'm sure I have     
51:49     
it yeah and I have with this Google do where I am     
51:55     
encouraging to the link     
52:00     
and fut reference during the find there's a lot of stuff going around and I'm to     
52:10     
follow and for me it would be useful have something to look at later or even     
52:16     
to prepare for the next me something I want to say before and     
52:29     
and in the I [Music]     
52:36     
have because by now I have answered a couple of things     
52:45     
and question for JZ J you mentioned that you're     
52:50     
serving I don't know discuss this but some of us May     
52:56     
want to find fund because somewhere I     
53:08     
saw I just pasted chat probably got lost the the     
53:14     
aome screenshot is just my talk because I've linked that in the doc and it     
53:19     
refers to the arive paper that was shared with too so in this Google I no     
53:28     
there a couple of questions you don't have to answer now may you may answer later if     
53:33     
you but one is just mention Earth and somewhere in the doation the     
53:41     
Earth is thing that is taking interns and uh but I thought would it be     
53:48     
if it's you know could it could be look for funing and if you look for funing     
53:53     
you probably know better than I because I'm just starting to learn you need to have a registered organization so I     
53:59     
don't know if that is the case it would be nice to see if this project takes off     
54:04     
look fun and oh yes for Bradley mentioned neurom match Academy I     
54:11     
had a meeting with melter this week okay and talking about other things and he     
54:19     
mentioned that they offer courses so I went to the website and I couldn't find     
54:25     
anything related to F the lab so it could be that the courses on M websites     
54:31     
are only uh only a part of them are published and if you could share the     
54:37     
links I'd be very interested to see the intersection between your news lab and new match at some point and     
54:46     
then uh I'm doing so in relation to this     
54:51     
ar ar ar I gave this very little     
55:04     
I'm also trying to visualize the data set which I have     
55:09     
here which is huge and I'm not really good at doing practical things with dat     
55:17     
set so I was wondering is there anyone interested in collaborating helping visualize ni data     
55:25     
set which I've already okay but I'm going to enter another I'm going to make another entry that back specifically for     
55:32     
this purpose in the channel called reservation as pointed out by someone     
55:38     
and then uh the definition about Foundation I love so I'm     
55:44     
going and provide Mak and that's thank you for     
55:51     
listening yeah yeah that's great thank you for the uh and of course people get edit your Google doc or they put things     
55:58     
in there if they want let me I guess um you can at least     
56:06     
comment on it so uh yeah to answer your questions um we don't we don't have     
56:12     
content on their website we we do things kind of with neurom match uh in the in     
56:19     
the lab so the way neurom match works is that their materials that they offer to     
56:25     
anyone any can download the course materials and they generate the course materials you know through a series of     
56:31     
experts and they have a curriculum that they use we can take those and use them     
56:37     
the way we want so we basically review them we you know have our own C of     
56:44     
course content that's separate from what they're doing but it's based on what they're doing so that's the idea of Open     
56:50     
Source you know we're basically making a fork of neurom match and we're using those materials in different ways so we     
56:57     
have I got it yeah yeah that's thank I've seen those courses I've seen three     
57:04     
or four which are open source normally there's a mention says we have taken     
57:10     
this this source so you can tell where so they will be on your GitHub right UHS     
57:17     
are on GI we do have some materials on GitHub but you know we also have like YouTube materials it's hard to because     
57:24     
they're embedded in some of the meetings we gone through some of the talks yeah we yeah and we we we've sort of had sort     
57:32     
of these attempts at going through like neurom match slow pods which if if you gone through any of the mirror match     
57:38     
course where it's extremely condensed three weeks of just rapid fire day long     
57:43     
sessions of stuff and what we've tried to do I don't know if we ever successfully pulled off fully there are     
57:49     
many attempts or many um forms of being interested in these like called slow ODS     
57:55     
we just go through much more slowly in depth the extremely Consolidated extremely compacted     
58:01     
materials um and expand them so that that's that's     
58:08     
probably a little bit more of of what was being mentioned to but like we don't     
58:13     
we don't have like as Bradley said it's not like we wrote material that neurom match incorporated into their stuff     
58:20     
there maybe more the other that's very that's very nice intersection thank you for mentioning yeah and and I think if     
58:26     
the material is very condensed which I haven't actually studied it yet then it would be nice to have     
58:33     
tutorials so like you know also because one of the things that I'm facing is     
58:38     
when I'm teaching uh I I don't teach coding and I don't teach machine     
58:43     
learning but there's a lot of stuff that you try to explain to beginners or to     
58:51     
um people who are not in the langage and they they do benefit from a level of     
58:57     
introduction terminology con so some people cannot just dve straight into the cour they need and do a     
59:06     
foundation preparation get into course they need some tutorials before they can     
59:11     
take for B and so it would be nice to develop those you know so thank you for     
59:16     
for that yeah no problem yeah so that yeah so the other thing about having a     
59:23     
organization that's Grant capable um we don't have that in orthoga lab we     
59:30     
can do this through other means um you know it's just really depending on the Grant I know Jesse talked about using     
59:36     
Joe Pro for that but you know it's it's hard to get you have to have like a board of directors and things they make     
59:42     
it really kind of difficult uh to do that just kind of you know for one Grant so but but we're trying to work out the     
59:50     
infrastructure for things and you know so we can do that if we have the imperative to do it and just on a side     
59:57     
note this is what was the the focus of the meeting     
1:00:05     
with we were discussing how can we partner to Lage ability to because they     
1:00:14     
have like you how work together so we started     
1:00:19     
speaking I I think it would be nice [Music]     
1:00:28     
yeah um yeah so that's good um now we we did say something about data uh so I     
1:00:35     
think nul had a question about data and Paula talked about data so you know we're interested in different types of     
1:00:42     
data sets I think next week I might talk about data sets um and and what's available we have a lot of data sets     
1:00:49     
they're openworm um you know I think when you were applying for your projects I I pointed some I pointed it out some data     
1:00:56     
sets to use for training your models or calibrating your models and then in orag     
1:01:01     
lab we have other data sets that we're interested in working with um you know if we're interested in doing some     
1:01:08     
visualization you know we we that would be nice to kind of talk about uh in the     
1:01:13     
meetings you know if you want to Paula you're welcome to present like informally on some of your ideas and     
1:01:21     
then we can talk about them and how to approach them uh you know then maybe other people become     
1:01:28     
interested in it you know we can have those discussions and yeah so you're     
1:01:34     
talking about the Dead Worm well Diva worm are here I mean we do     
1:01:41     
things in Dil worm data set I am I may not you know like     
1:01:47     
my you know I'm more of the scien yeah     
1:01:52     
yeah General when program and I'm not a machine learning person     
1:01:58     
but I when whenever I look at a machine learning uh computation I need to be     
1:02:04     
able to see it in the human eye I do human visability forar yeah and if that is useful I be     
1:02:12     
happy to give a talk that's more or less all I can talk about but whenever it just s me and I I I yeah well yeah it     
1:02:20     
definitely fits into what we we're interested in so I mean you know I'm I'm interested we're of course interested in     
1:02:26     
the s technical aspects but we're also interested in the usability and visualization and any kind of way that     
1:02:34     
we can so basically a a competitional person like yourself you look at the data as if you can your brain reads data     
1:02:42     
like because you are programmed that way and anyone else doesn't have that in in     
1:02:50     
their mind struggles understanding what this is and and unfortunate or fortunate     
1:02:56     
uh say that um engineers and a lot of managers the funders a lot of people out     
1:03:04     
there W like to understand what the heck is the program doing and how it's doing     
1:03:10     
it and it's at the moment it a level of interation very expensive     
1:03:18     
someone and I think that can be alter to model or through a form of explicit     
1:03:25     
natural language annotation you know and I also develop what they're called learning interfaces     
1:03:31     
so for every uhal function the program you can write annotation explaining that     
1:03:40     
and then it's also a way of learning the so I I can do that and that's that's     
1:03:46     
what I'm interested in so anytime you think there is a slot yeah that would be     
1:03:53     
great that'd be great thank you um yeah so I think yeah so we yeah Jesse     
1:04:01     
had some things to say in the in the slack or in the chat here about yeah we     
1:04:07     
don't have to get in get into it I'll just say there's very it took me a little bit to     
1:04:14     
understand but I would I I I there's very specific reasons why things are the way they are and I I wouldn't change it     
1:04:22     
okay like I think there there's very there's there's very it's just it's a very unique environment that we have     
1:04:29     
here um and I'm not we shouldn't ever you know get funding or whatever future     
1:04:35     
but I there's there's a reason I want Joo to be a certain way and there's a     
1:04:40     
reason why I want like I think this environment is a very special one um as as maybe unconventional as it might seem     
1:04:48     
in some ways I think it's extremely useful and and and a lot of good things     
1:04:53     
come from it um but yeah um I'm hearing someone's     
1:04:58     
background I think it's I'm just gonna that so all right um     
1:05:04     
but no what else do we want to there's we're we're really blazing through today's time yeah I know do what did you     
1:05:13     
want to talk about the rest of the meeting bar we uh well I have a couple thing well I have a couple things to talk about but you can also give an     
1:05:19     
update after I'm going to do a couple things you can give an update and then I'll do another uh feature     
1:05:26     
so let me let me uh share my screen again okay so um I don't know people are     
1:05:34     
familiar with this I I've always like this event and this is something that they have at Carnegie melon every April     
1:05:40     
1 it's like a April Fool's kind of conference based on computer science so     
1:05:46     
and Carnegie melon is like one of the best computer science programs in the United States and they do a lot of     
1:05:53     
really interesting things there but one of the things students do is they do this sort of April fools type conference     
1:06:00     
where they have like these tongue and cheek projects um they call it Sig bovic and     
1:06:06     
they have it every year and this is something that the students put on it's like they develop these projects and     
1:06:13     
it's uh really interesting they have a live stream so on Twitch and they kind of come up with these projects that are     
1:06:20     
sort of useless in the functional sense but like really interesting     
1:06:26     
so uh they have uh this is they call the Sig bovic special interest group on     
1:06:33     
Harry quos bovic which is like just something they made up is an annual     
1:06:38     
multidisciplinary conference specializing in lesser known areas of academic research such as phog gentics     
1:06:46     
uh denotational semantics igeon and freal and worm causality so they come up with things that are kind of maybe like     
1:06:53     
joke ideas maybe they're joke realizations of serious ideas joke     
1:06:59     
realizations of joke ideas and maybe you know like I don't know if any people     
1:07:04     
have heard of the EG Nobel prizes which are like the Nobel prizes but they're     
1:07:10     
kind of things that kind of look trivial or ridiculous but you can actually learn something from approaching a problem     
1:07:16     
that way so this is U they they have this uh at every year at Carnegie melon     
1:07:23     
oh we could do something in the lab like that people are interested I think it's an interesting way to approach problems     
1:07:28     
maybe like a smaller version of that where you come up with a couple slides and you say this is uh this idea that I     
1:07:34     
had it's kind of silly but it maybe gives us some ins lends some insights into things     
1:07:41     
so um now Jesse said something here um yeah so oh Morgan said uh my     
1:07:49     
definition definition of orale is a modern natural philosophy lab well that that okay     
1:07:56     
it's great uh just said I like how One of the background images in the banner was a decimated house it looked like it     
1:08:02     
got knocked down and fell apart I I like that too     
1:08:08     
yeah it's like an alternative to Blue Sky Thinking     
1:08:13     
yeah uh yeah and and I think it's kind     
1:08:19     
of real sort of like uh an inside joke but not not like you have to kind of     
1:08:26     
know a little bit about it but it's I think it's you know I'm not going to try to Define here I understand the     
1:08:32     
questions but like that can be a I'm I'm gonna defer to badly about Demar     
1:08:38     
demarcating what it is or isn't but I think the conference is is is a funny thing I'm glad glad to hear that I     
1:08:45     
mentioned Blue Sky Thinking which I think most might know but like blue sky where like don't worry about the     
1:08:50     
complications just sort of put your ideas out there um which is a really great thing for like brainstorming or     
1:08:57     
you're looking at a problem and so I said I don't I don't I don't want     
1:09:02     
to call it silly guys thing but like I think there is a certain um use like not quite absurdism but just     
1:09:11     
like uh a a labmate and a colleague and and a good friend who isn't always here     
1:09:18     
but is always like ever pres in my discussions for those who don't know him it's Avery uh and a Avery is     
1:09:26     
uh uses this sort of technique sometimes or like uh they they     
1:09:33     
um there it's sort of the understanding the like the importance of bad art like     
1:09:40     
like sometimes when you make art is to be really pristine and precise about like a concept or an idea and being     
1:09:45     
really true like how Fidelity how high fidelity can it be to the idea that you have and how like much technical rare     
1:09:51     
can you put into the crafting of it but there's also like use for bad art as in     
1:09:58     
like art that isn't perfect but is just trying to capture the idea and to share it so um I think there's something to to     
1:10:06     
this that fits with that com idea too yeah yeah go ahead Morgan yeah I just wanted     
1:10:14     
to say I mean you know I I I love the um I love the the search for meaning of of     
1:10:21     
oral but uh but I dropped two link for DARPA webinars and and the second I     
1:10:30     
think is interesting too just in terms of going through um oh what I forget     
1:10:35     
what they call the guy's name what's the guy's name it's um um begins of an age it's     
1:10:45     
the it's the catechism that they have anyway it's like the seven     
1:11:03     
yeah but is is just really interesting in terms of thinking about you're you're     
1:11:10     
thinking about the impact of your of your project and and the the um I I just     
1:11:19     
it's a it's a great process to go through I think for     
1:11:24     
any any project manager which you know we     
1:11:31     
have I think five five new ones here and     
1:11:36     
yeah still still interesting to cover that so this is one one of the DARPA     
1:11:41     
links or is this something else yeah they're just doing these these webinars okay yeah yeah it's so the first ones     
1:11:49     
relates to the art um and Innovation fellowships the um the the specific     
1:11:56     
interest there is that that one of the um uh Innovation fellows is is     
1:12:05     
interested in starting a a cerebral organoids um program okay you know so um     
1:12:16     
I'm still yeah hoping that they'll they'll have a whole organoid track and     
1:12:24     
that that it'll be in the direction of neuromorphic computing     
1:12:30     
um you know like like I think I said last time like you know there's you know like the Indiana     
1:12:37     
project you know there's things you can do with with organoids now that that are     
1:12:44     
still you know somewhat better and at least functional     
1:12:49     
comparison to Quantum Computing yeah yeah um but uh any it's I Dro links in     
1:12:57     
there okay call yeah yeah well thank you Morgan that um yeah so the other thing I     
1:13:05     
wanted to talk about was this uh so aif 2024 is coming up the summer uh we     
1:13:12     
sometimes I mean we we try to participate in it um in different ways     
1:13:17     
this is Art the artificial life conference and one of the things that was brought to my attention is this     
1:13:23     
workshop on evolution criticality and creativity and collective intelligence     
1:13:29     
this might be of some interest to I don't know some of our people in the group uh this is uh it's it's a workshop     
1:13:36     
that's being held as sort of a a parallel session artificial wife I think     
1:13:42     
they're they're based physically in Copenhagen Denmark but they have a virtual component I'm pretty sure     
1:13:49     
because they have a virtual component of the conference uh they're basically looking     
1:13:54     
for sort of exploring New Frontiers and artificial life research across three     
1:14:00     
areas Evolution criticality and creativity and so this is where there     
1:14:05     
you know we we've talked about Collective behavior before we've talked about some of the interdisciplinary     
1:14:12     
aspects of that and this is what this is going to to talk about now I think they're interested in a lot of different     
1:14:18     
sort of areas of uh science from biology to sociology and art to other areas     
1:14:26     
bringing fresh insights into aif conferences and so this is uh that that's their goal they don't have a     
1:14:33     
program they're soliciting papers there's a deadline for abstract submission which is May     
1:14:39     
22nd and then you get a notified on May 31st if that's what they want to um if     
1:14:45     
they want to include that in the conference so I don't know if this is uh I guess the submission is in the form of     
1:14:52     
extended abstracts or research articles the extended abstracts are two pages the     
1:14:57     
research articles are eight pages maximum uh if your contribution is a     
1:15:03     
summary of previous results please specify during the submission process so that yeah this is you know     
1:15:10     
maybe of interest to some people uh the key words here are social evolutionary     
1:15:15     
psychology machine learning and Robotics and collective intelligence criticality in distributed     
1:15:21     
systems and creativity in group dynamics so critic it we've talked about before in the group but that's just a form of     
1:15:29     
complexity and so they they have a lot of different areas so if you're interested you know we can talk about     
1:15:35     
that I have this St here and um it might be of interest yeah could you put that     
1:15:41     
link in the chat the uh to get it I'll put it yeah it's uh let's     
1:15:49     
see Okay Google yeah     
1:15:57     
um yeah that's     
1:16:02     
cool yeah yeah I mean you know we always try for things and see if we get them     
1:16:08     
so um hopefully uh so yeah that's all I had for the updates um now Jesse if you     
1:16:16     
want to give your update yeah I'll I'll try to be quick um     
1:16:22     
I know we're almost know two three     
1:16:27     
FS done um I'm going to briefly mention Nick     
1:16:33     
Wick just because it's been really really great um     
1:16:38     
and uh then I'll talk about the inclusive gaming event Oxford which is phenomenal it's really     
1:16:46     
good also the the the big prevy for that is that um I met somebody there who is     
1:16:53     
working in um basically like virtual reality     
1:17:00     
Technologies and they have you know existing things now but their future plans are very interesting related to     
1:17:08     
some of our our efforts uh and I happened to just the kind of just SC sat     
1:17:13     
together at lunch we're in that big famous like the Hogwarts dinner Hall and Z at the bench I have a picture but I     
1:17:20     
can't find it he's sitting at the like at at the long tables and I just got first you kind of get blocked in but it     
1:17:26     
also like makes you talk to people around you and that guy was was next to me and so I had a really really     
1:17:32     
interesting conversation about like developing and like doing product development in technology but also like     
1:17:38     
where he wants to go with I just sort of make things more     
1:17:45     
open and like how to connect between different like virtual environment environments or virtual environment     
1:17:51     
roals almost like going from different websites or or making like a WordPress uh making a WordPress like     
1:17:59     
like wordpress.com or.org such that you can use this stuff to make a bunch of     
1:18:05     
different websites um and kind of getting getting that to be like at a virtual reality way having it be open um     
1:18:13     
I'm trying to get a way to share my screen here just a second yeah     
1:18:18     
um a window okay I think it's going to be this     
1:18:23     
work um um yeah I'll start quickly by just going     
1:18:29     
about whever yeah just for this uh we actually having a call for volunteers um for for     
1:18:36     
nqu if anybody's interested you can do some of that remote too I know like I think almost everyone here is not in New     
1:18:42     
York state but that's okay if you're so interested or you want to get experience about like if you want to even just get     
1:18:49     
experience about running conferences or or and this is a very you know low budget volunteer nobody's there's it's     
1:18:57     
just the group of volunteers putting on a conference for New Year celebration of M computed um but if you want experience     
1:19:04     
or KN how or like some like project management or like digital uh project management or the     
1:19:11     
things working to that end um you can do that and     
1:19:17     
um we're open for volunteers that way but just just kind of highlighting how     
1:19:23     
many way stories uh have been shared on on LinkedIn and I think we've done such a better job of like trying to document     
1:19:29     
these stories it's been so hard because so much great things happen we don't really document it been able to like     
1:19:35     
collect these people sharing about it and and and tagging this our group on L     
1:19:41     
and that way I can easily reshare these like great stories this is one of our keynote speakers from     
1:19:46     
IBM um this is just another another great story of people just sharing their     
1:19:52     
experiences uh this is this is event this is sort of pictures from the event um I think this is one of our poster     
1:19:58     
winners yeah they went this person won best poster along uh best poster I think     
1:20:04     
is it here but you can just see how Zoom AIT more you can see how like     
1:20:10     
um it was such a nice event and I'm just really proud of everybody who who put it     
1:20:15     
together and stuck with it and and made it happen this year so just big shout out for that um it was very very very     
1:20:21     
successful a lot of really good feedback and uh we um we are doing St starting to plan for     
1:20:28     
next year what you're going to do last last time I probably mentioned nqu for a long time but um thanks to the people     
1:20:35     
who supported that we we at the lab didn't do um we didn't we didn't do any     
1:20:42     
research to present thing academically this time but um     
1:20:48     
we've been involved with nck for several years and I was I was a co-chair this time um officially     
1:20:55     
and it was great to be work with that the team that way and everybody did a     
1:21:01     
really great great job so um yeah that's just just a final sort of Spotlight for     
1:21:08     
that um and any questions about that before I move on to the Oxford uh gaming     
1:21:15     
event um let's see if I can just pull that up     
1:21:20     
um this is sort of the front front page for for um the event and then if I can     
1:21:28     
get the um     
1:21:35     
uh G let     
1:21:43     
see um the print center was amazing I'll just I'll just go here um an overview     
1:21:49     
for for it um was I think I can I'll start with this     
1:21:55     
um this is try to zoom in here um oops this is a little bit too much     
1:22:05     
okay yeah we're starting to get to the the stuff here um so this is some some background for     
1:22:13     
it it held in in Oxford it held at the Oxford internet Institute in the Jesus     
1:22:19     
College which is the name of this like old very old building from like I think     
1:22:24     
the 1500s is when that like part of the college was made     
1:22:29     
um and so yeah um this is me and this is     
1:22:35     
Y2K here on on we're sitting down currently while this other speaker in our panel was talking but as part of     
1:22:42     
plot Twisters we spoke at this panel on um yeah uh well first I'll just since     
1:22:49     
I'm just here we'll talk about this this speaker who was also in our panel was talking about reimagining ch a town     
1:22:55     
spell differently for 2050 and her talk was essentially about using drones to capture existing digital     
1:23:04     
Landscapes but being able to take or existing physical landscapes but but digitizing that and being able to both     
1:23:11     
make personalized digital maps of like existing structures um and but her her main     
1:23:20     
research is about like places and and the stories that places have so she had a really cool discussion     
1:23:26     
about how um you know she's not a technologist in terms     
1:23:32     
of making the the drones or getting the data from them but what she was also doing is thinking how can we use um how     
1:23:41     
can we document or make archives of choices and even potential Pathways for     
1:23:47     
the for the future or like as we're as we're doing things that don't have um you know uh     
1:23:55     
digital you know in an archaological sense you could look at like old blueprints or the tools that were used     
1:24:01     
to make um a city or or a building or institution but now uh a lot of that     
1:24:08     
work is digital so it's like how do you document that process of like creating spaces or creating things creating these     
1:24:15     
like uh future environments that people may be stepping into so Ser a really     
1:24:20     
interesting talk about that um this is a separate thing um separate     
1:24:28     
thing can't find the okay here's the talk I was trying to get at this is this is a nice shot of um of US during our     
1:24:36     
talk uh this is Y2K again here and me sitting down but uh we were talking     
1:24:41     
about twister L which is our our sort of first attempt at a a gaming product but     
1:24:47     
how it's going to be interactive online game mode for fostering diverse personal n building is our lofty goal but the pan     
1:24:54     
that we were on and also that the previous uh speaker I mentioned was on it's called codesign games which is     
1:25:00     
essentially about um     
1:25:06     
uh designing uh with with I don't know how     
1:25:11     
to really say it in a py way but it's about sort of stakeholders but also not just having a more inclusive design     
1:25:19     
practice in general and we talked in our presentation about both um of the     
1:25:24     
challenges that we see in uh in in like     
1:25:30     
education edtech or educational environments that young people may be entering which kind of makes people uh     
1:25:37     
conform to a specific standard perhaps um and sort of the opportunities to okay     
1:25:43     
if that's a challenge we're dealing with how can we create intentionally crafted spaces for people to explore their     
1:25:50     
different ways of having you experience in the world or being uh perhaps diverging or having very specific     
1:25:56     
emotional uh needs or or wanting to just get different environments to deal with     
1:26:01     
their personal narratives and have a St around exploring those things and we talked about both making a game trying     
1:26:08     
to make a game that way and then setting up our organization like how we as a group of people are working to achieve     
1:26:15     
that thing and how we're kind of trying to experiment things uh do it a very different apprach so there was a really     
1:26:21     
cool uh you know a lot to crment 15 minute session we had a few nice questions too and a lot a lot of really     
1:26:28     
good discussions throughout the day um and let me see what else I can find here     
1:26:35     
um yeah um this is the VR person I'll get you in a second     
1:26:42     
um yeah there's a few cool hosts but in the interest of time um the last thing     
1:26:47     
I'll mention is I I'll share this and I'll talk about     
1:26:53     
this I'll go over what I'm saying here um but then I'll try to find the actual     
1:26:58     
agenda and share that after I I'll just go to another tab to get that but U yeah     
1:27:06     
actually if I hold let me let me do something here are you still seeing the     
1:27:11     
linkedin's page yes currently yeah um all right just one second you     
1:27:21     
can like consider okay here we go I got what I looked for okay um I'll go over     
1:27:28     
this agenda um in one second but just to cover this     
1:27:34     
um yeah uh I happen to sit next to Lydia Lydia and in Shane yeah um at at lunch I     
1:27:44     
that's kind of what I was talking about before and just a brief like reflection of all about is sort of how uh at a     
1:27:51     
really interesting point in in being able to develop very intentional spaces to have very specific experiences people     
1:27:58     
would like to have or might need to have either just get away from the to either     
1:28:03     
get away from the stress or to more deeply explore either a stressful thing or something you want to learn about     
1:28:10     
like we have this like unpressed ability to make these spaces um which is really     
1:28:16     
appealing but also there's still the limit of you sort of have one unit of creation that you have to deal with and     
1:28:23     
I feel like there were so many great discussions during the panel or the the whole conference oops um but there     
1:28:31     
wasn't really enough time to to get into all the bigger broader Concepts that play So I have I want to write something     
1:28:38     
about that and I might make a blog post that can be put on the the medium or otherwise but um it was it was a really     
1:28:46     
really fascinating discussion um and I'll just really quickly go through kind     
1:28:51     
of what took place there um um any any immediate questions I can answer before     
1:28:56     
I do that no okay um but yeah uh just super     
1:29:03     
quickly the opening keynot was very cool um and it was very     
1:29:08     
philosophical um and it kind of set the stage for a lot of things that were both     
1:29:14     
uh philosophical and Technical and and sort of almost strategic or uh Market     
1:29:21     
industry based codesign practice for games uh was the panel I was with for     
1:29:27     
plot Twisters down here um oops uh this this person wasn't there     
1:29:34     
which is tough um or I would love to speak to them about that uh this is the     
1:29:40     
one and putam that I mentioned earlier too um I wasn't at this one because it     
1:29:46     
was the same time as ours but this was playing with the past um and actually this we spoke to this     
1:29:52     
person at the uh discussion session this is a very interesting game for um     
1:29:58     
essentially dealing with a very traumatic situation and how do you make a game where you can uh deal with     
1:30:05     
someone in that situation and and take them through it um there's a lot more     
1:30:10     
that could be said about that but uh it's very interesting uh panel session two gaming for purpose exibility gaming     
1:30:18     
I I wish I had I didn't get to attend this one because be to my work but I had some other things to take care of this     
1:30:24     
time slot um I didn't get to do a lot here in this whole session but like this this is a super interesting for me I     
1:30:31     
actually want to talk more to Dr Zan um and one of my one of my friends who I     
1:30:37     
made the conference um uh was very interested in that too uh     
1:30:43     
let's say that alternative modes of gaming and games for young people were both very interesting um it looked at     
1:30:50     
like cozy games versus like really intense walking Simulator games that are dealing with a to honic gameplay just     
1:30:58     
sort of like things that aren't just like sports games or fighting or like crashing cards around and like different     
1:31:05     
types of games um and then safe gaming spaces versus protecting games uh actually uh     
1:31:13     
it's really nice to talk to un a great set of discussions um and we'll have future discussions too she's interested     
1:31:21     
posters and a lot on like uh video game patents uh which is quite interesting     
1:31:28     
this I was at this panel section again um and yeah um that that was that we had     
1:31:36     
a really great lunch session too and and there's things here that we we had um     
1:31:43     
and talk about careers actually there's a lot of good advice on whoops careers too which I won't get into but like if     
1:31:49     
you want to talk about that and talk about these panels just PR out turn you show L of it you can also find this     
1:31:54     
person um on LinkedIn and I think she has a lot of good advice for like what to do um so that's cool and then yeah     
1:32:08     
um okay I didn't get to see soci discuss here but no that's that's a worldwind tour of everything um I know that was     
1:32:15     
just a bunch of like hey this happened this happen this happened but like     
1:32:20     
um it was a really really really really good um both for like FES and for     
1:32:28     
um getting a sense of where very intentionally minded people are both     
1:32:34     
like criticizing where gaming is going building the games um trying to make     
1:32:40     
different kinds of environments for different kinds of opportunity where learning education experiencing play or     
1:32:46     
relaxing Stu and it was just very insightful so I I'll leave it at that     
1:32:52     
for now yeah it looks great great yeah glad you were able to present on that and get some more things out of that I     
1:33:00     
saw that uh thing about the concept to Market pathway that you mentioned was     
1:33:06     
just in the notes and just kind of interesting from a commercialization perspective from a oh there you are with     
1:33:13     
your hat uh my hat and my like travel life faes breaking out and my actually     
1:33:20     
the picture background was uh this is my uh this is I didn't have any pictures     
1:33:25     
time in oxra but the idic fields from when I was there a few years ago oh okay     
1:33:32     
yeah that that's that's when actually Avery was was there too but um     
1:33:38     
yeah but that was I had no time this this whole weeking that no time go on     
1:33:44     
your saying oh yeah this concept to Market pathway so this is something we could cover in our uh open source     
1:33:51     
meetings because it's it's very I think it's important for like you know there     
1:33:56     
this whole issue of like how do you build something that's kind of and not so much for the machine learning stuff     
1:34:02     
but definitely for VR like how do you go from something it's very loose concept to something that you can actually put     
1:34:08     
out and you know maybe open source make an open source product where people     
1:34:13     
download it or people would be willing to pay money for it I mean it's not just a very simple like let's finish the     
1:34:21     
project and make it specific there aspects to it that you need to think about so I don't know a lot I mean I     
1:34:27     
know a little bit about how to do that but it's I don't think anyone really has a a really good idea of how to do that     
1:34:34     
that's why I'm interested in that topic oh yeah and and really I I know I know     
1:34:41     
in know time but really briefly I'll just say like I feel really grateful to kind of had all the different     
1:34:47     
experiences that I've recently had both in terms of trying to make finishing     
1:34:52     
Futures functional to write the papers for that or the projects and and failing some like there's things I didn't do uh     
1:34:59     
make like everything I'm doing with my my day jobs um and and and like how do     
1:35:05     
you make how do you make a health technology product to the games like to     
1:35:11     
ples into what's happening here because like in in artistic spaces I'm using the     
1:35:18     
term like unit of creation which I don't know was a thing but it's my current term for it but you have to make your     
1:35:24     
Choice saying this isn't going to totally be what I want but the limitations are XYZ and it can convey     
1:35:30     
this message or convey this opportunity you can't really you can't really make it's like if when you're writing a story     
1:35:36     
or an essay or something you have to write one essay not all the essays that could be written about the subject when     
1:35:43     
you're writing the paper you have to write the paper that you can write now and not all the papers on the subject     
1:35:49     
and you have to like deal with that limitation and that's something I struggle with obviously like for anybody     
1:35:54     
who's been here knows all about that there's there's you know you have to choose and I feel like this conference     
1:36:01     
has really put that into a new light or like giving me a SP to explore that and then we're talking to that that guy who     
1:36:08     
was also the the closing like keynote um it like we had we had this extended     
1:36:15     
discussion about like the whole actually making it implementing it     
1:36:20     
not just not just implementing the artistic or creative idea but then okay     
1:36:26     
then you have you have to do it in terms of making a VR product and environment or even     
1:36:34     
like a coding product or something that requires software software and or     
1:36:39     
Hardware to do it you have have the limitations but you're doing it there too so that can be a great set of     
1:36:45     
discussions to have uh over the over the summer experience I think     
1:36:51     
so okay yeah that's great well thank you for that update Jesse and I'm glad that your your time in Oxford was well spent     
1:36:58     
and yeah we'll follow up more on this later so looks like hamu and paa had to     
1:37:06     
leave paa said you know thank you for uh she's interested in presenting maybe later she has her document if you have     
1:37:14     
comments put them in there um but thank you for both of you for attending     
1:37:20     
today going to share my screen again     
1:37:25     
and what we usually do is we usually have features I like to go through some papers topical things that uh     
1:37:33     
encountered so uh first thing I'm going to talk about today is there's this paper that was in this uh slack that was     
1:37:40     
shared this is a I'm not going to get deeply into this because quite frankly I'm not that familiar with it but I     
1:37:47     
think it's interesting from the perspective of some of the things we've been talking about so this is u paper on     
1:37:54     
kolov Arnold networks or K and so this is an alternative to uh I guess     
1:38:02     
multi-layer perceptrons and some other models like neural networks so a lot of     
1:38:07     
you who are working on machine learning this is of Interest not necessarily for your immediate projects but just for     
1:38:15     
sort of what people are thinking about uh going forward because there are a lot of limitations to the classical     
1:38:22     
perception on the classical neur Network and so there are other ways you can formulate this and so sometimes you     
1:38:28     
know we think well how can we do this we can look at the brain we can see how     
1:38:33     
that works we can look at physics because uh statistical mechanics you     
1:38:39     
know has a really good model of minimiz energy minimization and things like that so we've talked about things like um uh     
1:38:46     
free energy principle and other things but one Trend that's going on in this area is to start looking at at some of     
1:38:53     
the physics models that have uh existed for years and kind of bring those into the world of information processing     
1:39:01     
explicitly and so you know we have different models like the fusion models are kind of based on sort of a physics     
1:39:09     
statistical mechanics uh there are other models that are based on statistical mechanics there's a lot of physics based     
1:39:16     
neural networks so in this case they're looking at these kog Arnold networks and there are a number of     
1:39:22     
authors on here including Max tegmark who's a a physicist and um so the     
1:39:29     
abstract reads inspired by the kolov Arnold representation theorem which is     
1:39:35     
something that you know I'm not going to get into we propose kolov Arnold networks or cans which are a promising     
1:39:42     
alternative to multi-layer perceptrons or MLPs so a perceptron is you know sort     
1:39:48     
of the basic unit of a neural network where you know you have bunch of inputs     
1:39:54     
to a single uh perceptron that classifies the inputs in an ordered way     
1:40:00     
and so you know this is something that is you know has weights so the inputs are weighted appropriately and you get     
1:40:07     
your classification uh so they compare cans to multi-layer perceptrons well MLPs     
1:40:15     
have fixed activation functions on nodes or neurons so the neurons are the nodes     
1:40:20     
the activation function is a way to sort of activate different inputs to the     
1:40:26     
neuron uh and it's based on weights but it's based on rules like railu and other     
1:40:31     
things um cans by contrast have learnable activation functions on edges     
1:40:37     
or weights so um you know we have our weights we have our no we have our edges     
1:40:42     
we have our nodes the edges of the weights the nodes have are these processing units and then we have our     
1:40:49     
activation functions so let me see if I can draw this out on the board a multi- perceptron you know you kind of think     
1:40:56     
about this as having your different inputs and they come into this     
1:41:01     
neuron which is here and then we have an output from     
1:41:07     
that neuron so we take the inputs and what we want to know is like given a     
1:41:13     
certain amount of each input what is you know can we classify     
1:41:18     
the output and so each of these have a weight which is usually some decimal     
1:41:24     
value you know and then we have an activation function which is where you     
1:41:31     
have I don't know there could it could be a logical function it could be like a specific type like a sigmoidal function     
1:41:38     
it could be a lot of different ways to to activate the neuron so it's based on     
1:41:43     
you know inputs to a neuron in biophysics but we're doing this computation so that's how we have our     
1:41:50     
percepture on our MLP and so we have basically nodes here     
1:41:57     
weights are here and our activation function is here all right so that's basically how     
1:42:05     
this works in the activation function we could use like a step     
1:42:13     
function or a sigmoidal function basically something that triggers the     
1:42:19     
activation of this neuron to put it in give give an output that is in a certain class so it's either on or off in in     
1:42:27     
biophysics parin it could be in different categories as well so they're saying here in this     
1:42:34     
paper is that our multi-layer perceptrons are fixed activation functions on nodes so we use the     
1:42:42     
node as a way to sort these inputs we have a single activation function that     
1:42:47     
we use and we make these categorizations in cans we have     
1:42:53     
learnable activation functions which means that these activation functions are you know tuned to the data so we     
1:43:00     
don't have like a single like we can't just say everything is subject to a step function or everything is subject to a     
1:43:07     
sigmoidal function we actually learn the function and so they might look weird to us so we you know we have our step     
1:43:13     
function we have our sigmoidal and we know these we have other methods to to look     
1:43:21     
at different functions what they're saying is that you're learning it so it could be a weird kind of activation     
1:43:27     
function that could be like multimodal or something else so that's     
1:43:32     
what they're getting at here and the idea is you're learning from the data you're not imposing an activation     
1:43:37     
function but it's also this aspect of learning or or it's a learnable     
1:43:43     
activation function on edges so the weights are actually important here what are the weights and it's taking the     
1:43:49     
information about the weights and it's using that to learn the activation function so cans actually have no linear weights     
1:43:56     
at all okay so in our model of the uh     
1:44:01     
perceptron these are linear linear weights right you can combine them linearly you can uh treat them as linear     
1:44:09     
linearly separable um cans have no linear weights at all every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate     
1:44:15     
function parameterized as a spline so a spline of course fits the data if you     
1:44:21     
have a b variate representation uh you know you have so if you have a barari representation of data     
1:44:29     
points and they exist in this by varod space you know you can fit it with a     
1:44:35     
linear function like this and kind of predict from there but you have a lot of variance perhaps so in     
1:44:43     
cases of high variance it's not really useful to have a linear function like this and this would be like a typical     
1:44:48     
activation function where you're fitting your data to a linear function uh spline     
1:44:54     
on the other hand is where you find the best fit which you kind of move through your data points like this so you find     
1:45:00     
the nearest neighbor basically to that function and then this informs your your     
1:45:06     
activation function so it can be very different than a normal activation     
1:45:11     
function in a percep so we show that the seemingly     
1:45:17     
simple change makes cans outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interoperability so for for example we     
1:45:23     
know kind of what a can is doing more than an MLP because it's learning there     
1:45:28     
a function we look at the function we say okay it's basically learning the distribution of the input data uh     
1:45:35     
whereas MLPs are just kind of imposing this linear uh regime normalizing the     
1:45:41     
points but we don't know kind of what the you know it's hard to interpret the     
1:45:46     
out uh but it's also more accurate because you have a better approximation of the points for accuracy much smaller     
1:45:53     
cans can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs and data     
1:45:58     
fitting and PD solving par partial differential equation solving so you     
1:46:03     
know uh differential equation solving is a nice problem Benchmark problem uh but     
1:46:09     
also data fitting uh and and we can do both of those with cans over     
1:46:15     
MLPs theoretically and empirically cans possess faster neural scaling laws than     
1:46:20     
MLPs which is this idea from uh neural networks where you have this the larger     
1:46:26     
the model the more sort of competent the model is or the the better the     
1:46:31     
performance and so yeah they they talk about that in the paper for inoperability cans can be intuitively     
1:46:39     
visualized and can easily interact with human users and so you can visualize     
1:46:44     
these intuitively through two exper examples in mathematics and physics cans     
1:46:49     
are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists ReDiscover mathematical and physical laws so they     
1:46:55     
use cans to discover mathematical and physical laws which are these regularities and the data that we often     
1:47:03     
you know like to think about in physics you know we like to think about linear scalings and you know patterns and so we     
1:47:11     
can do these things with a can and we can do these things with a perceptron but not as well in summary cans are     
1:47:18     
promising alternatives for MLPs opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning and models which     
1:47:25     
rely heavily on MLPs so the lesson here is that cans are better than     
1:47:32     
mops so we have     
1:47:38     
hands PS and we can do different things we have discover we have uh     
1:47:50     
discoverability inability     
1:48:03     
and then um you know it you know the scaling so we have the scaling aspect as     
1:48:11     
well so yeah so okay so let's see if we have     
1:48:17     
this is a sort of a graphical abstract here so we have multi-layer perceptrons on the left and kolov Arnold networks on     
1:48:24     
the right and we this table kind of summarizes things in terms of different     
1:48:29     
aspects of the models so we have the models the theorems multi-layer perceptrons use the universal     
1:48:36     
approximation theorem the mov Arnold networks use the Comm Arnold representation theorem so this is again     
1:48:43     
uh in multi-layer perceptrons you have this Universal approximation whereas in kov ernold you have this more specific     
1:48:51     
type of representation and so the formula is thus in     
1:48:56     
multi-layer perceptrons you're summing the inputs you're doing this linearly and you're getting this function in     
1:49:02     
kogar arnal or it's it's equivalent to an activation function uh in kogar Arnold     
1:49:08     
representation Theory you have this function that's equal equivalent or equal to these uh these summations of     
1:49:16     
the data and so this is basically it's a different type of formalization um you have these two     
1:49:23     
different models so in the multi-layer perceptrons like I said you have a bunch     
1:49:28     
of um you have fixed activation functions on nodes you have learnable     
1:49:34     
weights on edges uh you have these uh in in kobra Arnold networks you have     
1:49:40     
learnable activation functions on edges and some operations on nodes so you have     
1:49:46     
these activation functions with a middle layer of nodes and a top layer of nodes and a bottom layer of nodes so it's a     
1:49:52     
little bit different structure of the network and then you for the formula     
1:49:57     
here for MLP you have these this formula here for cans you have this formula here     
1:50:03     
you're basically U substituting I think the variance for this other term and I I     
1:50:10     
don't know the details I'm not going to get into the details but it's it's a different way of of thinking about it     
1:50:16     
and then for your deep model you have so this is the shallow approximation here where we have like a two- layered system     
1:50:23     
for the Deep system here we have uh you know these different layers and we're     
1:50:29     
doing this sort of thing on we're kind of uh we have the fixed activation functions on nodes from multiple layers     
1:50:36     
we have these lineable weights on edges from multiple layers uh and in cans we have this the     
1:50:43     
same model as we have in the shallow case but we're kind of uh learning you     
1:50:48     
know so it's nonlinear and learnable versus being nonlinear in fixed and linear learnable for multi-war     
1:50:56     
perceptrons so the nonlinear aspect is learnable in cans the linear aspect is     
1:51:01     
learnable in MLPs but in you know in cans that's you know that's less relevant than the non linear so it's     
1:51:08     
very good for like you know problems that are nonlinear and so um basically things     
1:51:14     
that aren't very simple problems okay so um that's that's a new     
1:51:19     
newer approach new work paper and it's very quick overview but I just wanted to get through that and make people aware     
1:51:26     
of that paper Okay um any questions comments no     
1:51:32     
no I'm I'd be really interested to to cover that more um it it's really lit up     
1:51:40     
all the machine learning blogs um and     
1:51:45     
yeah it's got a great P pedigree and um and I I think it's uh     
1:51:53     
the useless blindes you know going back to Grace Waba um have have     
1:52:00     
been yeah it's a it's a somewhat overlooked topic but when when applied     
1:52:06     
well have have always been incredibly powerful so I think it's just     
1:52:11     
interesting to introduce them into the into the architecture like this and and     
1:52:16     
yeah see see what can happen yeah and the key here is uh     
1:52:22     
Implement well because splines are notorious for overfitting like you can have a spline that overfits the data as     
1:52:30     
well so it can be a problem yeah yeah I mean totally totally uh you know again     
1:52:37     
uh it's one of those yeah it's it's one of those topics     
1:52:43     
though where if if you can find that um     
1:52:48     
that middle way with them yeah uh um that's that's you know again the the     
1:52:57     
power uh what what she showed was just     
1:53:02     
how yeah how how they made I mean this is like 80s 90s but you know was making     
1:53:09     
particular problems in in climate modeling um tracking right right and and     
1:53:16     
at least you know again like I I haven't played with this all uh but but um um     
1:53:23     
it it seems like what they're kind of touting it as is like like when when     
1:53:28     
done right this is this is providing an incredibly efficient um     
1:53:35     
representation that can you know with a smaller kind of footprint is is     
1:53:41     
explaining much larger MLP models is is handling the     
1:53:47     
same as larger MP models so yeah again I think think it looks really     
1:53:53     
interesting yeah so yeah the other thing then is this tractability issue or like     
1:54:00     
I guess uh nonlinear tractability I will add that to our list     
1:54:06     
of things that it does over L and so this this is important for finding Like     
1:54:12     
rules laws in nature because we have a lot of laws     
1:54:18     
that are kind of you know we have things that are very simple linear relationships like we'll have like a by     
1:54:26     
variant relationship that we can say it's a law and you know we have we might     
1:54:31     
test on a very simple data set and then we might go to a very large or complex data set and it might not hold on the     
1:54:38     
other hand there are a lot of laws that we don't know because the laws is too nonlinear for us to sort of visualize     
1:54:45     
easily and extract out of a data set so if it's like some like we can take     
1:54:50     
psychophysical laws as an example there are a lot of psychophysical relationships that are like if I show     
1:54:57     
you an intensity of light you know your response time might be conditioned by     
1:55:02     
the intensity of light so the higher the intensity of light the faster you respond the lower the intensity of light     
1:55:09     
I'll respond slower to say the change in the intensity of light uh so if if the     
1:55:14     
light changes very quickly if there's a bright flash I'll hit a button if it's     
1:55:19     
like a very slow change in intensity I'll okay there it changes and I'll CH     
1:55:26     
hit the button so that can be characterized as like something that's a linear function or like a log function     
1:55:33     
which is slightly nonlinear but what they're saying is that you know you can have data where people not only do this     
1:55:39     
but they do it at different scales they do it in different ways that have a lot of nonlinearity have a lot of these sort     
1:55:46     
of where you might put a spline like a third or fourth order um uh spline and     
1:55:53     
you know you'll get this uh complex pattern of responses that don't match that kind of simple line or simple     
1:56:00     
function so the function is much more complex maybe there're different populations that behave differently     
1:56:07     
maybe intensities of light it doesn't saturate there's actually some other aspect of the performance and so this is     
1:56:14     
good when you're dealing with a lot of data where you have a lot of potential patterns a lot more than if you had just     
1:56:20     
a uh maybe a a thousand data points if you had a billion data points you're     
1:56:25     
going to have a lot more opportunity to observe a lot more modes of behavior but     
1:56:30     
also you know when you have these kind of systems where they're just too not the response is just too nonlinear to     
1:56:37     
get with a simple by variant relationship and you need you know maybe higher dimensional things that can kind     
1:56:44     
of be summarized in two Dimensions um so yeah definitely     
1:56:49     
interesting and this is like you know if in machine learning people have run up against a lot of these problems and     
1:56:55     
they've been trying to figure out how to get at them so this is one such a     
1:57:03     
time that's great U so the other thing I want to talk about today is this interesting set of uh papers and     
1:57:10     
exercise this was I think I I don't know if I posted this or someone else posted this but this was uh a paper on     
1:57:19     
multiomic and a response to exercise so basically What's Happening Here is     
1:57:24     
they're using a mouse model uh to look at the response to endurance exercise     
1:57:29     
training so you can put a mouse on a wheel and you can train it to run on that wheel for a long you know long     
1:57:36     
periods of time and then look at the response of the muscle of the physiology     
1:57:41     
of the mouse so this article is called temporal dynamics of the multiomic     
1:57:47     
response to endurance exercise training and what that means is that you have you're interested in the time in the     
1:57:54     
time series that are generated by the response to exercise so if I put a mouse     
1:57:59     
on wheel for say like two weeks in different training BS there's going to     
1:58:04     
be a response within the mouse the physiology of the mouse and it's going to have a lot of different scales of of     
1:58:10     
of response so you have these very shortterm responses which are these     
1:58:16     
early immediate early genes that that are expressed you have other types of genes that are expressed with respect to     
1:58:23     
stress with respect to uh metabolism and so forth then you have these longer term     
1:58:29     
responses which are adap adaptations uh you know uh sort of the     
1:58:35     
benefits or improvements of training and so forth so this is where you know we need to kind of tease these things out     
1:58:41     
we can actually from the temporal Dynamics we can also tease out the relationship perhaps between what's     
1:58:48     
going on at the molecular scale and what's going on at the phys phenotypic scale and so we talked about a data set     
1:58:56     
a couple weeks ago on um my on mice and early immedia genes it was an atlas of     
1:59:03     
uh you know data and so this is I don't think this is related to that but there is this uh so this is put out by uh the     
1:59:12     
motor pack study group so this is mot R Pac it's very tortured acronym but this     
1:59:19     
is the group that's that's behind this I don't think it's the same group I think it's a different group um but anyways     
1:59:26     
they're looking at this problem uh they're looking at this response to endurance     
1:59:31     
exercise so if we read the abstract uh they say regular exercise     
1:59:36     
promotes whole body health and prevents disease but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood     
1:59:43     
so we don't know uh well we know you know we maybe don't know the molecular     
1:59:48     
mechanisms we have data on the molecular aspects of this but aside from those mechanisms we're     
1:59:54     
trying to link what's going on at the molecular scale to the phope so if we have gene expression we want to know     
2:00:02     
what that causes in the phenotype or does that cause other parts of the molecular billu to to     
2:00:09     
change so what they're interested in is uh the molecu oh the mo motor pack     
2:00:15     
stands for molecular transducers of physical activity consortion and so you can take up     
2:00:22     
letters as you will and figure out what that how that translates but basically they want to profile the temporal     
2:00:29     
transcriptome so the things that are transcribed in the genome over time they     
2:00:35     
also want to look at the proteome or the production of proteins over time a metabolome or changes in metabolism over     
2:00:42     
time the lipidome or changes in uh fat composition over time and different     
2:00:48     
types of lipids being produced the phosph uh phosphor proteome which is the     
2:00:55     
uh production of phosphorilation events so proteins and uh you know a lot of     
2:01:01     
things at the molecular level are dependent on phosphorilation so there's a lot of this these phosphorilation     
2:01:07     
activities that are involved in regulation and there's this you know there like multiple phosphorilation     
2:01:14     
events that can occur that have to occur to regulate different molecules products     
2:01:19     
so you know there's this language of of phosphorilation so you can look at     
2:01:26     
phosphorilation as an M uh AAL proteome ubiquit proteome epig genome     
2:01:33     
and immunome so basically they're looking at a lot of these different uh sort of spheres of influence different     
2:01:40     
aspects of the molecular billu from producing different types of biochemicals to producing proteins to     
2:01:48     
the response of genes to the response of the EP genome and so forth so they're     
2:01:54     
looking at all these different things and they're trying to put them together and as you can imagine it's quite complex quite complex data set and it's     
2:02:01     
going to be very hard probably to get some insight out of this but let's see what they do so they take whole blood     
2:02:08     
and plasma which are the samples that they use from so the the brat runs on the wheel they sample the blood and     
2:02:13     
plasma they get the molecular information from that things are uppr     
2:02:18     
regulated things are down regulated they get a you know you see evidence of that in the blond plasm so and solid tissu so     
2:02:26     
they actually can get solid tissues out of the specimens as     
2:02:32     
well uh the sample size is I think 18 or 19 uh at four training points but you     
2:02:39     
know this is enough to do uh some pretty good analysis so they're looking at male     
2:02:46     
and female ratus nerv uh nervus which is a model rat or a model organism of rat     
2:02:53     
if they're you know this is typical you use some sort of mine model which is a rat or a mouse you put them on a wheel     
2:03:00     
it's a very simple model to assay you know it's it's it's supposed to be an analogy to humans we've talked about     
2:03:07     
this in the past of course there differences between you know mice and rats and humans but you know it's I     
2:03:13     
think it's good enough to get a a sense of these kind of changes so they do     
2:03:19     
eight weeks of endurance exercise training and they take four time points within that 8 weeks so they're looking     
2:03:25     
at like two we intervals so over two weeks you can have a lot of changes but you know over over eight weeks we can     
2:03:31     
have a lot more changes so um Okay thousands of shared and tissue     
2:03:38     
specific molecular alterations were identified with sex differences found in multiple tissues so we're looking not     
2:03:44     
only at some of these changes in the molecular milu all these different parts of you know mo these measures of     
2:03:52     
molecular change but also sex differences so between males and females     
2:03:58     
and we find this in multiple tissues so if we sample say like muscle versus heart muscle versus brain versus um you     
2:04:06     
know epithelium we we get all these different responses and we get sex differences as     
2:04:13     
well temporal multiomic and multi tissue analysis revealed expansive biological     
2:04:19     
insights into the Adaptive responses to endurance training including widespread     
2:04:24     
regulation of immune metabolic stress response and mitochondrial Pathways so     
2:04:30     
these are you know we we would probably guess this from uh just kind of thinking     
2:04:36     
if you know what about physiology you think okay these are the places where we'd expect to find uh changes and     
2:04:43     
there's a lot of Regulation there so I mean it's not just as simple as saying that you have to look at the data and of     
2:04:48     
course it's much more complex than than just saying that but but if we look at the immune system for example of course     
2:04:54     
we're going to have an immune response to exercise exercise is what they call     
2:05:01     
challenge to the physiology so you know exercise it's almost like a stress if     
2:05:07     
you do a lot of exercise you're changing basically your sort of uh you know     
2:05:14     
equilibrium point or your homeostatic point and so there going to be a lot of changes in different systems and may or     
2:05:20     
may not correspond on so you would expect the immune system to change because the immune system is like that     
2:05:27     
if there's a challenge it it you know tries to adapt and learn from that the     
2:05:32     
metabolic system which is uh of course met metabolism which means that you have     
2:05:38     
changes of metabolism corresponding to needs uh in in the exercise uh regimen     
2:05:45     
you know if you need to say build more muscle then you build more muscle if muscle needs to break down it breaks     
2:05:51     
down fat breaks down things you know things happen uh then the stress     
2:05:56     
response of mitochondrial Pathways mitochondria of course is involved in energetics in producing energy and then     
2:06:03     
the stress response is of course because this is a stress you know exercise stress on the bone stress on the muscle     
2:06:11     
there's catabolism of muscle as well as metabolism there's also stress on bone     
2:06:16     
and so bone needs to be remodeled so that's where we're getting all these changes     
2:06:21     
now they said that many changes were relevant to human health including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease     
2:06:28     
inflammatory bottle disease card cardiovascular health and tissue injury and recovery so all these things are     
2:06:35     
implied from sort of the data that they collected the the analysis that they give actually implies that these these     
2:06:41     
sorts of you know if you they uh exercise regimen does things to the     
2:06:48     
physiology sometimes it's a lot of times it's good but sometimes it can be dilit terious and it just depends on you know     
2:06:55     
the way that you approach the exercise Vision but there are also changes that are relevant to human health so you know     
2:07:03     
activating certain Pathways either through exercise or through some artificial means can affect these     
2:07:08     
different conditions in humans just because they're you know Shar you know they they're they find that some genes     
2:07:15     
are involv say in some disease or disorder and they are genes that get changed positively with exercise so     
2:07:21     
they're making that connection and so you're making actually two assumptions here one is that what you're studying in     
2:07:28     
in the miroring models is relevant to what we have in humans uh that you know     
2:07:34     
that they're they many shared Pathways but also that um that these these shared     
2:07:40     
regulatory mechanisms these shared Mo you know changes in molecular expression     
2:07:46     
are going to have an effect so if we do some intervention exercise and improves     
2:07:53     
condition X because they share a molecular underpinning so that that's that's what     
2:07:59     
they're getting in here the data and analyses presented in the study will serve as valuable resources for     
2:08:05     
understanding and exploring the multitissue molecular effects of endurance training and are provided in a     
2:08:11     
public repository which is this motor Pac dd. org site so this is their uh     
2:08:18     
data Hub so this is their Consortium and uh this is it its goal is to study     
2:08:26     
the molecular changes that occur in response to exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how     
2:08:31     
physical activity improves and preserves health and they want to generate a molecular map of the effects of exercise     
2:08:38     
so this is where we have you can explore the data their different     
2:08:43     
Publications uh yeah this is actually some of the graph characteristics so this is over so they     
2:08:50     
sample an eight week interval week one week two week four and week eight they     
2:08:56     
have what they call anoid which are the sort of the uh you know what they have     
2:09:02     
in terms of the effect size uh and then they have everything for coded and you     
2:09:09     
can explore the visualization so this is the exploration of this visualization you can simulate     
2:09:16     
this by changing the parameters you can get um you know you can EXP of the data     
2:09:22     
set by sort of stratified by uh gender and by um change in different tissues     
2:09:31     
and then also by this time these time LS so you get these nice trajectories over     
2:09:36     
time um actually I'm not sure this could be that same group let's see what their Publications look like oh it's not the     
2:09:44     
same group this is a national group but they're um yeah I don't know what this     
2:09:50     
it could be some of the people from the other group too but I'm not sure in any case um they've published a lot of     
2:09:57     
things in this area so this is a it's a nice resource     
2:10:03     
for looking at the effects of exercise the effects of adapt uh adaptation and     
2:10:08     
things like that so this is kind of a final shot of what they're doing here     
2:10:14     
this is the rat it's kind of laid out in this way and you have these different tissues that they sampled so they     
2:10:20     
sampled from the the brain from the heart uh from lung uh liver     
2:10:27     
spleen uh kidney adrenal gland ovary and then the intestines testes and um if     
2:10:36     
they sampled from the yeah from the skin so there are a lot of different tissues     
2:10:41     
that they sampled they did these training regimens over time they changed     
2:10:46     
the incline so this is the rat on a platform here I guess they're on a     
2:10:52     
treadmill you can see it here and the treadmill sort of inclines with and     
2:10:58     
that's sort of index a difficulty over time so as it you know kind of gets used to being at like a 10 degree angle they     
2:11:06     
tilt it to a 45 degree angle and it makes it increasingly harder for the rat to do its exercise but it's you know     
2:11:13     
it's it's getting more used to doing exercise so this uh effect is increasing     
2:11:18     
this incline times duration time speed increasing with increased training and     
2:11:24     
that's having an effect on the tissues in the in the rat so we have you know     
2:11:30     
these weeks of training you start with sedentary rats male and female and you     
2:11:36     
go to week eight and then they of course harvest the organs they get blood and plasma and they analyze all of that they     
2:11:43     
do the chemical analysis and then you end up with a graph like this where you have uh the different uh measures the     
2:11:51     
different types of systems that we want to look at and then the different tissues and different sources of of     
2:11:58     
molecular information and then we have our differential proportion of analyes     
2:12:04     
across these different uh types of me systems and so this these are we have     
2:12:10     
genomics proteomics metabolomics and amino acid so that's the color coding     
2:12:16     
here and then yeah so that that's the kind of data you end up with the sort of major     
2:12:23     
so uh that's all I just wanted to go over that paper because I thought it was a very cool paper and we've talked about     
2:12:29     
this in the past um and so okay so Jesse get put a link     
2:12:35     
uh a link to the LinkedIn post on the K or the kamalov Arnold Network's paper     
2:12:43     
it's it's yeah it's been blowing up on social medias they say um and then so     
2:12:49     
actually mahul had a question about that paper paper very interesting paper I wonder where it's submitted it mentions     
2:12:55     
under review it could be to one of the machine learning conferences um I don't I didn't     
2:13:01     
understand how it's inable so Morgan did you have any thoughts on that on how K are inter more     
2:13:08     
interoperable than     
2:13:15     
perceptrons I'm not sure if I've got that yet uh um you     
2:13:22     
know I think there's just think they're making the claim that these that that a     
2:13:28     
smaller model will will lend itself towards that yeah you know that that     
2:13:34     
that um you know that it will be easier to     
2:13:41     
identify um the the I mean I think     
2:13:46     
that's isn't that kind of the criticism with deep learning is that you     
2:13:52     
know that you you know on one hand it handles kind of feature engineering for     
2:13:57     
you on the other hand you know because you don't really understand how that was formed you it becomes less     
2:14:06     
interpretable um and so you do all this kind of post Haw work to to examine the     
2:14:12     
the weights and things like like you know I mean you can somewhat think about it as like a smaller model gives you a a     
2:14:21     
[Music] just in the the general lineer model     
2:14:27     
kind of framework you know a smaller a smaller model gives you a More     
2:14:33     
interpretable Design Matrix that that lends itself to the you know which     
2:14:39     
factors were important again I'm I'm dropping down into the linear     
2:14:45     
model but but I I I don't know if that helps right I or if that seems right but     
2:14:52     
um but I really haven't looked at it like I just I just saw every single kind     
2:14:58     
of ml group blog or you know blog uh     
2:15:04     
cover this paper and you know say stuff about it and uh so so really interesting to look     
2:15:12     
at especially from the uh oh yeah yeah sure I mean like yeah let's let's not     
2:15:19     
let's not just um pass this you know I think it's going to be I think it's interesting to follow up on     
2:15:25     
this especially the um uh because it does kind of relate to     
2:15:31     
this um you know scientific law Discovery oh     
2:15:36     
yeah mode of of of um uh I don't want to     
2:15:42     
just say deep learning but just machine learning in in general and and somewhat     
2:15:49     
towards again like like cover the um um the Steve Brunton     
2:15:55     
overview of of all his topics in terms of of you know and again remembering     
2:16:02     
that he's the co-director of the Dynamics AI you know NSF Center like     
2:16:08     
like and that's that's it right it's it's like you know can we can we in an     
2:16:16     
unsupervised way find the governing equations yeah yeah sort of     
2:16:24     
right um uh yeah so it it does look     
2:16:30     
interesting and um and again I I I you know when I I hadn't again i' had seen     
2:16:37     
it like past past like you know all I thought in my own head was just like why     
2:16:43     
don't I know the cmer Arnold's representation here I don't think a lot     
2:16:48     
of people do that's kind of the point I I you know I was like like it's I take     
2:16:54     
it it's not information Theory right like you know but but I I don't I you     
2:17:00     
know I don't know you know I certainly think of Arnold as being uh well I mean that you know     
2:17:08     
Russian Russian mass at that time definitely gonna be like pde really like you know and     
2:17:16     
U so and there's kamalov information Theory which is yeah right right right     
2:17:23     
right you know which yeah um so     
2:17:29     
uh yeah let's let's see if we can find some you know I I haven't played with it     
2:17:34     
enough to see whether there's some good toy models to to work with and and um     
2:17:41     
and yeah like in their in their examples for instance yeah the benchmarking is     
2:17:48     
always the key yeah but well yeah but does does their do their     
2:17:55     
particular examples give us nice um intuitions as to how these this this is     
2:18:03     
going to behave differently or you know more interpretably so I had a point on this     
2:18:10     
yeah so what it's doing is it's learning the activation function so if you just say put out like a sigmoidal and     
2:18:17     
something and say this is behaves according to a sigmoidal well there might be different reasons why it it     
2:18:22     
performs all the sigmoidal so you don't know like exactly what the data on how     
2:18:28     
the data map to that activation function there could be a lot of ways and so you can't interpret that if you're learning     
2:18:35     
an activation function then you have a unique activation function for any one set of data and so you can say like okay     
2:18:42     
there's this multimodality because it's you know very there's this pattern in the data it makes it a little bit more     
2:18:48     
interpretable but I don't know if like maybe that's not always the case like it could be less interpretable depending on     
2:18:55     
what your definition of interpretability is yeah yeah again this isn't this isn't     
2:19:00     
how my mind works or you know like like I need to see it at a inory problem     
2:19:05     
right or you know with with you know I need to feed it some particular inputs     
2:19:11     
that will help help my intuition yeah yeah uh uh but but it would be really     
2:19:17     
interesting and um and yeah and just about the the exerc well the multiomic U     
2:19:26     
and exercise again super super interesting what they're doing as an example just as     
2:19:34     
a great example of kind of modern physiology research oh yeah you know I     
2:19:40     
mean that's that's like again you know taking taking examples of     
2:19:47     
groups doing it right even for for you know in this case exercise um but then     
2:19:55     
thinking about how you know how how we're not doing     
2:20:01     
that for Psychiatry right and like and this is just exercise right right right this is just     
2:20:07     
like like they're running in a you know I mean like you know just yeah yeah I     
2:20:13     
mean this is this is you we we all have this machine at the gym yeah uh um but just how much more     
2:20:22     
complicated the physiology that we're talking about is for you know for     
2:20:27     
cognition memory uh um you know all the various you know aspects that that are     
2:20:35     
um potentially influence in in mental health issues yeah     
2:20:42     
so it's it's it's great to great to see and great to learn     
2:20:47     
from yeah all right well than thanks uh yeah and so we yeah everyone else had to     
2:20:54     
go so we uh it's fine thank you for attending and uh all right so yeah thanks for attending we had a good     
2:21:00     
meeting and let's keep up the conversation and the slack and we'll probably do another just talk related     
2:21:06     
event next week take care

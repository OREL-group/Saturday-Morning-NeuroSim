## NOTES
Sarrah ‚Äî resources (on ABMs-LLMs).

Jesse ‚Äî open-source infrastructure.

Jen ‚Äî onboarding materials.


Resources on Notion (for DevoWorm and OREL).

* 5-minute video from the open house collection (start guide).

Open House 2022. GSoC contributors ‚Äî GSoC open-source scholar. Open-source development scholar. GSoC development team.

* scholars program ‚Äî NYCWiC ‚Äî startup experience (Jen‚Äôs help). Jen Jiang (project management, Psychiatry).

Inclusive gaming ‚Äî how to start a career in AAA+?

* intentional discussions ‚Äî Deploy or Die?


How to document conference (connection you can draw upon later). Different strands, different people.

* outcome Paola is looking for. Labels are metadata, card would generate data itself (Markup ‚Äî XML). 

* passed by language model. Moving towards LLM queries ‚Äî facilitate NeuroGPT.

* don‚Äôt separate model from text programming. Model cards ‚Äî to model write-up. Literate programming style.


LaTex ‚Äî> generates raw HTML, link to model cards as XML. Easiest way to generate this automatically.

* sociotechnical not just a technical analysis.


Military recognized this in software engineering best practices.

* GSoC documentation. Reading Neuro paper does not give access to model and data.

* computer has access too full stack. Automated lab driving.


Neuroscience data is a mess. How well can human brains learn from a very small number of samples (Organoid Intelligence) vs. how many games of Go do you need to search to beat humans.

Big Brain Dataset (estimates of brain samples). Multiple datasets need to be linked.

Meeting in 2017-18: NeuralStorm (https://neuroengineering.ucdavis.edu/nsf-training-program-neuralstorm).

Blue Brain project ‚Äî software contributions. Active Learning ‚Äî tries to get at organoid intelligence.


Python script for analysis, model cards.

* pie charts with percentages ‚Äî subcluster ID and content. Hierarchical Clustering.

* click on supercluster to ID (from business intelligence). Power BI software. Data tree, mind map (visualization).

* superclusters have a name and integer value.


Model Cards ‚Äî set of slots, denote values used by AI.


Read, tells you what is in the model.

* Huggingface ‚Äî> model cards collections (Example: https://huggingface.co/lisali126/hf-hub-modelcards-pr-test). 

* don‚Äôt need to write things out in XML.


Structure has to be reflected in the model card.

* Lennarsson lab, clustering (UMAP). Nonlinear projection.


Improve via in silico techniques. SynBioBeta ‚Äî pipelines are not incredibly productive.

For later: I found an old draft on "beyond demo/deploy or die"  - about a culture of open communication

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
Google Summer of Code is a fairly structured program which had its project selection much earlier this year. So it wont' be a part of "this years" GSoC per se, but, it could be an open source project that the lab looks to develop outside of GSoC

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
That said, I think it woudl be great to see basically a "call for involvement" or a project proposal written up (or a video going through things sort of like here) , and that way it could be mentioned or help recruited for it when available. 
Jes (OREL) says:
Morgan I'd be curious to see what (oxford?) models and latex you're referencing

Paola Di Maio says:
yes, if you can access the paper please share it I could only access the preprint 
Paola Di Maio says:

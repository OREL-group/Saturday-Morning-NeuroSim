hello hello how are you I'm okay good     
0:05     
sort of that mid to late [Music]     
0:10     
July appreciation of Summer yeah feeling     
0:16     
like it's in academic terms or like in the cycles of thing terms like oh my God     
0:23     
it's it's going to be over real soon yeah     
0:31     
it's good so what are you doing these days what's     
0:37     
your I'm sorry what are you doing uh what have you been doing this     
0:42     
week um also is it is the noise here okay there's sort of a noise in the     
0:49     
background that's fine it's fine [Music]     
0:55     
um this week was a very interesting week for me     
1:00     
um not a lot of like Orel things have like     
1:06     
happened um in a direct sense like uh the meetings that I usually have still     
1:13     
didn't happen yet as we know um one of them was sort     
1:19     
of taken over by a neurom mentoring session which is very interesting and     
1:25     
unexpected um and a little bit disorganized but     
1:30     
it worked out it worked out pretty well and it made it interesting context from     
1:37     
that um doing a lot of     
1:43     
um this is sort of an overview this is this the updates but just like a super broad overview of things     
1:51     
um really happy with Joe Pro stuff because it's     
1:58     
finally it's finally [Music] um     
2:05     
like even in the initial sense of it's it's it's just that the kind of work     
2:12     
that even like I'm I'm I'm doing some through the website um and it won't like to     
2:20     
everybody else it won't it will be like oh well this looks nothing's changing here but sometimes it's about     
2:28     
building sort of like the infrastructure so that way things can happen later yeah     
2:35     
that you want to do and I feel like the corner is being turned there a little     
2:40     
bit um and that's a relief     
2:47     
um I the biggest thing this week that I didn't like my biggest disappointment     
2:52     
this week is I really didn't get to sit down and     
2:58     
um do any writing this week this week is a complete writing no movement week and     
3:04     
there's I'm trying to be pretty ambitious in the things that I'm trying to write or finish writing um and I I've gotten most things     
3:12     
to sort of like final draft or final second to     
3:18     
final draft um like like     
3:24     
like the inclusive gaming conference post is ever on my mind and that's ready     
3:30     
to go I'm just actually a lot of it a lot of has been um not even that part of     
3:37     
the writing but was sort of the I had to update Jo Pro stuff I had to update my own website I had to update like like     
3:44     
all the like the the web the the really unpleasant web infrastructure that is so     
3:51     
much more convenient to Outsource than you want to do it with the RS you can um that's that's what it's been a     
3:58     
lot of and this week is a little bit slower in general for variety     
4:03     
reasons um but like progress has been made there     
4:08     
and it's it feels good to do that even if it's like I don't have anything fun     
4:15     
obviously to show but um that's been that's basically the vibe that's the     
4:23     
vibe uh of this week speaking from Saturday yeah     
4:31     
um there's more to say about the neuromat session there's more to say about     
4:40     
um I didn't do anything with them but I I asked if Morgan shows up I asked Morgan about something about neurotech X     
4:49     
um nothing I'm mostly just curious about     
4:54     
some some of the Boston stuff I'm going try to do a few things there or ask about it     
5:03     
um these it's been really interesting to to continue to meet not meet but to I     
5:10     
don't know like my my sense for the whole it's     
5:17     
really interesting to meet as as a segue into some of the neurom stuff it's really interesting to meet someone who     
5:23     
um had a very sober but not apathetic     
5:30     
which I think is like a very special um mix uh but a silver but not apathetic     
5:38     
take on like Academia and and and     
5:43     
and specifically Boston and what what Boston is in that sense in terms of     
5:48     
Academia in terms of you know building things out and doing things and     
5:54     
getting have like having the the startup culture of Boston and and it it's what     
6:00     
it does and doesn't do and all this stuff um so that that was very interesting and and I'm kind of continuously reflecting in my time here     
6:06     
in that sense um even with a sense that I might not always be in Boston     
6:14     
um but um yeah like as as I said earlier too     
6:20     
it's like one it feels like July is basically over     
6:25     
and August is almost over that's how it feels to me internally yeah and terms of like courses I know when my courses     
6:33     
start my graduate courses start but things here are going to be starting soon uh like students are kind     
6:41     
of the students St in Boston will be returning the things they're like the     
6:47     
activities around the schools will be picking up again the seasons are     
6:53     
are it's you know it's in one sense it's Midsummer and in another sense it's just not um     
7:02     
let's see the last broad thing is um I'm I'm not I'm not going     
7:07     
to make the announcement yet but something really nice happened uh to     
7:14     
someone who's been in in like the society ethics Tech space I put it in     
7:19     
that channel and some other things but um I'm looking forward to like when they     
7:27     
can announce it but it's something that uh is well deserved uh so yeah that's as much as     
7:33     
I'll say for now but that that came through this week as well so I'm happy     
7:39     
for for an I guess an alumni is a fair way to say it     
7:45     
a of that to society ethics Tech group and it's always fun to see     
7:50     
like you know like the sort     
7:57     
of what to to to have a moment of like     
8:03     
savoring um and nice nice nice thoughts specifically     
8:09     
uh I I very much appreciate you in the lab creating spaces for a lot of things     
8:15     
to happen and even creating spaces for me or the people to kind of also create spaces yeah and like like that like     
8:23     
giving giving it that that room to do that and seeing the trickle down effect     
8:28     
for that and I'm not I'm not the reason this big thing happened but it's sort of you get the you get a little bit of     
8:35     
sense of like people pushing in the same direction and it's very cool to     
8:40     
experience that and I think a lot of people don't even get I think many people don't get to experience that in     
8:46     
like a direct way at all no less an indirect way uh so I mean just I'm kind     
8:54     
of being super vague but just passing along General Good Vibes and appreciation for all the stuff that you     
9:01     
know the lab and anything I did was a small part in what happened but um but     
9:09     
you know kudos to to those who maintain spaces so other     
9:16     
people can like explore and have future successes is is is a is a great a great     
9:23     
thing and so um and once again I appreciate your efforts that because     
9:28     
it's been a major part of my life too so uh good cheers and and celebrations to     
9:34     
all for that there's much rejoicing uh for that yeah that's great and I saw that in     
9:40     
the slack and I I don't know that's in reference to but we'll find out I guess eventually so yeah I want I want to I'm     
9:48     
not sure if they want to like they want to be the announcers so I'm kind of waiting for permission for that but I'm     
9:55     
excited so yeah yeah good stuff how about you how you been uh this week well     
10:01     
you know we summer it's summer so we're kind of you know not as busy as we     
10:07     
usually are um I did Monday we did the D.A wor meeting and so that was good we     
10:13     
had a updates there and we had uh you know check that out on YouTube We also     
10:21     
uh you know had the mentorship sessions for nuro match talk about that in a minute and those were interesting and     
10:28     
productive met one person who's really interested in what lab was doing in terms of gibsonian information and Al     
10:35     
estasis machines so um and you know we had to uh not do     
10:43     
the cybernetics reading group because my mentorship sessions were right at the same time so I couldn't do that so um     
10:52     
yeah so we looking forward to some cool things coming out um there's a paper be     
10:58     
coming out IO systems pretty shortly um and this is I'll announce it     
11:04     
when it's out so that's good and other things that are kind of     
11:10     
coming across you know how you prepare papers and then you have to get your um     
11:17     
you know you have to get everything in order you have to get the um you know everything edited and ready to go so we     
11:24     
got some things coming up so Jesse says one thing to talk about later go     
11:29     
diagrams for models of theory and at what level did tailor our audience he I     
11:35     
I'm looking forward to what you saying there there's an airplane here or something yeah you heard     
11:42     
um and looking for the paper and exactly what you said and in the process of thinking about this stuff it reminded me     
11:47     
something did actually happen this week it was a small a small meeting like gu this like mental health mental health     
11:54     
working group uh that a very light     
11:59     
question um and it's about that so we we that can be I think that' be like a     
12:06     
fun deeper dive conversation but we were looking at making like a super simple     
12:13     
like like a primer blog post if you will about something     
12:19     
and had a nice discussion about about that topic so maybe we'll     
12:25     
come back to that later um but but it wasn't really like     
12:32     
it was more of a discussion than like a meeting so it wasn't it was a very light week for me     
12:38     
too but yeah like the you know I look forward to seeing the paper and the     
12:45     
the yes to that process of getting things ready and making choices about     
12:52     
things like di GRS and and and why why     
12:57     
or why not so yeah yeah yeah so okay so     
13:03     
I have a couple things to share the first thing is that we uh Jesse and I are both doing professional development     
13:09     
for neurom match so this is something Jesse posted in the slack it was a image     
13:15     
from uh like a meeting that he went to I didn't go to this meeting but uh this is     
13:21     
for the professional development mentorship sessions so the way they're doing this is they're assigning summer     
13:27     
school participants to to these sessions and you get like an hour time     
13:33     
slot and uh you know you end up uh talking to people about different things     
13:40     
so you know I was in the neuro AI group here number 24 and there were people here in I guess     
13:48     
in computational Neuroscience as well um and so you know I had some good     
13:55     
conversations there with people about uh research you know how to do     
14:01     
research uh how to get into grad school and also some of the work that we've been doing on gibsonan information and     
14:08     
Al estasis machines although we're going to follow up on that in a little bit more detail later and so I sent some     
14:16     
papers out to that effect so that's always good making those kind of connections with people giving them     
14:22     
advice on things um and so the other thing I wanted to share is this this is by paa     
14:30     
and she posted this on the 9th so it was about two weeks ago uh so zura who was     
14:36     
also involved in the lab um he's he's working with paa on this data science     
14:44     
thing that she presented several weeks ago um and so her message here is     
14:50     
greetings Channel together with Zur of this lab and a couple of their peers not yet part of orthogonal and putting     
14:57     
together a funding proposal for an NS SE call we pose and talk about that in a little bit requiring affiliation with a     
15:04     
US research organization the current team member which has a us-based institutional     
15:10     
affiliation does not qualify to put forward the funding proposal because they are not     
15:16     
full-time proposal consists roughly of a project presented here a few weeks ago     
15:21     
which is the thing that Paulo will presented on was the brain uh Imaging or     
15:27     
the U Allen Institute data set that she had uh so this was actually uh brain uh     
15:34     
brain genetics and things like that um if anyone's interested in this     
15:40     
work kindly get in touch to discuss the deadline for the proposal submission is this or     
15:45     
September uh and what we have so far is a concept note and has U have given a couple of talks and     
15:52     
papers okay so yeah then this is this was in the March or the May 11th meeting     
15:59     
that we had so this is at about 33 minutes I guess uh so yeah check that     
16:04     
out if you're interested in finding out more or contact paa or     
16:09     
zura and so what she mentions here is this uh pose Grant or Pathways to enable     
16:16     
open source ecosystems so this is an NSF grant that     
16:22     
uh you know they always have NSF Grant number here so if you're interested in     
16:27     
different types of Grants you know you go by the number and they have all sorts of grants for education for peer     
16:34     
research for Applied research small business grants although that's not really through the NSF and then stuff     
16:41     
like this for enabling open source ecosystems there's some there's another grant that we talked about with respect     
16:48     
to open source education that is I think part of kind     
16:53     
of the same uh program but anyways um so     
16:59     
this is u a grant that supports the facilitation creation and growth of Open     
17:04     
Source ecosystems for the creation of New Technology Solutions so this is I I don't know whe     
17:11     
I haven't read their proposal or their overview but this is basically the     
17:16     
idea uh the pathway to enable open source ecosystems or pose aims to     
17:22     
harness the power of Open Source development for the creation of New Technology Solutions to problems of naal     
17:29     
and societal importance so it means that you know you want to have this sort of     
17:34     
maybe pipeline or architecture that is I guess open source     
17:41     
that allows you to build on these kind of problems many NSF funded projects     
17:47     
result in publicly accessible modifiable and distributable open source products     
17:53     
including software Hardware models specs programming languages or data platforms     
18:00     
that catalyze further Innovation so I mean this sounds more like you want to     
18:05     
actually create software or Hardware you know this is um and so I'm     
18:11     
not really sure what the scope is like if it's just like you know if you're     
18:17     
going to create a set of analyses you know or if you're going to you know if you already have kind of an     
18:23     
existing software platform that you want to improve or you know set of models and     
18:29     
specs that you want to improve uh I guess in this case we'd be more interested in the models and     
18:36     
specifications uh part of this or a data platform although the data platforms are usually things that distribute open     
18:42     
source data you know kind of like tools web tools or uh pieces of software that     
18:48     
do the analysis or apis or something like that so you I'm not really sure how they're     
18:55     
pitching this uh but this is you know this is kind of the way these NSF grants     
19:00     
are written um it's always hard to get the scale right because you know what     
19:06     
how much do you have to propose and how much are they looking for in a certain chunk of proposal so     
19:14     
like for example if I propose something very trivial that might take six months to complete this might not be the right     
19:20     
grant for that I don't know exactly what the length of the grant is the award Etc     
19:27     
so these things are to be determined but I just wanted to go over kind of how these what they're     
19:34     
looking for and kind of you know the idea here     
19:39     
um the general idea so yeah and then there's a translational component here which is     
19:46     
where you know they have of course their Innovation uh NSF Innovation core     
19:52     
partnership for Innovation and the small business Innovation research and small business technology transfer uh programs     
20:00     
so this is again where NSF is sort of sponsoring not only uh grants for open-     
20:05     
Source stuff but also for translational stuff and you know small business uh     
20:12     
spin-offs so things that come out of research so that's where they're kind of going with this um and you know there's     
20:20     
this link between translational stuff and open source so that might be a good     
20:25     
way to you know think about these kinds of things this is due September 5th I think there's a yeah so there's a     
20:32     
rolling deadline annually so you would have first Thursday in September every     
20:39     
year and you know that that's when it would have to be in so you know it's     
20:44     
it's hard to kind of get a grant together you know but what happens typically is people write a grant     
20:49     
they'll kind of prepare it and then maybe reuse it in different uh for     
20:55     
different Grant calls so this looks interesting I don't know if this is something we could do but um you know     
21:01     
it's it's interesting to think about how that might shape you know some activity     
21:07     
going forward what are people really interested in because usually if they want to fund something that means     
21:13     
there's a need for it somewhere so that's you know kind of the reasoning behind that so would definitely be could     
21:19     
be used to shape some of the activities that they want to do around you know     
21:25     
open data and open source this is another thing that came up in     
21:30     
the slack another Grant and I don't know who posted this it could have been Jesse     
21:36     
or um Morgan but this is um from the future of Life Institute and so this     
21:43     
isn't the NSF this is a private U foundation and uh you gonna say     
21:50     
something Jesse oh yeah just uh it looks like a really cool Grant um and I think     
21:57     
I say somewhere in the SM like oh like I wish I don't think I don't think Joe proo is ever G to be able to do this but     
22:06     
it was a sense of because I'm doing so much job like oh yeah I love to have you know organization that could just take     
22:11     
up you know legitimate or put out legitimate to missions to ground like this because it's cool to see such a     
22:17     
tailor one like I think like that's I was laughing when I saw the C     
22:23     
it's like how to mitigate a d power concentration feels a bit like to be like here's a grant on why don't you     
22:30     
figure out how to save the world and figure out all society's like combined technological problems like yeah let's     
22:36     
do that but but no it it was it's a cool um     
22:41     
it's it's very interesting CR and and you know I would love to do more over that I don't know if I can but yeah so     
22:49     
this is you know another thing that you think about when you you know in our society ethics and Tech bace you know     
22:55     
what are people kind of interested in and then just in terms of questions or things that might lead to fundable stuff     
23:03     
or something that people will you know kind of take in as a as an applied     
23:08     
aspect so uh this is how to mitigate AI driven power concentration or offering up to $4     
23:15     
million to support projects that work to mitigate the dangers of Aid driven power     
23:20     
concentration and move towards a better world of meaningful human agency and so     
23:26     
this is just kind of this future of Life Institute which is the fli here they     
23:32     
they're launching these new grants they're positioned on power concentration so power concentration is     
23:39     
just like if I had my hands on AI and I started to a amass power like any     
23:46     
technology would allow me to amass power you know if I control maybe you know     
23:52     
certain aspects of the technology or certain aspects of data sets or whatever     
23:57     
you know then end up with this concentration of power in a very few hands so that's what they're trying to     
24:04     
figure out how to uh mitigate so you know they think about uh we risk     
24:12     
governments tyrannizing with oroian surveillance corporate monopolies crushing gomic freedom and rampant     
24:19     
decision automation subverting meaningful individual ageny so that's a kind those are the kind of things     
24:24     
they're interested in so I mean I don't know like what the the uh proposal would     
24:29     
be for sort of mitigating um some of these things are I     
24:35     
mean they would have to be social interventions I imagine or you know technological interventions although you     
24:41     
know they really would have to I think be at the level of both policy and technological     
24:46     
design but anyways that's the idea that they they want to have people thinking     
24:51     
about this um again you know for $4 million this is something that would     
24:57     
have to be somewhat significant in terms of its scope and it its uh resources brought to it uh Power here     
25:05     
could mean several things it could mean the ownership of a of dec of a decisive proportion of the world's Financial     
25:11     
labor material resources or Le the ability to exploit them it be control of     
25:17     
public attention media narratives or algorithms that decide what information     
25:22     
we received it could simply be a firm grip on political Authority historic L     
25:28     
power has entailed some combination of all three a world where the transformative capabilities of AI are R     
25:35     
unfairly or unwisely likely see most if not all power centers seized clustered     
25:41     
or kept in even fewer hands and so you know there's just I guess a lot of     
25:47     
topics around this truth Decay which is a term uh where you have this Decay and     
25:55     
truthful sources of information uh po surpassing elected governments     
26:02     
stifling monopolies Orwell in levels of surveillance and societal     
26:07     
control social media discourse manipulation and the like so this is you     
26:13     
really kind of one of these uh so I guess when I said uh they offer up to four million in support I     
26:20     
think it's the entire amount that they're willing to disperse for this you know an individual project might be um     
26:27     
you know small chunk of that but I think the idea is you have to find something that's worth funding right I mean you     
26:34     
could write a paper on it and that would be fine but you don't really need funding for that technically so it have     
26:39     
to have some set of infrastructure along with it and I don't know what that would look like     
26:46     
um so uh yeah so what what world would we     
26:52     
prefer to see we need to kind of reimagine our institutions and it's not of structures and technology     
26:59     
development uh open source of AI models is sometimes held as a Panacea the truth     
27:05     
is more nuanced today's leading technology companies have grown and aggregated massive amounts of power even     
27:11     
before generative AI further the benefits of open efforts often still favor entities with the most resources     
27:19     
so you know open source means like if you Fork something and you're a bigger entity you can do more with it than a     
27:25     
smaller entity or if you're Inc you know you create the open- source project the     
27:32     
forks because of their nature can probably do less with it than the organization the sort of the uh Source     
27:40     
organization itself so that's that's kind of the idea here um open source may     
27:47     
be a tool for making some companies less dependent upon others but it is an insufficient uh tool to mitigate the     
27:54     
continued concentration of power meaningfully to uh to put Power in the hands of the     
28:01     
general populace so this is um the topical fosi here uh so one thing     
28:10     
is public AI which AI is developed and deployed outside of the standard corporate mode with greater public     
28:17     
control and accountability and they're looking for Solutions as to how it could work evaluating different approaches and     
28:25     
specifications for a particular public AI system uh there's also AI assistance loyal to     
28:32     
individuals as a counterweight to corporate power safe decentralization or how to     
28:38     
decentralize governance of AI systems and still prevent proliferation of high-risk     
28:44     
systems and again you know you you propose these things and like they're always these counter examples or things     
28:50     
that it could lead to that are not intended so you know if we decentralize governance of AI systems that can     
28:57     
introduce other problem s we have to kind of have a handle on all of the     
29:02     
consequences of doing these sorts of interventions as well as the power of these interventions as well so it's it's     
29:09     
tough thing to kind of you know uh and I guess that's why they're giving out the money they w't to incentivize people to     
29:15     
really kind of build something that's you know well thought out effectiveness of Open     
29:22     
Source uh what is open source mitigated versus increased power concentration     
29:27     
this is an interesting question with respect to some of the things we do with open source     
29:33     
sustainability and that might be something to come back to um but I just     
29:38     
wanted to mention it here uh responsible and safe open release so you know when     
29:44     
you have an open release you know are there safety concerns associated with     
29:50     
that income redistribution incentive design um the infrastructure resource     
29:58     
and knowledge needed to convert AI insights into products that meet true human     
30:03     
needs alignment of economic sociocultural governance forces preference aggregation which are     
30:11     
new mechanisms for Discerning public preferences on social issues Beyond traditional democratic models legal     
30:20     
remedies then this meta which is not the company but uh projects that address the issue of scaling small pilot projects to     
30:28     
break through and a chief impact that's interesting where you kind of build a     
30:34     
pilot project and you say Okay I want to get funding for that now it's uh kind     
30:39     
scale up from there um or you have a small pilot project you want to scale it up which I     
30:46     
think maybe they call it meta because it's kind of not in any of these categories it's all across the     
30:52     
categories then the other met mechanisms to incentivize adoption of decentralized     
30:57     
tools to to achieve a societally significant critical mass actually they give examples of     
31:04     
things that would probably not make compelling proposals so this is like the     
31:10     
things that they don't think are worth funding uh projects that are implicitly or explicitly dismissive of the rapid     
31:17     
enr growth and AI capability or the need for advanced AI systems to be safe or     
31:23     
Technical and scientific realities such as vulnerabilities of AI systems to Jailbreaker guard ra     
31:30     
removal so I guess like you know these are things that you have to take into     
31:36     
account I I don't know I guess you know if you don't take those into account     
31:41     
explicitly or if you imply that they're not a problem you know they're not     
31:47     
interested projects that simply double down on existing anti-concentration mechanisms or processes rather than     
31:54     
innovating approaches addressing the issues created by AI in particular and I'm not sure what that     
32:01     
means I guess that you know don't take things off the shelf and say we can use     
32:06     
this for AI you know and maybe that that's actually something we can do but that's not what they're interested in     
32:13     
here uh projects that equate democratization with just making particular AI capabilities widely     
32:20     
available again taking things off the shelf and saying that they apply to AI I     
32:25     
think they want people to think outside the box is Point projects likely to transfer power     
32:31     
to AI systems themselves rather than people even if decentralize uh so you don't want things     
32:37     
going from AI system to AI system you don't want to use an AI system for example to mitigate the effects of AI     
32:44     
systems uh they want a social component of this projects that aren't focused on AI either as a driver of the problem or     
32:51     
the solutions so they really want to do um they want people to think about     
32:59     
this in terms of the social impacts have a role for AI and then think about like     
33:05     
the problems specific to so they usually don't provide these kind of direct you     
33:10     
know uh directions that are not compelling in a grant call like we saw at the NSF call they don't really tell     
33:17     
you what's not compelling and this is actually useful because it really does frame like what your how you approach     
33:22     
the problem so you know I like this where you just kind of tell people okay this this isn't really what we're     
33:28     
looking for we're looking for something that is uh you know more focused on     
33:35     
certain things so this is um you know they're     
33:41     
really kind of looking for people to create a specific tool to be scaled up at a later date coordinate a group of     
33:48     
actors to tackle a set problem technical research reports a new system so that     
33:53     
means what do what's the what product that you want to produce for the amount of money that giving you policy research     
34:01     
General operating support for existing organizations doing work in this space then funding for specific new     
34:07     
initiatives or even new organizations these are all like maybe infrastructural things or they're you     
34:14     
know basically creating policy maybe creating Technologies and maybe you know kind of     
34:20     
thinking about how to organize that socially what what you know kind of     
34:26     
Institutions do we need for this what does that look like how do we scale that     
34:31     
up um and so yeah there this is kind of they the deadline for the first round of     
34:38     
proposals is July 30th so that's probably not something that's doable now but there you know I imagine they'll do     
34:45     
this again and again annually um so yeah it's it's a interesting set of things in     
34:53     
terms of Grants I I we haven't talked about grants in a long time I'm glad that people have been posting on this kind of     
35:00     
thinking about that now we can't really go for a grant in the organization here for reasons that we don't have the     
35:06     
status that we need um but we can do this through other mechanisms if we need to and for something like a private     
35:13     
organization I think we can probably do maybe something like that but it's not clear to me how you know how we would     
35:21     
what what kinds of organization we need to be to manage that so um yeah but any     
35:29     
comments or questions especially about the second one I know Jesse's especially with respect to     
35:34     
society ethics and Tech you know that might be something to think about yeah I mean it's it's um I think I     
35:43     
mean the topic is like super relevant to everything but at the same time     
35:52     
um I it sort of feels a little aspirational     
35:58     
in the sense of well not I mean it is um but but like for myself     
36:05     
of I think a goal of mine would be one day to I don't know if it would be make my     
36:12     
own organization that could receive that and like the like I don't know if I'm ever going to be getting like a million     
36:17     
dollar grants for my own stuff specifically but but I'm definitely interested in in learning how to to deal     
36:24     
with that like like that's sort of a um I think it's what I sort of asked     
36:31     
Morgan who's I think here now like like like I'm I'm interested in getting more     
36:36     
experience in that space just because um I find it to be I find I don't     
36:44     
there's this whole um I don't really know what what to call     
36:51     
it and I don't know that it has like I think there I think maybe the     
36:57     
closest thing to it would be sort of I mean grant writing is a term that comes     
37:03     
to mind uh but but like like the and I know like doing the like tenure track     
37:10     
like a big part of everything is like securing grants like that's that's I was I have a colleague     
37:16     
who a couple months ago was like oh I have a major um R1 deadline or ro1 I     
37:22     
forget what it's called to to get like some major major major funding for like five years or something like that     
37:28     
um and like I I get that process of like asking for funds from a university or     
37:33     
like the NSF and things like that but um     
37:40     
I I feel like I don't know there's there's a     
37:45     
whole um and it's weird because I'm I'm I'm     
37:50     
I'm kind of I think I feel like I'm on the perimeters of it both acade like in     
37:56     
terms of straight Academia or the startup and the whole like Venture Capital Ling and Angel Investors and     
38:01     
that whole like more get the startup and get funding and fund fund your like I     
38:08     
think there was some Tony Tony Robins say fund fund your dream or like how to get your moonshot and it's sort of like     
38:13     
this array of um you know different processes to get     
38:19     
things off the ground and get the money behind it and do Stu like that and it's it's very interesting for me just as a     
38:25     
sort of personal share on it as like sometimes I wonder about going more     
38:30     
intentionally into that space But then it's it's sort of this it's sort of like the Divide     
38:36     
between being a manager of people doing research versus doing the research or or     
38:41     
or like are you are you leading people to to apply their like is it like in the     
38:47     
software development sense like a lot of uh they come like the the I guess     
38:54     
it's the common thing but like the um you know what when when you're the     
38:59     
developer yourself and you're doing the research to how to develop something you can become the expert in it but you're     
39:05     
not you're not necessarily having the most leadership about how it's implemented versus when you're doing     
39:12     
management or policy or higher level decision- making your strategy you're not dealing with it every day at the the     
39:19     
minutia level and becoming an expert at in certain ways I it's kind of that tradeoff even at this level of like     
39:25     
Grant and stuff because I don't I don't know I I have different feelings about     
39:30     
where I want to be in the process but I also feel like I want to get more literacy of it as a whole over all to um     
39:37     
because I think it's sort of um it affects the difference between you     
39:42     
know um is it is it you     
39:50     
know some some things require funding and money money to do in certain ways     
39:55     
and some things don't and and and with kind of directly and indirectly we we're constantly talking to that in the lab um     
40:02     
you know from open source direct you know commentary or to just you know how how things work at a broad level so it's     
40:10     
an interesting topic I don't I don't have any real conclusions about it but um I appreciate going over it here     
40:16     
today Yeah well yeah I think that's something     
40:22     
that you know we have to think about not just from the standpoint of like getting     
40:28     
the funding but like how the kinds of things that people are interested in like the when you think     
40:36     
about frontiers of research what kinds of things are people really kind of the questions that people are interested in     
40:43     
finding out more about so if you want your research to be relevant you know what kinds of things can we at least     
40:51     
address in the research to make oh people can recognize that say oh yeah that's a societal need that might be     
40:58     
something or it might be relevant to you know applications or things that people     
41:03     
other people are dealing with really does give you that sort of yes     
41:10     
relevance very much so and like I think I think if I had sort of a I don't know if I want this to be my main career I     
41:17     
guess I guess this this is to that clarifies my point a little bit like in the sense of a version of myself would     
41:24     
love to be almost this sort of uh     
41:30     
diplomatic um word like fixer comes to mind too but     
41:36     
like like someone who can take really good projects that are not like like     
41:44     
there's there's the work of making it relevant and using the terms that people care about in whatever the moment is     
41:50     
like the like a lot of generic funding right now especially in in Boston spaces     
41:56     
but like in in any kind of a tech whatever related space it's sort of the AI and then the Gen AI like who have the     
42:02     
Gen AI like there's there just like ridiculous you know that's the a hype     
42:08     
word at a specific level of understanding especially consumer facing things that's gen this I don't I don't     
42:14     
even know if they mentioned gen in this degree or not I forgot I didn't I don't remember but like it's it's a different     
42:19     
set of things that this institution is looking for and a different sort of like the keywords and the coding and the     
42:25     
phrasing are different but like understanding that um if I had like an infinite you know time and could just     
42:32     
develop a different skill set I would do that because I feel like that's such a that affects so much and in very good     
42:39     
projects it's almost like basically being a lawyer like like you can you could have someone who didn't do any     
42:46     
wrong uh but if they can't defend themselves or explain themselves or you know use the language of the law to     
42:52     
justify why um then it then it it doesn't matter or if they have a great idea same thing     
42:59     
like that they won't they won't be Savvy enough     
43:05     
um you know it's sort of like that literacy like there's a grant writing     
43:10     
and and funding literacy that just is sort of like you're going to need it um     
43:17     
and and even then like it's not guaranteed you know it's it's kind of a you know but but that that that that     
43:23     
stands out to me so much and is sort of um it's this weird dynamic too of like     
43:29     
you you have to kind of be literate in the system as it exists even if you want to change the system so that that's a     
43:37     
very common theme in in many areas that I'm in so     
43:44     
yeah uh Morgan     
43:52     
hello if you're available to talk right now but uh welcome to meeting we've been     
43:58     
talking about op or we've been talking about different Grant proposals that have been put in the uh slack there's an     
44:06     
NSF proposal for open source uh enabling open source uh     
44:13     
artifacts and then this AI driven open source related thing that we just talked     
44:21     
about so that's um you know I think there's a lot there that we     
44:27     
can learn yeah good morning but that's something we can yeah     
44:32     
I guess save for another time as we go along so Jesse you said that you were     
44:37     
interested in this question here um drawing good diagrams for models     
44:43     
of theory so yeah could we could talk a little bit about that what's your idea     
44:50     
there um I wish I could so um     
44:59     
like this is the kind of thing that'd be great to to if I could share my screen somehow and show I don't know if I can     
45:05     
do it uh the way because like it's very much a thing where if if you've done it you know exactly what it is and you     
45:11     
don't look at anything but if you're a new person coming to it which is sort of what I was the comics that may have a     
45:18     
discussion with people who aren't familiar with it so um but I mean at its     
45:23     
core to speak to speak from people with experience about it um it's about just     
45:31     
choosing diagrams like like like the art of choosing the diagram relative to the     
45:36     
audience relative to the point you're making um and and and comparing them and     
45:42     
you know maybe even make like this is even like at just a almost like a literature review level but also like     
45:48     
creating a diagram um and the nature of doing that um sorry hold on a second     
45:55     
here one     
46:06     
second that's too bad I might have have an issue with one of my emails     
46:12     
um     
46:19     
um so I mean if I let me see if I can um     
46:30     
pull up a screen to     
46:35     
show what I'm talking about a little bit yeah this will this will kind of work so     
46:40     
in the context of some of the things the mental health working group's looking     
46:47     
at all right all right um so in the context of this like we were we they     
46:53     
just pull up a super General General like just search for IFS or internal family models and we're talking about     
47:00     
how do we explain explain like if we're making a very simple introduction blog post about     
47:08     
let's say ifs that's not what we're doing but like if you're just explaining it or making making like internal     
47:13     
materials to explain it to somebody um like what he use and what are the benefits of these different different     
47:19     
ways of talking about it like um I'll do this even to make it better     
47:29     
um like this is this is a I don't know if you can see this super well on the screen yeah but     
47:36     
um this is this is like a a very nice I could like it's a nice what's nice about     
47:44     
this model like even outside of the words is it it's sort of this choice of     
47:50     
representing the relationship to these components in this case you have according to the theory or one one     
47:57     
interpretation of this there you have these sort of three groups managers     
48:03     
firefighters and Exiles and you have core self which is this other sort of     
48:09     
component and in the way that this is made you kind of see okay this component this component this component they're     
48:15     
all around this thing in the middle so there must be some kind of relationship to that um and that that's that's sort     
48:21     
of nice um and and the the words are maybe more for     
48:27     
uh like more textbook or higher level stuff um but but the one of the things     
48:33     
that came up in the discussion was like what's what's cool like compared to this this thing this is a different topic but     
48:40     
here you kind of see all these things around one thing um this is sort of that     
48:46     
same um there's an expression of a relationship it's it's like kind of like     
48:52     
mind mapping in general but like there's these these components are Center around something else and that sort of implies     
48:59     
a relationship here's sort of another take on that you have oh this sort of triple triple yinyang modified type     
49:06     
around this thing in the middle um and and and you know like this sort of     
49:12     
taking away from the cover the book has a similar design for ifs and they just     
49:17     
kind of talking about like when you're making a model or evaluating what what when you're making a graph a     
49:23     
visualization is the better way to say it um how like all these different ways to     
49:29     
convey that like here's a different take like this is this the fact that they're overlapping here in this sort of generic     
49:36     
V diagram kind of conveys something slightly different than than this one     
49:41     
you know it's like oh well there's there's more intermeshing things here and so on and so forth so it was just     
49:46     
this this conversation that came up this week about um you know who's the     
49:52     
audience at what level you know at what level things need to be specific um and realizing too that when when you're     
49:59     
choosing a diagram um or when you're choosing to visualize a a model or how a theory     
50:06     
works you you have to make choices about it um and one of the things we discussed     
50:14     
in in the the group um or you know had had a brief commentary on I suppose was     
50:24     
um you you know let go back to this sort of like very conventional one um or this     
50:32     
higher level one like you have to make choices and and     
50:38     
depending on the goal like in in in in a paper ideally you can you can make     
50:45     
something very clear that at least illustrates a point like especially if     
50:51     
you're ining a New Concept putting in a paper at the level or like a free print     
50:56     
uh it is sort of a way to crystallize some of the relationships between the     
51:02     
components that you're trying to talk about when but and that's sort of towards a very specific audience towards     
51:09     
a literate people literate in in that you know um you're you're speaking to a     
51:15     
specific Community um same thing like if you're writing uh whether it's a a     
51:21     
curriculum for a a a student at undergraduate graduate you know earlier     
51:27     
levels or an internal document where some people will have some exposure but but you're trying to educate internally     
51:33     
these are all very different um sort of goals or or things to keep in mind when     
51:40     
you're conveying information and they have different kinds of tradeoffs for like     
51:47     
this is you know this this is really good for kind of presenting some of the     
51:53     
framework and in this case using higher Lev terminology for someone who doesn't have any idea this might be might be way     
52:01     
too overwhelming for them to do like here's here's a much more uh a different way of talking about it that's like um     
52:09     
more personification or uh um anthropomorphic takes even on on these     
52:16     
sort of components of the theory and and it's sort of like the art of just     
52:21     
getting people aware of essentially opportunity cost I guess is a word you could use here     
52:27     
but just why or why not something is chosen and and and maybe even in certain     
52:33     
context explaining especially if you're using an existing Mo an existing Theory     
52:38     
or an existing model or or visualization of a theory or visualization of of of     
52:45     
you know a part of a theory or whatever why like being able to explain why that     
52:50     
works and maybe explaining why or at least offering hey this is really nice and explains this point but what what     
52:56     
this visualization in particular doesn't get is XYZ and kind of just bringing     
53:03     
that getting acclamation to the language around that uh that that's sort of     
53:08     
that's what the discussion was about um but it's sort of a longer um pedagogical     
53:15     
and and and and um you know there there's different strategies to apply     
53:23     
about it and different it's it's kind of like in the it's the art of of of doing     
53:30     
the sort of knowledge building and and a little bit of a little bit of throwback to us all the the old there was some     
53:35     
stuff in the epistemological directories stuff or I saw that slack Channel again so kind of this this like uh you know     
53:43     
how do you how do you do that how do you teach it stuff but yeah that that's sort of what the discussion was about well     
53:49     
that's great uh yeah it's interesting I have some words about that as well so     
53:55     
the first is that you're trying to take an idea and you're trying to boil it down to um you know some easy to digest     
54:04     
pieces so as you saw you know you take like an idea and you say what components     
54:11     
we break this down into you know sometimes you want to characterize different     
54:16     
archetypes sometimes categories so often times I'll take like an idea and I'll     
54:22     
summarize it into four boxes or four quadrants those quadrants will have different things going on in and that     
54:29     
summarizes my idea quite well and this is a lot of times this is what we'll do a theory building which is where we want     
54:36     
to sort of take a bunch of data a bunch of input and we want to create like a     
54:43     
model that describes everything we're going to observe so we might have for     
54:49     
example you know uh four archetypes that we break our Theory down into and we     
54:55     
kind of character ize that in these four quadrants and we visualize it by putting some descriptor in each quadrant and     
55:03     
then you know it's easy for people to follow that diagram and say okay this is     
55:08     
archetype one archetype two archetype three archetype 4 so that's one way to do that and you     
55:16     
have you know um you can easily you know say okay my theory is basically fitting     
55:23     
things into these four bins or these eight bins and so you know what they were doing     
55:28     
with the like the little cartoon people was just putting a face on those archetypes which is Vine that's great     
55:36     
that's something that you know there's also the aspect of um you know kind of     
55:41     
bringing that home to people like what does this archetype represent is it like a thing in our type of thing we're     
55:49     
system we're interested in or you know is it just this abstract concept we don't really want to make it that     
55:55     
abstract and Theory we want to kind of ground it in the real world or at least     
56:02     
you know if it's a psychological theory we want to ground it in like cognition or the brain or something that people     
56:08     
are doing if it's a biological Theory we want to ground it into biology so you know a lot of times with     
56:16     
like systems biology we do these analyses or you know sometimes with     
56:21     
machine learning as well we get these outputs um that that are dimensionality     
56:28     
reductions um and you know like methods like umap or some of these other     
56:35     
visualization techniques where we see these pretty pictures where you have all these dots and they kind of form     
56:41     
clusters but they're not really clusters that's something it's really hard to interpret so you can use these     
56:47     
kind of diagrams to like help with that interpretability and say you know this is basically what this visualization     
56:54     
represents and then have a diag where you have archetypes or maybe you know you kind of     
57:00     
augment the analysis somewhere and I've done that in papers where you know you're kind of trying to explain an idea     
57:08     
based on some out you know output of data so we have our data we have our     
57:14     
output this is what our output should look like this is how you would interpret that     
57:21     
output um another thing you know about the more specific to Theory building     
57:26     
is doing those kind of graphs you know drawing a graph maybe like a biar     
57:33     
graph and then explaining like what does the B variate graph uh represent so what     
57:40     
is a typical bivariate graph look like in this Theory or like an outcome of     
57:46     
this Theory and what should it look like what is the pattern we want to see so     
57:51     
like in some Theory you might predict that like two of your variables might be     
57:57     
related you know there's an independent variable and a dependent variable and then there's some relationship that you     
58:03     
seek in this Theory like you said there's a linear relationship between X     
58:09     
and Y we predict that X and Y can be derived from the data that we want to     
58:14     
collect or you know if we create variables based on what we're trying to     
58:20     
do we're trying to get a measurement so we go and we get that measurement various ways we can create these X and Y     
58:28     
variables and then we can plot them out and we get this linear relationship or this you know logarithmic relationship     
58:36     
or whatever so ideally that you know that's that's kind of like where you think     
58:41     
about your theory when you think about the quantitative consequences of that theory so like what is the     
58:48     
consequence of that theory in terms of the you know what the pattern is that     
58:54     
you want to to predict so you know you have these uh graphical     
59:01     
representations which are kind of conceptual with is graphical representations which are based more on     
59:07     
like quantitative data or predicted relationships and then there's this     
59:13     
thing that um there's a systems biologist by the name of Rob Thomas and he's at     
59:19     
keltech and he gave he's given presentations on this idea of figure     
59:24     
seven so like in a standard science paper in a biology paper you typically     
59:31     
you know start out with figure one which is maybe like a very vague description     
59:37     
of the problem and that's like one of these diagrams where you just basically you     
59:43     
know maybe break things into archetypes where you introduce your problem maybe the methods you're using and you     
59:49     
visualize all that out so like this is where you're just stating what you're doing you're stating your problem you're     
59:56     
doing something that's very general a very general level and then you go through your paper     
1:00:02     
and you have figure two three four five six and those are usually all data     
1:00:07     
related so in this case you know we're talking about a paper where you're collecting data analyzing the data     
1:00:13     
putting out figures that you know maybe explore different hypotheses or explore     
1:00:19     
different relationships or whatever so those are 2 three four five six usual     
1:00:25     
you can have more but the idea being that a standard scientific paper of a standard length is going to have maybe     
1:00:32     
you know five figures that are based on the data and now it leads us to figure     
1:00:38     
seven and so figure seven is basically taking figure     
1:00:44     
one and then thinking about figures two through six and then kind of merging those     
1:00:51     
together so it's like you know you you start out with this very vague idea of what you're doing what you want to do     
1:00:57     
two through six is the data and then seven is like the summary of you know     
1:01:04     
what the data mean in the context of your idea and so figure seven should be     
1:01:09     
this elaborate sort of overview of bringing it all     
1:01:14     
home I like that model because it's very straightforward in terms of how to     
1:01:20     
outline a paper how to outline a document even where you can say okay we're going to start very generally     
1:01:25     
we're going to give people a basic idea of what we want to do we want to go     
1:01:31     
through and like break down break this down into certain relationships you know key relationships and it doesn't have to     
1:01:37     
be hypothesis testing per se it can just be like in a theory paper for example um     
1:01:44     
you know it could be like a very general sketch of what we might expect from the theory what the theory is what it     
1:01:51     
involves and then you know two through six might be you know expected     
1:01:56     
relationships they could be like what we expect to see in measurements measurement predictions uh     
1:02:03     
they might be just kind of like different uh you know specific parts of     
1:02:08     
the theory that you know we might sketch up the theory say more detail we might take our four archetypes and break it     
1:02:14     
down into 16 or we might have the four archetypes and might explore each archetype in terms of what they     
1:02:22     
involve so like with Jesse was showing what the text that text you know is really     
1:02:28     
descriptive but we can take each one of those bullet points of text and break it down     
1:02:34     
into um different pieces you know what what does it     
1:02:39     
mean and you know what what are they all involve because they probably involve each of those bullet points involve some     
1:02:45     
visualization itself and you can just break that down into you know finer and     
1:02:51     
finer grains of detail and then finally your figure seven or whatever the summary figure is     
1:02:58     
you know the numbering isn't that important the idea is that you have this figure one you have this last figure and     
1:03:03     
everything in between should be like kind of breaking it down and then in that last figure you bring everything     
1:03:09     
together so that's where the synthesis happens you can describe that synthesis and you know kind of give more     
1:03:15     
insight into what you've just talked about summarizing so that's I mean that's kind     
1:03:22     
of the the way I think about this and you know in terms of theory building you know you you want to have a lot of     
1:03:28     
diagrams you want to have a lot of graphical relationships not necessarily Based on data but to show what those     
1:03:35     
relationships should be so you know in dorm recently we've     
1:03:41     
been talking a lot about networks and network Theory one of the things you can do Network theory is generate hypothetical     
1:03:48     
graph structures so a lot of times in network Theory people will generate like random     
1:03:53     
graphs as sort of like your default or your sort of Baseline and then the idea     
1:04:01     
is that you want to maybe come up with a graph topology that isn't random maybe it's a small world Network     
1:04:08     
which we talked about in d a couple weeks ago it could be a scale-free network it could be a regular Network     
1:04:15     
structure all which deviate from that uh random graph structure and so if you're     
1:04:22     
proposing a theory you might say okay uh my random graph and I'll give you an     
1:04:28     
example of one is the sort of the Baseline it's the control condition and     
1:04:35     
then I have maybe a small world Network and that looks like this and we can draw     
1:04:41     
a line between the random Network and the small world Network and we can explain then you know in cases where we     
1:04:48     
expect something to maybe go either evolve from a random Network to a small     
1:04:54     
world Network or deviate from the random Network in the small world     
1:04:59     
fashion what kinds of things drive that process why is it     
1:05:04     
different and you can draw a diagram say random Network small world Network some     
1:05:09     
information about why it deviates and have that in a graphical form so that people can say oh yeah okay well there's     
1:05:16     
this change that happens or this difference that happens in between you know a control condition and an     
1:05:23     
experimental condition that describ you know then we can describe why that     
1:05:28     
is or at least what we expect so you know these aren't like this isn't like     
1:05:34     
hard and fast explanation this is like our prediction what we expect and then     
1:05:40     
you have the uh random Network and maybe a scale free network and the same thing holds true there you can just say why is     
1:05:46     
this different why should we expect this to be different and so on and so you can do all this in in these graphs you could     
1:05:54     
have like a figure one where where you say we expect the random Network to differ from these other types of     
1:06:00     
networks you get at figures 2 through six which are like kind of exploring     
1:06:05     
each of these like things in detail so you might say there's there are two cases where we     
1:06:11     
expect uh like a small world Network to deviate from a random Network we go through the first case go through the     
1:06:18     
second case we build diagrams for each of those cases and maybe there's some intermediate stuff that we need to cover     
1:06:25     
and in visualize you know maybe there's some social process or some biological     
1:06:31     
process that's contributing to this change or you know something that we expect there to be a difference why is     
1:06:37     
there a difference so we do this for each of these cases and then the final figure we     
1:06:42     
have this much more elaborate explanation maybe or this much more elaborate diagram while we kind of go     
1:06:48     
through these differences we list them out and then maybe we give some exceptions may we give some examples of     
1:06:57     
by variant relationships of life so that's a nice neat description of that     
1:07:03     
whole process and building a theory around this this this set of     
1:07:09     
ideas uh the final thing I wanted to point out was that like you know when you look at a diagram there's a lot of     
1:07:16     
like visualization techniques that people use or you know communication     
1:07:22     
techniques that people use to optimize these things so you know uh systems     
1:07:28     
biology papers for example are notorious for having these     
1:07:33     
really uh sometimes inscrutable um figures where they have     
1:07:40     
like 50 panels and you know it's like you have like letters and they have so many     
1:07:47     
letters they have to like start over with like small letters and primes and     
1:07:52     
um but the idea there is you know you want fit all of your information on one     
1:07:57     
figure and maybe that's not the best way to do it um so they're different figure     
1:08:03     
you know there are different strategies for laying out information so that it's easy to follow     
1:08:08     
and and it certainly you can have a lot of panels in your figure but making it easy to kind of follow through all of     
1:08:15     
those figure variations um is is good um so yeah I mean that's and so but     
1:08:23     
even when you don't do that like when you have something like which you were showing with the c you know the circular     
1:08:29     
diagram and breaking it up into pieces and and quadrants or you know parts of     
1:08:34     
the Arc of the circle you know having that kind of in a neat way you know not     
1:08:40     
maybe putting too much text in each space is good or you know having more     
1:08:48     
sort of images instead of words is also good just really depends on your     
1:08:54     
audience too your audience is more like familiar with jargon you could put     
1:08:59     
jargon on there maybe it's not a great idea but you know there are a lot of ways you can kind     
1:09:06     
of you know optimize your graph for different audiences so that's all I have to say on     
1:09:12     
that I think that's kind of an overview of like my thoughts on     
1:09:22     
it uh yeah I mean this it's     
1:09:27     
it's it's always so interesting to me to think about both     
1:09:32     
like this sort of this um way     
1:09:38     
of like the the the common ground for all the stuff is like trying to     
1:09:43     
express trying to make the way the different components     
1:09:49     
relate to each other accessible but then it's     
1:09:56     
in within the the audience and the experience level and the are are you you     
1:10:02     
know who who are you talking to and what do they know and like what's what's the bridge what's the bridging of it like     
1:10:09     
that that's that's just what constantly um is on my mind about that     
1:10:15     
it's own it's its own sort of it's it's all I could say it's like its own art uh     
1:10:21     
and there's some rules and some guidance and and there's clearly better and worse ways to do it um but yeah it's it's it's     
1:10:31     
I I I always I think it's a nice thing to talk about because it's sort of thinking about this is sort of something     
1:10:37     
that that changes it's sort of like um you know the difference between     
1:10:45     
hearing some a nice piece of music or something on the radio then realizing what it takes to make it and I think I     
1:10:53     
think when you're going to bringing bringing students or Learners of people into the realm of like knowledge     
1:10:59     
creation supp to just consuming stuff that people have like predigested and like okay remember remember remember     
1:11:06     
this because people chose it and it's the right way to do it as opposed to like getting them into the thinking     
1:11:11     
about it and I think that's really key [Music]     
1:11:17     
um it's sort of a key part of that process uh so it's good     
1:11:23     
to talk about yeah yeah so I've been really meaning to     
1:11:29     
put some Theory building videos together and have not had time to do that I might actually try to do that because I think     
1:11:35     
there's a maybe an interest in that um certainly you know other people kind of     
1:11:41     
approach this but there's a really a plcity of information out there about     
1:11:46     
like this process and it's not something that I mean there books on it but they're not uh like it's not a common     
1:11:54     
topic that you have uh it's not like you know learning about different methodologies or you     
1:12:00     
know uh even like the philosophy of science it's it's very obscure     
1:12:06     
so yeah that that's maybe more to come on that so I have some papers to go over     
1:12:12     
uh this first one is a paper I think was posted in the slack this is a bioarchive     
1:12:18     
paper uh this is called problem solving as a language computational lens into human     
1:12:24     
and monkey intelligence so this is really kind of you know in in     
1:12:31     
the uh cybernetics paper that we've been working on we had this set of readings I     
1:12:38     
think it was from Fran chle about what is intelligence and then we talked about another paper on you know defining     
1:12:45     
intelligence and they really struggle to Define intelligence because as it turns     
1:12:50     
out it's not very well defined I mean the typical psychological definitions of     
1:12:57     
intelligence have been sort of you know um we talked about this where they're     
1:13:03     
kind of based on pre-scientific Concepts where they're not really based on the same kind of they're not aligned     
1:13:10     
very well and then you know you're applying that to artificial systems and it's kind of hard to get a handle on     
1:13:17     
what exactly it means to be kind of intelligent or what parts of you know     
1:13:23     
intelligence are really key to looking at something like humanlike intelligence     
1:13:29     
and so forth so this paper is about problem solving as a language and this     
1:13:34     
is going to involve human and monkey intelligence I think it's a cross species study but it's also this     
1:13:41     
computational lens so I'm I'm really curious about what this paper is involving so this is these are this is a     
1:13:49     
Chinese group and uh someone also from the UK     
1:13:55     
um so that's uh the group um and then     
1:14:01     
the abstract reads human intelligence is characterized by a remarkable ability to solve complex problems so that's our     
1:14:08     
definition of human intelligence or at least one aspect of it is where there's this remarkable ability to solve complex     
1:14:16     
problems now it's not really you know I mean other species solve complex     
1:14:21     
problems uh chimp solve complex problems or other species where they're doing all     
1:14:26     
sorts of complex navigation and things like that but for now that's kind of the     
1:14:31     
the point that they're making here this involves planning a sequence of actions that leads us from an initial state to a     
1:14:38     
desired goal state so this statement right here is sort of the basis for sort     
1:14:44     
of modern cognitive science um you know modern cognitive science really focuses on sequential     
1:14:51     
learning and sequential knowledge and putting those things into practice and then doing well directed stuff so if     
1:14:58     
you're thinking about memory models of memory models of uh attention models of     
1:15:04     
like sensory motor integration those are all sort of goal directed things that     
1:15:10     
involve a sequence of actions we model that sequence um for the squal out and     
1:15:16     
then we get this bu directed thing so I mean it's interesting to think about this maybe not in so much of a cognitive     
1:15:23     
science framework but to sort of think about this is maybe not the case like     
1:15:29     
for example you know we think about intelligence we think about this very thing the statement and we think about     
1:15:35     
solving complex problems but maybe intelligence is not just about that maybe there are other things that     
1:15:41     
involves but anyways uh that's they're coming this is how they're coming at     
1:15:46     
this quantifying and comparing problem solving capabilities across species and     
1:15:52     
finding its and they say evolutional Roots but it's evolutionary uh is a fundamental     
1:15:57     
challenge in cognitive science and is critical for understanding how the brain carries out this incate process so again     
1:16:04     
this is kind of thinking about sort of The evolutionary roots of of problem solving     
1:16:10     
capabilities and kind of you know thinking cross species but also using a computational model to kind of come at     
1:16:18     
this so in this study we introduced the language of problem solving model which is the wops model as a novel     
1:16:25     
quantitative framework that investigates the structure of problemsolving behavior through a language model so they're     
1:16:31     
using a lar I guess a larger language model um to look at the structure of problem solving Behavior     
1:16:38     
okay um that's that's where we're introducing this as sort of this quantitative     
1:16:44     
framework now of course with a language model you have to train it on something so can't just be like its own thing so     
1:16:52     
this is where the process species comparison comes in so we adapted the     
1:16:58     
classic Pac-Man game as a cross species behavioral Paradigm so this Pac-Man game     
1:17:04     
that they've developed is something that both humans and monkeys can do I guess     
1:17:10     
maacs can uh participate in so this is a     
1:17:15     
behavioral Paradigm that can test both humans and maccak monkeys using the lops     
1:17:20     
model then we extracted the Weighton structure or grammar embedded in the agent gameplay so this is where we're     
1:17:27     
actually looking at the agent gameplay and then they extract this latent structure of the grammar and then this     
1:17:34     
actually reveals a non- Marian temporal structure so this is uh something we're     
1:17:39     
going to talk about in another paper this non-markovian model so a maravian     
1:17:45     
model is where you have discrete States and they transitions between states and     
1:17:50     
there's no memory to this model so it's a model that has no memory there's just this transition between states in a non     
1:17:58     
marvian model you have this temporal structure that's sort of linked to uh dependence on previous     
1:18:06     
condition so it's not Arian in the sense that it it's kind of a you know it I     
1:18:12     
don't know if you'd call it pseudo random but there's no expectation for the previous state so this is where you     
1:18:19     
know it's not not basian it's non Marian so that's that's kind of the structure     
1:18:25     
that they're looking at of their problem solving Behavior so basically problem solving relies on prior States on memory     
1:18:33     
and then that's reflected in the sort of this behavioral states that emerge or the     
1:18:39     
grammar the wops model captures fine grained individual differences among the players and revealed the Striking     
1:18:46     
differences in the complexity and hierarchical organizational problem solving Behavior between humans and     
1:18:53     
monkeys and so there's this complexity and hierarchical organization of the behavior and there differences that     
1:19:00     
exist as we might expect re reflecting the distinct cognitive capabilities of     
1:19:06     
each species furthermore both humans and monkeys evolve their lops grammar during     
1:19:11     
learning so these lops grammar are the grammars when you train the model it can find these this latent structure of the     
1:19:18     
problem the solutions that the maacs and humans are using and then they generate     
1:19:24     
grammar so this uh this these grammars evolve     
1:19:29     
during learning progressing from simpler to more complex ones suggesting that the language of problem solving is not fixed     
1:19:36     
so this is where we have this language of sort of this grammar of problem solving and it's not fixed it actually     
1:19:44     
evolves to support more sophisticated and efficient problem solving so over     
1:19:49     
the course of learning and you know you're using they're using evolved here in two different ways they say up here     
1:19:55     
that it's like there's this these evolutionary roots of problem solving     
1:20:01     
which means that humans and maacs as primates they share maybe a     
1:20:07     
common uh basic substrate for Learning and then of course humans and maacs have     
1:20:14     
their own abilities for learning own sort of intelligent behavior that is     
1:20:19     
derived from that common ancestry but then of course you have this use of a D     
1:20:25     
meaning that when you engage in a task when you learn the structure of the task     
1:20:31     
how do you master that structure and how does that reflect the intelligent Behavior that's generated by that so     
1:20:39     
that's what they these two uses have evolved I wanted to clarify that but this means that you know basically when     
1:20:46     
humans and monkeys are both engaging in this test of playing this game they generate this kind of uh model of the     
1:20:54     
game they they generate ways to solve problems in the game and they generate this grammar that is     
1:21:01     
naroian that's you know biasing itself over time as they learn more and more     
1:21:07     
about the game to these more sophisticated and efficient problem solving     
1:21:13     
abilities through the lens of a language model our study provides insights into how humans and monkeys break down     
1:21:19     
problem solving into compositional units and navigate complex test so this     
1:21:25     
compositional units aspect is important because you know one of the things about     
1:21:30     
AI is that or AI systems is that they're you know to achieve intelligence a lot     
1:21:37     
of people say well you know intelligence is compositional or you know acquiring     
1:21:42     
information is compositional and that basically means that you're composing intelligence out of different things so     
1:21:49     
you're composing it say out of different types you know pieces of information that you're acquiring     
1:21:55     
and then integrating that into a larger model so you have these you know problem solving is broken down the compositional     
1:22:03     
units so basically if a monkey sees like the Pac-Man game they notice that like     
1:22:09     
if you move the Pac-Man away from the ghost you survive so they you to understand that and they understand that     
1:22:15     
you can maximize maybe your score by eating more pellets or you know whatever     
1:22:21     
they just these different pieces that are sort of learned as you engage in the     
1:22:27     
task and then they're all put together somehow to master the task and so that's     
1:22:32     
what they're kind of finding here and of course there's a parallel between these compositional units and this grammar and     
1:22:39     
so the grammar is actually you know the sort of putting those compositional     
1:22:45     
units together this framework deepens our understanding of human intelligence and     
1:22:50     
its Evolution and establishes a foundation for future investigation of the neuromechanisms of problem     
1:22:57     
solving all right so yeah this is very reminiscent of a lot of the cross species stuff that you know people do     
1:23:03     
with in Neuroscience those are always fun because it's like you know you get to see like sort of the commonalities     
1:23:11     
and differences between different species it's very hard you know kind of hard to draw insights from it you know     
1:23:18     
other than that they're different right so this is something that I think     
1:23:23     
there's like maybe some theory that needs to be done on like cross species     
1:23:29     
behaviors I mean I know we have evolutionary theory but it's hard to kind of figure out you know I mean a lot     
1:23:36     
of times uh neuroscientists and cognitive scientists don't really talk about in terms of common ancestry and     
1:23:42     
you know they talk about in terms of just difference and it's kind of a little bit hard to gain any insights out     
1:23:49     
of them but anyways uh paper goes through their model they they use of course classic     
1:23:56     
Pac-Man game as a probe and they develop this framework the language of problem solving model lops model um so the     
1:24:04     
Pac-Man task of course uh is uh where you have this video game Pac-Man in this     
1:24:11     
game players guide Pac-Man and amazed to eat pellets while avoiding and at times hunting ghosts two ghosts are programmed     
1:24:18     
into the game so this is just the two ghost version uh if caught by a ghost players     
1:24:24     
re a timeout penalty after all characters are reset to their starting locations so they've modified The     
1:24:30     
Original Pac-Man game to make this sort of almost like a reinforcement learning     
1:24:35     
game where you kind of get reinforced rewarded for good behaviors and     
1:24:40     
penalized for bad behaviors so this is you know very much uh behavior is kind     
1:24:46     
of Paradigm so you if you want to make this sort of a way to sort of like     
1:24:52     
elicit some of these problem solving behaviors that's probably they're trying to maximize it for     
1:24:59     
that um so we tested humans and monkeys the comparable game settings of one     
1:25:04     
notable difference the monkeys received realtime juice rewards corresponding to their in-game points while the humans     
1:25:11     
were shown a realtime cumulative point of the current game tally on their screens so this is the point I was     
1:25:17     
making before like noticing like the reward in terms of points so monkeys     
1:25:22     
don't really understand the concept of points but they do understand juice rewards so if they get more juice it's     
1:25:29     
basically a higher score so they're kind of normalizing that hopefully that helps     
1:25:36     
get a get a similar result it sort of normalizes the result uh they collected behavioral data     
1:25:43     
from 34 humans and two monkeys so I guess it's harder to work with monkeys and getting human subjects     
1:25:51     
on this but yeah um so this is a diagram here this is of course our figure one as we just mentioned this is the sort of     
1:25:58     
summary of what you're doing so uh we have the initial state where they start playing the language of problem solving     
1:26:05     
so this shows that you have this grammar which of course are these grams so it's     
1:26:10     
an engram model of grammar so you have the byrams trigrams and unigrams you     
1:26:16     
have uh you know these strategies where you have two two things three things and     
1:26:22     
one thing grouped together uh you know G GL l o would be the Byram Sten and AP     
1:26:30     
being the trigram and EV being the unigram and I guess that relates to different strategies for solving the you     
1:26:37     
know for navigating this and solving the problem of avoiding the ghosts eating a     
1:26:43     
power pellet hunting the ghost so that's that's what they're goinging and then the actions are sort of mapped from the     
1:26:50     
strategies so the strategies here mapped to these different actions which are moving in different directions     
1:26:57     
so you can see here that the trigram for example results in these three strategies it's just three strategies     
1:27:03     
bundled together it's an engram model and then the actions are these six     
1:27:09     
different possible actions that result from these strategies okay so they've kind of this     
1:27:16     
is how they're driving this grammar from these strategies from this kind of task     
1:27:22     
just so we're clear because it doesn't isn't immediately obvious how you would apply the you know the Pac-Man game with     
1:27:30     
brand and then this is our uh Marco maravian model or a non-markovian model     
1:27:36     
and so you can see that you have Upstream you have these states S1 S2 S3     
1:27:43     
S4 S5 and S6 and there's a transition from each of those forward so this is     
1:27:48     
the flow of time forward you have these different strategies or different words     
1:27:54     
so you have the Byram the unigram and the trigram these are the correspond to the grammar you have these different     
1:28:00     
strategies which are the the words the the two or the chunks and then you have     
1:28:08     
this sort of transition Matrix where you can go from uh State S1 to these to this     
1:28:16     
word GL and then to this word L we're going from word GL back to State 2 S2     
1:28:22     
you can go from State One one to state two directly if you if this Bagram isn't     
1:28:28     
applicable to the strategy that's being used there's just a transition from S1 to     
1:28:33     
S2 and you can do that for any one of the states going from S1 to S2 S2 to S3     
1:28:38     
and so forth or you can transition into these strategies and you can only maybe     
1:28:44     
use one strategy in the Byram and t two or use both of them and move to     
1:28:51     
S3 so it's it's interesting how you know these These grammars are sort of you     
1:28:58     
know you can use parts of the of the Byram or trigram and you know but but they're     
1:29:05     
grouped in this way so this is the grammar is these are the words and then this is the marvian model so it's a     
1:29:11     
non-markovian model in the sense that it doesn't operate by the pure State     
1:29:17     
transitions you interact with these grammar in different ways     
1:29:24     
um so yeah so the strategy abbreviations are L local GL Global EV evade s stay AP     
1:29:34     
approach Energizer which is eating the pellet so this is kind of how they Define these strategies and then these     
1:29:41     
are grouped in for so uh to play the game the subjects     
1:29:48     
need to create a solution by piecing together a sequence of actions to clear the maze okay that's basically the     
1:29:54     
global State or the goal and so in achieving that goal they go through this lops model and they make this non-     
1:30:01     
Marian uh path through it um and then so achieve to achieve this goal we first     
1:30:07     
need to determine at which level we should build the language model although the Pac-Man game is solved by a sequence     
1:30:12     
of actions which are these arrows uh the basic components of the lops model uh     
1:30:18     
shall be at a higher level of abstraction which means that you don't abstract it at the Raw sequence of     
1:30:24     
actions you abstracted at um these other types of actions that were described in     
1:30:31     
the um set of words so as motor actions depend too much on many details of game     
1:30:37     
states such as maze types and Pacman's exact location cognitively similar     
1:30:43     
Solutions can be associated with a large variety of action sequences which prevents us from understanding the     
1:30:49     
compositional principles of the clear's problem Sol so this is where you can't just use output motor actions directly     
1:30:57     
you have to kind of think about how those motor actions kind of fit together you know strung together and so uh this     
1:31:04     
is but this is also a problem because you know you get this uh really you     
1:31:10     
can't understand the compositional principles you only understand the motor outputs and their sequences so they had     
1:31:18     
some previous work in 19 we'll go down to that in a bit but this provides a     
1:31:23     
better alternative in that study we have demonstrated a set of heris strategies that can account for     
1:31:28     
the monkey's behavior in the Pac-Man game each strategy focuses on a subset     
1:31:34     
of the game elements and a subg goal so they're solving for a sub goal and then they put those sub goals together and     
1:31:42     
dictates the joystick action selection accordingly so for example the local strategy which is lo a player only     
1:31:49     
considers the reward within a ten tile radius and moves the joystick to guide Pacman in the direction that offers the     
1:31:55     
largest reward so it's a local maximization of reward while the evade     
1:32:01     
strategy directs Pac-Man away from the nearest Coast which is more of I guess a     
1:32:06     
global evade just you know there's no counting it's just wherever the nearest     
1:32:12     
ghost is let's get away from importantly we showed that the monkey gameplay could be described as sequences of dominating     
1:32:19     
strategies so this is suggests that there's some game theoretic as ECT to this too that you could implement but     
1:32:26     
that's beyond what we're doing here uh and so human game playay can be     
1:32:32     
similarly described as sequences of dominating strategies in addition we identify two additional strategies stay     
1:32:40     
keeping Pacman near a specific location and save keeping Pacman away from the     
1:32:46     
Energizer and so this is where you know you can actually Implement different     
1:32:51     
techniques to to hunt ghost morph efficiently or take advantage of scarce     
1:32:59     
resources so the core of the WPS framework is this language model Tri upendram so upend which is     
1:33:07     
UPN which is based on the engram language model like in a typical engram     
1:33:12     
model the probability of adopting a strategy uh depends on its preceding n minus one strategies in a unigram model     
1:33:20     
or where there's a single word or strategy each strategy is history     
1:33:26     
independent so this is where we don't care about the history in unigram and     
1:33:31     
this would be like Curly Marian I guess with a Byram model where n equals 2     
1:33:37     
which has two rules in it strategies are Marian okay dependent on only the     
1:33:43     
immediately preceding strategy so when you transition from State one to state     
1:33:48     
two State one to state two transition depends on your being in state one so     
1:33:53     
that's also Marian um and then uh more complex NRS     
1:33:59     
where n is greater than two strategies are no longer Marian so for the trigram     
1:34:05     
strategies are now no longer movian they're exhibited depend they exhibit dependencies through on multiple     
1:34:12     
proceeding strategies so when you go through your uh State machine you know you have S1 to S2 S2 to S3 S3 to S4 what     
1:34:22     
happened in S1 is relevant to what's going to H you know the probability of reaching us for and so this is where you     
1:34:30     
know we have this non marvian model where we don't we're not reliant on the     
1:34:36     
immediately previous state we're not history independent we actually have to     
1:34:42     
work you know it's history dependent it's path dependent basically we also consider a variant the     
1:34:49     
skip gram which strategies can dependent non-consecutive seeding strategies     
1:34:54     
skipping one or more in between long inrs and Skip grams provide     
1:35:00     
more flexible and efficient decision making and demand more cognitive capacity so yeah this is basically the     
1:35:07     
model that they're using um this shows uh the lops grammars uh this is the     
1:35:13     
ratio of engrams byrams and unigrams so the engrams are larger than two which     
1:35:19     
are the trigrams the byrams are the uh two uh strategies and then the unigram     
1:35:25     
is the B strategy so you actually have this interesting thing here where you have     
1:35:32     
expertise and amateur so you have this expert uh sort of behavior you have the     
1:35:38     
amateur sort of behavior so you have experts clustering up here using more byrams and     
1:35:44     
engrams um and then you know I guess kind of unigrams as well it's hard to see kind of how these distribute in this     
1:35:51     
three-dimensional space um you have experts and amateurs clustering out you know in     
1:35:58     
different groups you have uh I guess monkey o is     
1:36:04     
here um and yeah it's kind of hard to see what they're getting at with this     
1:36:10     
graph this kind of an example of one that could be done a little bit better but this is the engram usage ratio up     
1:36:17     
here each subject's uh unigram Byram and complex engram usage ratios plotted in     
1:36:23     
three Space by applying the agamer of clustering method to Andrus ratios we do     
1:36:29     
Identify two distinct clusters among the human subjects experts and novices the monkeys are indicated by the     
1:36:37     
yellow which is monkey o which is here and the purple dot monkey P I think     
1:36:43     
the purple dot is here so they're both it's overlapping with the yellow so     
1:36:48     
they're both the monkeys are both in this amateur category and they match sort of the     
1:36:55     
human amateurs but they don't match the human experts so I guess the uh the     
1:37:01     
takeaway here is that the monkeys don't Master it like the humans     
1:37:08     
do and they use you know less complex um parameters so the high     
1:37:15     
unigram usage and a moderate Byram usage and a low endr usage I guess that's the     
1:37:22     
lesson to take away from this you also see this here in D where you     
1:37:27     
have the experts the dist distribution of complexity with the experts and those     
1:37:33     
are all humans you have the novices in this distribution uh with a lower mean     
1:37:38     
lops complexity and then the monkey o and monkey P examples which are really     
1:37:44     
kind of with lops lops complexity very similar to the human novices and the     
1:37:49     
human Experts of course are overlapping but um the human experts can exceed the     
1:37:55     
monkeys can exceed so let me go down to 17 here of     
1:38:00     
this resource this reference oh this is okay this is the     
1:38:05     
state space so this shows kind of the strategies and how they transition between strategies this shows the expert     
1:38:13     
human where they have many more strategies and you know there different     
1:38:19     
transitions between them uh the novice human which has fewer strategies and     
1:38:24     
their fewer transitions between them they're you know kind of uh maybe alternating between a few     
1:38:31     
strategies more commonly than others and then the monkey reflects the novice     
1:38:37     
human where they kind of transition between only a small number of     
1:38:43     
strategies and you know so basically the monkey performance matches the no human     
1:38:50     
performance     
1:38:56     
all right let's go down to the references so reference 17 is this paper     
1:39:04     
by year in 2021 and that's geometry of abstract form knowledge in the     
1:39:10     
hippocampus it's a nature paper so this is interesting that they're bringing up     
1:39:16     
um spatial learning in hippocampus in this and especially the     
1:39:22     
geometry V abstract knowledge so I guess in Pac-Man we're using similar things to     
1:39:27     
spatial cognition and kind of understanding geometry of abstract spaces so that's     
1:39:36     
really interesting     
1:39:43     
okay so our second paper is on non-markovian social contagion in simpal     
1:39:49     
complexes so this is where this is in communication physics this is another     
1:39:55     
group of authors guess they're from China um yeah and so they talk about     
1:40:03     
these Nar morovian social contagion so they're talking about networks now and they're talking about how you can have     
1:40:10     
social contagion in these simplical complexes whichever where you have     
1:40:15     
shapes that you know you have network connectivity that form simple shapes so you can have triangles and diamonds and     
1:40:22     
other types of complexes that form you know distinct uh     
1:40:27     
sort of topologies and then you know that's that's sort of the sort of these     
1:40:34     
sub networks that you can actually characterize and so this is a where we're emerging topological data analysis     
1:40:41     
with network Theory so that's what they're getting at then they have these non-m Marian social contagion which     
1:40:47     
they'll describe so the abstract reads higher order structures such as simplical     
1:40:53     
complexes are ubiquitous in numerous R World networks uh empirical evidence     
1:40:58     
reveals that interactions among nodes occur not only through edges which are the connections between nodes but also     
1:41:05     
through higher dimensional simplical structur such as triangles so you have two nodes that are connected through an     
1:41:12     
edge but of course you can have three nodes that are connected by three edges those form triangles and those are     
1:41:18     
higher dimensional structures that we can look at so in a network where often interested in these pairwise     
1:41:25     
relationships between two nodes as sort of the base uh Baseline for building the     
1:41:32     
network you know we usually have this JJ relationship between the E node and the     
1:41:38     
jth node in simplical structures we're interested in triangles where we have     
1:41:44     
the e j and kith node then we connect those in different ways and we can     
1:41:49     
actually look at those structures as an individual unit nevertheless classic models such as     
1:41:56     
the threshold model fail to capture group interactions with these higher order     
1:42:02     
structures so when we build a threshold model of edges and we say that all edges over a certain strength are included in     
1:42:08     
our Network those you know we can use those to sort of understand our     
1:42:14     
Network and you know distinguishing between signal and noise because there's a lot of noise in these     
1:42:20     
interactions um now in the classical model what fails to capture group interactions in these higher order     
1:42:26     
structures in this paper we propose a higher order non-markovian social contagion model considering both higher     
1:42:33     
order interactions and the non-markovian characteristics of re World spreading     
1:42:39     
processes so we're looking at these higher order structures we're also looking at how real world spreading     
1:42:46     
processes which is where something spreads from node to node and of course when you have those pairwise     
1:42:52     
interactions we can just simply say that that when something spreads from node to node that it relies on its immediately     
1:42:59     
previous state so that's marvian like we talked about with the strategies so when     
1:43:04     
we go from the e node to the J node we have this immediate relationship between     
1:43:10     
two states and that's of course Marian but then when we have multiple U nodes     
1:43:17     
that have multiple edges and we consider a spreading uh process that's spreads     
1:43:23     
from node to node to node to node and we characterize that with one of these simplical complexes say like a triang or     
1:43:30     
a diamond or a triangle or something even larger and more complex then we     
1:43:35     
have this non-markovian model which of course is where you know we have to look     
1:43:41     
at the path dependence of this spreading process we develop a mean field Theory     
1:43:47     
to describe its evolutionary Dynamics simulation results reveal that the     
1:43:52     
theory is capable of predicting the steady state of the model our theoretical analysis indicate that     
1:43:58     
there's an equivalence between the higher order non-markovian and the higher Marian social contingents so     
1:44:05     
there's an equivalence between these two processes even if it's non     
1:44:10     
Marian and which is probably good for predictive abilities because you know we want to break down this process into its     
1:44:18     
parts we want to also look at par wise relationships if we're interested in like looking at very specific events in     
1:44:27     
this in this path dependence so that's good besides we find that non-markovian     
1:44:32     
recovery can boost the system resilience to withstand a large scale infection or     
1:44:37     
a small scale infection on different conditions so you can look at different you know degrees of infection different     
1:44:44     
scales of spreading and you know it's consistent across those uh this work     
1:44:51     
deepens our understanding of the behavior of high order nonari and social contagion in the real     
1:44:58     
world so I mean this is a pretty hard you know if you're not used to like how     
1:45:04     
people think about networks and how people think about spreading on networks or contagion it's maybe a little bit     
1:45:10     
hard to wrap your head around but they talk a little bit about     
1:45:15     
this um in the paper where they talk about these simplies uh where you have     
1:45:22     
nodes and edges that form triangles or some sort of tetrahedron in the real world many     
1:45:28     
systems can be effectively represented as complex networks consisting of nodes and     
1:45:34     
edges um so you know these simplical complexes are frequently observed in     
1:45:40     
these in these networks as sort of the substructure of the network for example     
1:45:45     
a feed forward Loop is significant Network structure the transcriptional regulation networks that exist that     
1:45:51     
people have extracted from gene expression data so these feed forward Loops are you know very common motifs     
1:45:58     
what they call motifs and you know motifs are basically these substructures     
1:46:04     
but they don't really form anything that's we understand as like a as a     
1:46:09     
shape and so you know there's this connection between these like substructures and these uh you know     
1:46:17     
shapes that we can like derive from Network topology so we have Fe forward     
1:46:23     
Loops we have also closely connected structures such as triangles uh which are commonly found in     
1:46:30     
networks of scientific cooperation and social communication simplical complexes can     
1:46:36     
also be identified in diverse domains including brain networks email networks     
1:46:42     
and human contact networks so we've talked about this before where you can use complex networks to model a wide     
1:46:48     
variety of systems and it assumes this sort of universality so the universality     
1:46:54     
then of course allows us to take these structures that we see in the network     
1:46:59     
topology and identify them all across different systems like in the brain or     
1:47:04     
in you know technological networks soot technical networks and social networks     
1:47:10     
or pure social networks um and then of course spreading Dynamics is a very important um you know     
1:47:19     
thing to understand for both social contagion and for dis diseases um but however empirical     
1:47:26     
evidence reveals that pawise interactions between nodes and not capture group interactions in real     
1:47:32     
networks so we can't just use pairwise interactions to understand these Network     
1:47:38     
relationships we can't really understand the simple parts of that we have to     
1:47:43     
understand you know uh this this phenomena through these sort of simplical complex     
1:47:50     
complexes um so Network scientists have increasingly focused on the impact of these higher order interactions which is     
1:47:57     
what you know they're doing here for example the higher order interactions of two simplies can lead to     
1:48:03     
a phase transition from continuous to discontinuous social     
1:48:08     
contagion so you know if we think about these pairwise relationships between e and J node we can just piece them     
1:48:16     
together compositionally and say okay something spreads from E to J node and     
1:48:21     
then from J node to kith node and then so on and so forth and we can see this very continuous spreading on     
1:48:29     
the other hand you know if we look at this in terms of two simplies we don't     
1:48:34     
get that same type of regularity we get these sort of uh things that have this     
1:48:41     
uh contingency and can indeed be discontinuous in time so things can hang around in that     
1:48:49     
simplex and then you know uh spread to another sulex and so     
1:48:55     
forth in competitive spreading processes involving two types of epidemics which we can model as sort of a you know a a     
1:49:04     
multi-compartment model where we have a single Network and we have two sources two nodes that are the sources of     
1:49:10     
different epidemics and then they spread competitively across the network recruiting nodes is they you know as     
1:49:17     
they spread an increase in the infection probability within higher order structures can result in alternating     
1:49:24     
dominance between the two epidemic types so this talks you know this is really     
1:49:29     
kind of in reference to evolutionary Dynamics which I won't get into here but that's relevant to this problem and so     
1:49:36     
it's like when you have two things that are competing in a space they sort of compete for resources and they fluctuate     
1:49:43     
in terms of their dominance and this is actually what we saw in the other paper where they talked about dominant     
1:49:48     
strategies so it's interesting how those two things are related furthermore in temporal higher order     
1:49:54     
networks the temporal properties of the underlying Network structure contain the     
1:49:59     
impact of higher order epidemic spreading so this is where we have to look at the temporal properties of the     
1:50:05     
network structure and how that can strains the impact of spreading in multi-layer networks for example     
1:50:13     
resource layers or social layers with two Simplex structures and effectively     
1:50:18     
suppress epidemic spreading and outbreaks so this is where we if we take our problem and we divide it up into two     
1:50:26     
parallel networks that form two layers we have a resource layer and a social     
1:50:31     
layer we can actually and then divide that up into our simplies we can     
1:50:36     
effectively model how epidemics get suppressed how they can spread or how     
1:50:43     
you can get outbreaks so as you know from covid we can have you know not     
1:50:48     
everything becomes an epidemic sometimes you have diseases or viruses that are     
1:50:54     
constrained in their spatial uh distribution or in their social     
1:50:59     
distribution and sometimes they break out and they spread into an epidemic or     
1:51:05     
sometimes you get things that get suppressed um and then occasionally     
1:51:11     
you'll have outbreaks which then die out and you know get suppressed again so you     
1:51:17     
have these complex T temporal dynamics that are interesting and something we can model with network but we have to     
1:51:23     
know kind of how to model it in using these simplies finally the coupling between     
1:51:29     
signals to find the nodes and edges result in explosive topological synchronization so this is where we have     
1:51:36     
these explosive processes such as rapid expansion outbreaks and     
1:51:43     
suppression which is I guess the inverse of explosive but the point is is that you have these nonlinear     
1:51:50     
Dynamics in classic spreading damic models such as epidemic spreading models the infection or recovery process is     
1:51:57     
typically assumed to be a Marian process in other words an infection event occurs     
1:52:02     
at constant rate so we have this rate parameter that we have to worry about leading to an in of event time that     
1:52:09     
follows an exponential distribution so this is where we have like our strategies where you transition from     
1:52:16     
state to state um we assume that the the infection and Recovery processes Marian     
1:52:24     
so when we go from I to ja node from J node to KI node that's a maravian process it's basically linear and it     
1:52:32     
occurs at a constant rate so the transition from state to state is is a constant rate and we don't like vary     
1:52:40     
that rate very much in terms of time um but then we also have this inter event     
1:52:45     
time that follows an exponential distribution um so this means that you know we have this these uh sort     
1:52:52     
differential dynamics that are interesting we also have studies that have shown that many real world     
1:52:57     
processes are non- marobi and their inner event times do not follow an exponential distribution so the interner     
1:53:04     
event times vary in non-markovian versus marvian processes uh and we can look at that     
1:53:12     
statistically um the empirical evidence indicates that intervent time in infection or recovery     
1:53:18     
events and epidemic spreading processes do not follow an exponential distribution but a curve distribution     
1:53:26     
with obvious Peaks and that that response is this nonlinear aspect that     
1:53:31     
you get from the non-markovian uh thing so in other words individuals become infected or recovered     
1:53:39     
within a concentrated period of time in Innovation diffusion processes which is     
1:53:44     
a different set of spreading uh phenomena basically where some Innovation spreads across the network so     
1:53:51     
if you think about like tool use in monkeys or you think about like computer     
1:53:56     
use in humans that Innovation spreads Across The Social Network people buy     
1:54:01     
computers they start making learning how to make tools etc etc um there's this     
1:54:07     
diffusion process of those innovations that mimics the sort of spreading of uh     
1:54:13     
diseases or this um EP um um this     
1:54:19     
epidemiological model so in Innovation diffusion processes the inner event time     
1:54:25     
for adopting a new product follows a bell-shaped curve distribution which is a non-markovian process significance of     
1:54:33     
non-markovian processes is burn of increasing attention including efforts to comprehend their impact and epidemic     
1:54:40     
spreading thresholds investigating equivalences between non-markovian and markovian epidemic spreading processes     
1:54:47     
examine how non-markovian recovery processes include influence failure propagation     
1:54:53     
and uncover the conditions under which Marian and non-markovian models are transient state equival so there are a     
1:54:59     
whole bunch of things here and a whole bunch of references from 47 to 4 to 52 to 53 to 54 and 56 to 57     
1:55:11     
and 58 so from 47 to 58 there's references and we'll check those out in a little     
1:55:18     
bit right now you know this is kind of their image of this illustration of theory related     
1:55:25     
Concepts so you have the zero Simplex which is a single node a one Simplex     
1:55:31     
which is a connection between two nodes a two Simplex which is a triangle a three Simplex which is this diamond and     
1:55:40     
then the simplical complex which is like a combination of these different simplexes so in this one we have a zero     
1:55:48     
Simplex connected by a one Simplex to a two simplex     
1:55:53     
connected to a three Simplex another one Simplex connecting another three Simplex     
1:55:59     
so you have these simple complexes that you can put together as sort of a sub     
1:56:04     
Network they consist of these different simplexes and then you can look at you     
1:56:09     
know how things are you know s of spread within the simplical complex Within     
1:56:15     
These simplexes themselves and so that results in something that you know for     
1:56:20     
default is the one simplex or the E and Ja case then we have uh you know more     
1:56:26     
interesting Dynamics in these higher order simplexes but also in the simple     
1:56:32     
complex this shows the one Simplex infection so going from one no to another that's a p Marian process the     
1:56:39     
two Simplex which is this non-markovian process and then recovery which is a     
1:56:45     
Marian process or feedback on the one Simplex case we have these virtual noes     
1:56:53     
and these are kind of like hypothetical scenarios and that's that's kind of why     
1:56:58     
we have these dotted lines in here but uh basically it just shows kind of these     
1:57:04     
different uh representations um you know again you     
1:57:10     
have in C you have this non marov and infection recovery process in simple     
1:57:18     
complexes and just showing that um     
1:57:26     
yeah so that it just shows a bunch of theoretical results here um you know how these different simp uh simplical     
1:57:33     
degrees performed and this has an effect on the steady state infection density so     
1:57:38     
they're able to derive a mean field Theory here where you know they can kind of get a sense of what the mean behavior     
1:57:45     
is of this system for these different uh simplical complexes so it doesn't describe every case but the theory is     
1:57:51     
basically one that just describes the mean     
1:57:56     
case and then so finally we get to the references so I mentioned that we have a     
1:58:01     
bunch of references here that are related to non- Marian uh behaviors uh     
1:58:08     
so I think it was 47 through 58 so you have um the 58 is validity of marov and     
1:58:16     
modeling for transient memory dependent epidemic Dynamics uh 57 is non morovian recovery     
1:58:23     
makes complex networks more resilient against large scale failures so again you know we have these aspects of     
1:58:30     
robustness and uh you know thinking about how memory dependent the structure     
1:58:36     
is uh non-markovian epidemic spreading on temporal networks this is uh just     
1:58:42     
basically more about like how you get these temporal networks and these uh     
1:58:47     
spreading events that are not Marian 55 is equivalent and it's     
1:58:52     
invalidation between non Marian and Marian spreading Dynamics on complex     
1:58:57     
networks so this just shows you that they're not equivalent 54 is equivalence     
1:59:03     
between non-markovian and maravian Dynamics and epidemic spreading so this     
1:59:08     
is about like I guess this is these are two kind of papers that go together uh 53 is non-markovian     
1:59:15     
infection spreads dramatically or spread dramatically Alters the susceptible infection susceptible epidemic thrust     
1:59:23     
networks so again you know when you have these thresholds you know you have the E     
1:59:28     
and J connection if it's a weak connection we don't count it so in the     
1:59:34     
real world that would mean that if e individual and J individual interacting     
1:59:39     
they don't spread whatever it is that's the contagion if the threshold is higher     
1:59:46     
if the sort of the virulence of the thing is higher than I connection or I     
1:59:51     
will spread to J node so that's that's how you know you can think about these thresholds and then that works across     
1:59:57     
the network so each Edge has a certain threshold and that kind of model is sort of what they're arguing is that that's     
2:00:05     
um not sufficient to explain some of these Dynamics uh 52 is meanfield models for     
2:00:12     
narn marvian epidemics and networks so people have worked on these meanfield models     
2:00:17     
before uh generalization of pawise models the non marov and epidemic on networks so again taking the pawise     
2:00:24     
model of networks and and making it this non-markovian aspect and I guess the     
2:00:29     
innovation of this paper is that they're using simplical complexes so people have looked at this non-markovian spreading     
2:00:36     
before but this is kind of introducing this top logical aspect uh 50 is analytically solvable     
2:00:43     
model of spreading Dynamics with non panian processes so non panian processes     
2:00:50     
are of course related to non maravian processes um in in a number of ways so     
2:00:56     
that's not going to get into that now but that's an interesting paper um to understand more about this     
2:01:04     
uh 49 is impact of human activity patterns on the Dynamics of information diffusion so this again is having to do     
2:01:11     
with these spreading networks and information diffusion instead of epidemiology is paper 48 impact of non     
2:01:20     
panian activity p patterns on spreading processes again this is the spreading process and thinking about this in terms     
2:01:28     
of Pan versus nonan activity and panian is in reference to like the pan     
2:01:34     
distribution or pan process which is where you know you have this thing that     
2:01:39     
occurs these different events that occur over time and they tend not to be normally distributed they tend to be     
2:01:46     
clustered uh in aant according to a pant process which there's an equation for     
2:01:51     
and you can derive a distribution and um you know we won't get into what that     
2:01:57     
looks like but that's suffice it to say it's different than sort of a uh random     
2:02:02     
or stochastic purely stochastic process and then 47 of course is it's     
2:02:09     
using wble distribution for modeling bodal diffusion curves and this is on     
2:02:14     
the product life cycle so this is having to do with technology uh the evolution of technology and the spreading of     
2:02:21     
Technology and thinking about how things diffuse and of course you can model     
2:02:26     
diffusion as a bodal distribution or bodal process so there's a lot of stuff     
2:02:32     
here that's connected between you know uh intelligence cognitive ability     
2:02:39     
epidemics and network Theory and then these different types of Marian and non-markovian     
2:02:48     
processes yeah really interesting the I mean I've mentioned this before     
2:02:55     
but you know the the     
2:03:00     
advanced um electromagnetic neur Imaging which is     
2:03:06     
the dynamic causal modeling you know so then you're putting this particular     
2:03:11     
Jansen writ you know three cell type model in each node right yeah and and     
2:03:21     
then you're you're you know potentially trying to explain the differences between two     
2:03:30     
EEG conditions right or to EEG you know populations you got you know same same     
2:03:37     
task different populations or different tasks same     
2:03:43     
population but just how how yeah how important the computational     
2:03:49     
modeling is to understand that that Dynamics you know um and sort     
2:03:56     
of yeah what what's possible what's not you know this is this is where um this     
2:04:03     
kind of conversational work just is is absolutely necessary you know um and um     
2:04:11     
yeah yeah um and interesting how yeah     
2:04:16     
just like the the addition of noes isn't necessarily you know linear or intuitive     
2:04:23     
right yeah uh and then when you think about brain     
2:04:29     
connectivity you know that you you you're almost certainly dealing with simplical     
2:04:36     
complexes know yeah what's interesting is that this     
2:04:43     
there's this work being done by Pocky in Evo on building like these neural     
2:04:50     
developmental programs you're uh synthesizing networks and different network topologies and like one of the     
2:04:57     
things we pointed out I think two weeks ago is that they in their package they assume that there's a small world     
2:05:03     
Network being built which means that you have these nodes that are highly connected they join a lot of parts of     
2:05:09     
the network and there's a short path length between different ends of the     
2:05:15     
network so that's just an assumption they make now you know we don't know if that's how Network should be connected     
2:05:22     
certainly connectomes like seigan connectome is revealed the small world architecture but you could easily     
2:05:29     
connect these networks in different ways and get different results sure so sure     
2:05:34     
sure yeah yeah and you sometimes we're making those assumptions so that we can     
2:05:41     
actually compute some solutions but you know we know we know     
2:05:48     
that those assumptions are going in right yeah um no that's that's really interesting now     
2:05:56     
is she doing that off the basis I mean when you say synthesizing networks is that just     
2:06:04     
uh from I mean is that literally just in silico experiments or is that off of     
2:06:11     
some sort of Imaging or um cell Sate data or something like that well I think     
2:06:19     
it in her well I think what she's Maybe starting out with is like synthesizing it in silicone just kind of okay I mean     
2:06:25     
just just just pure simulation yeah and then I think like you could put in like you could have as anut like actual data     
2:06:34     
from uh the embryo in this case it would just be synthesizing networks of cells not not neurons or or an emerging     
2:06:41     
connect but we we also in uh several years ago we did you know of course the     
2:06:47     
work with developmental breaken vehicles and we have this you know platform um     
2:06:53     
where you know we we actually have these growing networks in of connecton in the     
2:06:59     
Bri Vehicles so we can like Define a network in terms of its size we can     
2:07:06     
simulate it so we can grow the network over different simulation and see the differences between the network     
2:07:12     
topologies so that's in silico in like a brain vehicle where you have different nodes within the network in the neural     
2:07:18     
network inside and it's you know it showing differences in terms of how it's     
2:07:24     
uh behaving and so you know we've been interested in that and and people have done a lot of work on like sort of     
2:07:31     
growing neural networks so growing the size of a neural network and this in case in this case it's just a     
2:07:38     
multi-layered neural network that's you know growing in terms of its node size and its depth and seeing what that looks     
2:07:44     
like and that's interesting one too because it's um it just shows that like there's this difference between networks     
2:07:51     
a different size not only like statically but like what happens when you take the same network train it and     
2:07:58     
then expand its capacity what happens there so that's that's kind of     
2:08:03     
the it's an interesting field yeah oh totally Absol absolutely absolutely I I     
2:08:09     
was it's just making me think about this um uh um project     
2:08:16     
from Ro um looking at inferring and perturbing     
2:08:23     
sufate regulomes in human cerebral organoids and I think they're doing yeah     
2:08:30     
you know so it's definitely it's definitely development but I think it's it's also trying to get at kind of     
2:08:39     
um this would be networks Gene regulatory networks yeah     
2:08:44     
you and um and they I believe have some     
2:08:50     
good dat that they've made available     
2:08:56     
um uh you know interesting interesting thought I     
2:09:03     
wonder if if that would be something I think that would that you     
2:09:09     
know um maybe maybe Lucas would be interested     
2:09:14     
in something like that like like I mean he's he's keeps asking about genomic     
2:09:20     
kind of projects um but it would be nice to keep     
2:09:26     
it yeah yeah uh um I keep you know I     
2:09:32     
keep thinking about psychiatric uh genomic work and then just think ah     
2:09:39     
it's just such a mess yeah like you know what's what's the     
2:09:47     
U what's the analogy that people use like so many so many ships have crashed     
2:09:53     
there or something like that like like didn't they used to say that about     
2:09:59     
a particular scientific fields or like particular uh anyway     
2:10:06     
yeah this this would be this would be very dorm you know or you know related     
2:10:12     
like like it's it's it's organoid it's celf fate you know I mean I like the Sate regulons right you know     
2:10:22     
and um I don't know if he's used any uh if he's done any art work but I mean     
2:10:28     
again another you know if you want to do genomics then like you should have some hard experience right yeah it's hard one     
2:10:36     
yes that that would that wouldn't be bad that wouldn't be bad yeah um yeah so is     
2:10:43     
is this something that shared in brain organized I I might have but you     
2:10:49     
know you know the this is this is the awful thing about not having that slack     
2:10:54     
history um yeah uh I might have shared it like you know two years ago well I     
2:11:00     
remember seeing it like when you mentioned it it was a really cool it was a really great     
2:11:08     
um you know some of the groups that I've met or you know some of the kind of like     
2:11:14     
molecular startup people that I've met here in San Francisco I I've I've     
2:11:22     
push them towards something like that paper in terms of just like here here's     
2:11:28     
here's a molecular paper with you know actual um yeah it's     
2:11:35     
very very related to kind of actionable um     
2:11:42     
um these are these are kind of mechanistic insights that they could be that could be useful for them right yeah     
2:11:49     
yeah like like uh anyway I I'll put it it's easy to find I     
2:11:56     
mean I I just like I already found the the paper I just     
2:12:02     
um not a lot of not a lot of not enough groups use the term regulo oh yeah well     
2:12:09     
yeah people use a lot of buzz wordss but well but but but it's a good one right I mean the especially in terms of um     
2:12:18     
development and you know that we understand you know again like your your     
2:12:25     
your genome is not your destiny right in the sense that like what we need to know     
2:12:30     
is which genes are on when right right right you know and and that um um you     
2:12:40     
know I don't know whether that means that we go full Dennis Noble but but     
2:12:46     
um you know but that that that that kind of     
2:12:51     
yeah the regulation of the genome is is what you know the expression of the     
2:12:56     
genome at any in in time is what we actually um is     
2:13:03     
your is your destiny right right and and that's different um so     
2:13:11     
here's the paper I'll should I drop it in um dvo or or     
2:13:17     
um organoids organoids I think prob maybe dvo as well sure sure sure     
2:13:25     
yeah um sorry there we     
2:13:31     
go yeah there it is all right so there it is yeah I think I've seen this paper     
2:13:38     
maybe it's even independently of the channel oh okay good good yeah so this is just the yeah infering self regulars     
2:13:45     
infering and perturbing Sate regulars in human brain organoids and and they have     
2:13:51     
um so they have um the repository quad quad     
2:14:00     
biolab quantitative developmental biology lab okay is there um here put     
2:14:09     
this is there um is there group I mean that's like the     
2:14:15     
eth group even though a bunch of them seem to be at um     
2:14:21     
at Ro yeah um but I I see I see in this     
2:14:27     
you know so p is the multi-owned JN inference     
2:14:33     
yeah and then um they have you know the     
2:14:38     
nice thing about this paper is that they have you know a data section and a code section     
2:14:46     
right right um you know the DAT data availability code     
2:14:53     
availability yeah this is uh yeah online content yeah yeah so     
2:15:02     
what's this this kind of you know it's like seek RNA     
2:15:08     
or yeah so it looks like the way they Define regul is multiomic but also     
2:15:13     
transcriptional regulation so you have multiomics which is this where you know     
2:15:19     
and the thing I I always amazed by it's like they can always come up with a new omic it's like so you have like the     
2:15:26     
transcript omics you have the uh regul regulome I guess which is the uh just     
2:15:33     
the network and then of course some of the other things like uh uh you know     
2:15:39     
some of the other ohms that are involved in that chrom chromatin accessibility and things like that yeah promic yeah     
2:15:47     
proteic uh yeah yeah and I I assume that their choice of     
2:15:56     
organoids is restricting the genomics that they're actually looking at in the     
2:16:02     
sense that like like by using a particular cell line yeah that they're     
2:16:07     
you know I I'm not familiar with what the gli3 KO organoids like I would to     
2:16:15     
look that up in terms of what that it just might be easier to call     
2:16:20     
culture too I mean you know it's just true no no no absolutely absolutely um     
2:16:27     
and yeah yeah we're we're we're almost getting to the to the point where we can     
2:16:34     
start to um well we're gonna start with some projects uh um with some open     
2:16:40     
source bioreactors oh wow okay yeah yeah and and so at at this point um I think     
2:16:48     
what we're and you know this is it's been a long time coming right um I think     
2:16:53     
at this point we're going to start with um we're going to culture eoli to     
2:17:02     
produce growth factors that we would use for the organiz okay okay so this is     
2:17:09     
this is an old um this was something that we I think was like right before     
2:17:14     
the pandemic um I seem to remember meeting in person I I don't know it's all fuzzy     
2:17:21     
hour um but this was an old idea where it was like maybe we start with a little     
2:17:27     
synthetic bio uh um just to you know again some of     
2:17:32     
this also getting to the point where we can um we're not quite what do they call     
2:17:38     
it bsl2 I mean in terms of BIOS safety like um you know we're we're still using     
2:17:44     
some kind of shared shared facilities lab space and things like that so we     
2:17:50     
need to get our um yeah we we we we're working there we're working there but     
2:17:56     
that that would be you the the next thing would be looking at like whether we would actually start with human cells     
2:18:03     
or would we start with say mouse cells or something like that and and some of that has to do with     
2:18:10     
just um how good do you think you are at this point oh well yeah it's always it's     
2:18:17     
like magic trying to get certain cell types to grow it's yeah yeah yeah yeah and you know I think     
2:18:24     
about that I think about that mine Lancaster talk in terms of just you know     
2:18:30     
reproducibility is a is a big problem in in organoid research yeah in the top     
2:18:37     
Labs you know like you know the labs that have everything have protocols have     
2:18:43     
kind of you know do a lot of of you know knowledge transfer by um um     
2:18:51     
you know in in the kind of not word of mouth but like basically by     
2:18:58     
apprenticeship you know and and so you know how how valuable that is in terms     
2:19:05     
of you know when they when you're talking about these very long manual protocols yeah um anyway um but yeah     
2:19:16     
what what do you did this did you look at this because you thought that would be interesting in terms of this kind of     
2:19:22     
Sate regul I was just interest in the term regul uh and like getting the yeah     
2:19:29     
because we you know we're doing this paper uh that's coming out like probably this next     
2:19:34     
week uh on the uh sort of the theory of differentiation waves and to do that we     
2:19:41     
did a length Lucas and myself did a lengthy data analysis where we combine     
2:19:46     
genomic data proteomic data methylomic data and brought that together to say     
2:19:52     
things about you know certain canidate genes and canidate proteins and and so you know it's it's kind of interesting     
2:19:59     
how to you know combine the data sets that are available so we have all sorts of data sets available from different     
2:20:05     
types of ohms and bringing those together and they of course are doing like primary data collection but you     
2:20:13     
know just thinking about all the things that you need to you know make your argument theoretical argument too to to     
2:20:21     
put all those things together it's yeah so yeah I think that would be good for Lucas maybe to look at this paper     
2:20:28     
see you know and I think I mean yeah and and it's it's I I like it because of     
2:20:36     
course it's organoid and um and it would it's exactly how you would imagine um     
2:20:44     
you know neurod developmental processes um I mean it's it's just the     
2:20:50     
kind of the base on which neurodev developmental processes is are kind of     
2:20:56     
are running mechanistically and you can imagine this is this is what we need to     
2:21:01     
know to understand all the different ways that it could potentially Veer off or you know um um yeah that that would     
2:21:10     
be awesome plus plus I think it's it yeah they're they're again one of these     
2:21:15     
groups that I think is taking is doing organiz research search a little     
2:21:21     
differently than some of the kind of brain science labs I you     
2:21:28     
know be because I think they have a kind of drug function goal yeah that that that yeah     
2:21:36     
it might be driven a little differently let's just say like slightly different goals uh not necessarily better     
2:21:44     
but uh well they have to understand regulation better for that they yeah     
2:21:50     
yeah I I mean yeah it's really their questions are different than some of the     
2:21:55     
the the the disease spec specific disease     
2:22:02     
focused groups uh but um yeah okay well     
2:22:08     
um yeah sorry I wasn't um more more involved today but um but great great     
2:22:15     
papers as usual yeah I've still got to figure out a way to scrape all our     
2:22:21     
um YouTube videos get yeah yeah yeah the the active     
2:22:28     
inference uh Institute has been doing some good work like they've been using AI to do this uh on their videos like I     
2:22:35     
I don't know like the details I should ask more about that and people who are doing this but like there of course     
2:22:42     
YouTube has like they can chapter IE things but like there's a lot that you could do with the videos uh just with     
2:22:49     
like some AI tool I mean people are developing tools all the time now to oh     
2:22:54     
yeah yeah yeah that that would be that would be great to have you know chapters     
2:23:00     
in terms of the papers you cover to to you know like uh yeah yeah yeah well     
2:23:07     
yeah yeah um we could talk to Daniel and at least find out who's who's doing that     
2:23:15     
who just came up on the active inference um     
2:23:20     
oh Josh bungard I I posted that yeah yeah you saw that yeah yeah he did a good talk he had     
2:23:28     
like a you know just like the whole managerie of his embodied agents talking     
2:23:33     
about each one yeah yeah absolutely um um good now there was     
2:23:41     
um I think something else though that um I thought well I'm I'm curious     
2:23:55     
[Music] um I I haven't gone through Patrick minal's talk     
2:24:02     
yeah um that but I would expect that his     
2:24:09     
foundation models for Neuroscience would be would be a good talk yeah     
2:24:14     
yeah uh anyway good deal all right yeah     
2:24:20     
thanks for attending and yeah see you next week take care take care bye

## NOTES
Open-source or how does open-source empower open science?

* projects, livestreams. Julia drone projects, speakers.

* one or two guest speakers (NeuroDesk). Lead developer for SPM (getting money for the EPF). Software sustainability @ Octave, association with the EFF. Figuring out what Octave's limits are.

* Octave initiative to free MATLAB stuff: Guillaume Flandin: https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=S4UNoqAAAAAJ&hl=en

* Neurodesk (Nature paper): Neurodesk: an accessible, flexible and portable data analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging.

* Brian Ripley --> developed R to open up Mathematicians work from S (proprietary).


Open Science (Jesse's interest). 

* running a lab, creating open source. What are the targets we want to hit.

* post about teleology, headed to the Medium.

* ICOR --> advnacing through open research (Incentivising, Collaborative Open Research). Metascience (developed contacts).

* what are people doing in this space? What can you do with data science stuff?

* Dick and Hussain -- lots of progress. Pubs, patents, collaborations. No grants yet.


Sarrah's interest in a manuscript:

* GSoC lightning talk. make a good demo video (published to YT).

* How do we test software (runs, etc)? What kind of things can be incorporated into a paper?

* Calculator task. Examples related to that. Test conditions: high, low, hold things constant.

* make an outline for paper. 


Rosenbluth (1943). Touchstone, reference point. Maxwell's Demons --> reading Kant, Watchmaker (put into ActInf presentation).

* incarnations --> getting into scientific revolutions. What is the actual story? Understanding the space (marge with my notes on teleology).

* discussion in a non-SMN meeting: Agential Materials, Krakauer. Complexity Science takes. Work on takes for complex. 

* Crick and no teleology vs. Systems Biology and re-emergence of the theme.


Fuchs book --> what is he discussing in this space?

* Bergson -- memory paper. Levin -- why do you select for prediction, artificial behavior, cortical labs.

* Journal Club: dish brain --> BrainAware (Indiana) --> TAME Paper.

* Krakauer lecture --> definitions of complexity science.

* Garfield -- collective science podcast. Landscape of 21st century science.


Pattern Formation via Quantum Models.

* connectome-harmonic analysis --> Breaking down resting-state from active states.

* reference for World Modeling paper. Granville's --> black boxes all the way down. Black Boxes.


Connected rigid bodies = low-dimensional space. 

* lower dimensional than you think. 

* William James -- piano playing and neural conduction, detectable gait change (MS, Parkinsons').

* chunking, general mechanisms.


Open Science --> intellectual landscape, complexity-oriented stuff.

* guide people through interdisciplinary work --> how does it fit into the science enterprise?

* Santa Fe does not put open-source tools into the world, but have the public-facing component (draw connections).

* Mark Bedau -- interesting perspectives on data -- how would SFI think about open-source software community (paper on Linux tools).

* Kernel development data, mailing list. Picbreeder --> ML street talk --> open-ended AI.

* nbenko1.github.io --> CPPN paper from 2007. Crowdsourced platform. GalaxyZoo, Picbreeder.

* Wolfram's CA --> when do you see exceptions? Lots of biomimesis.

* not evolutionary -- Isaac Newton institute -- Turing patterns.

I may have to go soon , but, just recalling the Ranulph Granville stuff from before. I may have more fun cybernetics related things ahead about that re a collaborator and their projects

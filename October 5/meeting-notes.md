## NOTES
Open-source or how does open-source empower open science?

* projects, livestreams. Julia drone projects, speakers.

* one or two guest speakers (NeuroDesk). Lead developer for SPM (getting money for the EPF). Software sustainability @ Octave, association with the EFF. Figuring out what Octave's limits are.

* Octave initiative to free MATLAB stuff: Guillaume Flandin: https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=S4UNoqAAAAAJ&hl=en

* Neurodesk (Nature paper): Neurodesk: an accessible, flexible and portable data analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging.

* Brian Ripley --> developed R to open up Mathematicians work from S (proprietary).


Open Science (Jesse's interest). 

* running a lab, creating open source. What are the targets we want to hit.

* post about teleology, headed to the Medium.

* ICOR --> advnacing through open research (Incentivising, Collaborative Open Research). Metascience (developed contacts).

* what are people doing in this space? What can you do with data science stuff?

* Dick and Hussain -- lots of progress. Pubs, patents, collaborations. No grants yet.


Sarrah's interest in a manuscript:

* GSoC lightning talk. make a good demo video (published to YT).

* How do we test software (runs, etc)? What kind of things can be incorporated into a paper?

* Calculator task. Examples related to that. Test conditions: high, low, hold things constant.

* make an outline for paper. 


Rosenbluth (1943). Touchstone, reference point. Maxwell's Demons --> reading Kant, Watchmaker (put into ActInf presentation).

* incarnations --> getting into scientific revolutions. What is the actual story? Understanding the space (marge with my notes on teleology).

* discussion in a non-SMN meeting: Agential Materials, Krakauer. Complexity Science takes. Work on takes for complex. 

* Crick and no teleology vs. Systems Biology and re-emergence of the theme.


Fuchs book --> what is he discussing in this space?

* Bergson -- memory paper. Levin -- why do you select for prediction, artificial behavior, cortical labs.

* Journal Club: dish brain --> BrainAware (Indiana) --> TAME Paper.

* Krakauer lecture --> definitions of complexity science.

* Garfield -- collective science podcast. Landscape of 21st century science.


Pattern Formation via Quantum Models.

* connectome-harmonic analysis --> Breaking down resting-state from active states.

* reference for World Modeling paper. Granville's --> black boxes all the way down. Black Boxes.


Connected rigid bodies = low-dimensional space. 

* lower dimensional than you think. 

* William James -- piano playing and neural conduction, detectable gait change (MS, Parkinsons').

* chunking, general mechanisms.


Open Science --> intellectual landscape, complexity-oriented stuff.

* guide people through interdisciplinary work --> how does it fit into the science enterprise?

* Santa Fe does not put open-source tools into the world, but have the public-facing component (draw connections).

* Mark Bedau -- interesting perspectives on data -- how would SFI think about open-source software community (paper on Linux tools).

* Kernel development data, mailing list. Picbreeder --> ML street talk --> open-ended AI.

* nbenko1.github.io --> CPPN paper from 2007. Crowdsourced platform. GalaxyZoo, Picbreeder.

* Wolfram's CA --> when do you see exceptions? Lots of biomimesis.

* not evolutionary -- Isaac Newton institute -- Turing patterns.

I may have to go soon , but, just recalling the Ranulph Granville stuff from before. I may have more fun cybernetics related things ahead about that re a collaborator and their projects 

## TRANSCRIPT
     
Transcript     
0:03     
hello morning morning morning     
0:10     
morning hi all right uh so welcome to the     
0:16     
meeting uh so yeah we had uh good week uh we had one meeting at     
0:25     
dorm and we talked about two papers in that meeting we talked about a SE aligan     
0:31     
paper on eggling strategies like very     
0:36     
biological variation and eglan and we talked about sort of the difference between eoli information processing and     
0:44     
celegans information processing which you might call a motor circuit and so     
0:50     
that was kind of an interesting uh article as well those are that's on the YouTube channel on the     
0:57     
DOR uh Channel and and it should be the latest     
1:03     
video other than that we didn't do any cybernetics or cognition future meeting     
1:09     
we uh do have some news on the open source frontal but we didn't have a meeting this week     
1:18     
so so a bit of good news for the lab I guess um I submitted two things to the     
1:28     
active inference Workshop the the one upcoming next month and that was accepted or both of     
1:35     
them were accepted as uh an an you know to as content for their workshop so     
1:42     
we're doing this open source session and we're doing you know it's kind of Open Source open     
1:47     
science uh I just kind of put in a a short description but it's already going     
1:53     
to be up to us to find the programming and fill it in and then uh this other     
1:59     
talk on on uh this stuff that we were talking about with the Rosen Booth paper so I     
2:05     
think that's actually uh you know kind     
2:10     
of it'll be interesting I don't know it'll be kind of like a lot of the work we've been doing in     
2:16     
cybernetics and and we'll have to work on that so uh any questions or     
2:28     
comments just you know let me know what um what you think would be     
2:35     
appropriate in terms     
2:41     
of yeah in terms of the kind of the open source     
2:48     
um content yeah content you     
2:54     
know or or would it be more like     
3:00     
you know H how how open source potentially Powers open science or you     
3:08     
know yeah the latter might be interesting because what they're doing in active inference lab is they're doing     
3:14     
a lot of like participatory uh scholarship so they're doing things with you know building     
3:22     
software or some things they have people who want to access different tools like     
3:29     
you know it's like kind of a clearing house for open or for active inference in some     
3:34     
sense uh and so they have like a lot of they they want to do things like get     
3:40     
they have a lot of uh meetings they have a lot of uh live casts that they want to     
3:47     
create artifacts for so like articles and so there's a lot of open science     
3:52     
there's a you know fair amount of Open Source and I don't know like how I I     
3:58     
think open source empowering open science would be a good     
4:04     
um topic or at least like kind of a focus yeah yeah     
4:13     
yeah well as I'm always interested when I see the kind of     
4:21     
um I mean the the projects that they do or you know the kind of the the speakers     
4:28     
they get um are are are     
4:33     
interesting um do do you know if if they've already got some of those those people I mean in     
4:41     
terms of like um you know RX and     
4:46     
fur is kind of a Julia drone     
4:52     
project oh um for instance I don't I     
4:57     
don't know who's speaking or I I think I saw a draft uh I don't know if I well I     
5:04     
paid a lot of attention to all the speakers but um they do have     
5:09     
like yeah I mean would you would you be interested in in speakers or um is it     
5:16     
more putting together a presentation uh well I think we could have like someone     
5:21     
like you know we could have our own sort of informed by our own experiences or     
5:28     
own working grou and then we could have like one or two speakers I'm not really sure how long this is going to be I'll     
5:35     
have to work out those details but it might be good to have one uh if     
5:40     
someone has a good perspective on things the um the guy I was thinking of     
5:47     
um I mean like I said like like nerd desktop guy nerd desk is is guy is     
5:54     
usually up for a a presentation but um with with that kind topic it might be     
6:00     
interesting um the head of uh or the kind of like lead developer for SPM     
6:07     
right so this is the the mat lab package that that Carl friston originally     
6:14     
developed and now has become this kind of much much greater kind of project he     
6:20     
he he's really interesting because he um he's a core developer to     
6:28     
octave so like like as a part of his work at     
6:34     
SPN which has always been a GPL project     
6:40     
um you know like mat Labs kind of hit this point where a lot of people like     
6:47     
either can't afford that lab or kind of don't want to use it on clusters or     
6:53     
things like that right yeah anyway so he started contributing to octave project     
7:01     
um uh at least you know I mean I I talked to him years ago about it uh and     
7:08     
he was quite a significant contributor and and they were octave was actually     
7:14     
getting money from I think the     
7:20     
eff and and that that that eff would     
7:26     
see you it like you know kind of a strange project for for o you know to to     
7:32     
support OCT or you know funny to have the eff support octave yeah but their     
7:37     
their point was that this was this would like making     
7:44     
octave better would free so much other     
7:50     
uh like people had written so much stuff in mat lab oh that that contributing to     
7:56     
octave would would you know kind of free and and make um sustainable all this mat     
8:04     
lab Cod that had been developed um for so long um and you like that that could     
8:12     
be like again like him him speaking about that in terms of just you know as     
8:19     
kind of as it relates to software sustainability and so and and you know     
8:25     
kind of like the the the gck project itself right     
8:31     
right that be     
8:37     
I'll I'll check uh it would be good to get in touch with it it was really nice     
8:43     
yeah he was yeah happy to talk about it yeah that would be a good topic um so     
8:50     
like you know they do open source software there they have their a couple     
8:55     
of research initiatives and having like some sort of of you know like something on that isn't     
9:02     
just kind of like here's what is open source but like a a topic and open     
9:08     
source would be good yeah I mean that that you know that would be kind of     
9:14     
cool you know it's kind of kind of it's kind of like you know talking to what is it Brian Ripley about R you know like     
9:22     
like if R never been developed like a lot of a lot of s and a lot of you know     
9:29     
mathematician's work would have been kind of lost to this Crose Source you     
9:37     
know kind of atrophy of the that     
9:46     
company and then it's like uh mid November when is say yeah ask 13th     
9:54     
through the 16th or yeah 13th through the 16th of November     
10:00     
so yeah I guess we can kind of come up with a little bit more formal uh well I guess at this point you     
10:07     
know it's kind of open I think it's going to be mostly virtual so I think it     
10:12     
might be like asynchronous in some sense so we might just have like a yeah plus plus K like     
10:20     
it because it's it's it's also friston related Frist adjacent well not even adjacent it's     
10:27     
definitely frisen related you know right yeah well first then's on the scientific     
10:33     
Advisory board or at least he was last year yeah yeah for sure for sure obviously but it would be you know so it     
10:40     
would be nice to to talk about their well it's very much gom's effort this isn't this isn't something that he was     
10:47     
made to do you know this is just something where where he he saw he saw great interest he basically uses SPM as     
10:56     
a a great use case for octaves um for figuring out what     
11:03     
like octaves limits are and especially as it relates to um gooey widgets and     
11:10     
and some other so because it's such a it's such an old project that goes back to like     
11:18     
the early 90s because of you know like all these things about it just make it a     
11:24     
great example yeah that's that's uh that's     
11:30     
great um yeah uh well we'll see what we can do     
11:36     
yeah we'll kind of do some programming I don't know Jesse Yeah you got kind of got excited about this too so I don't     
11:45     
know if you had something to say about it [Music]     
11:50     
um not I mean a lot of things have been covered already but more just curious about what     
11:56     
um like do we have a i I I I feel like I'm either     
12:02     
Mis um forgetting or just haven't seen some of the details like how much time for     
12:10     
that like is it like an allotted amount of time we get or like how do that work for like that part of it I know there's     
12:16     
a few things going on like there's like the submission that's the paper whatever but then there's     
12:22     
also this potentially panel potentially whatever like I I guess I was curious     
12:27     
about the details for that we could make programming     
12:33     
for yeah so uh it seems pretty open-ended at this point we have uh for     
12:38     
the for the cybernetics talk it's like anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes and I     
12:43     
think it's up to our discre as to how much time we use so it could be like you know it's something we     
12:50     
pre-record and it's like you know basically I think be closer to 45 and     
12:55     
then the open source stuff I'm not really sure what the what Daniel's     
13:01     
thinking for that but you know it definitely would have like maybe an     
13:06     
introduction we'd want to highlight what we've been doing in our open source interest group how we kind of think     
13:12     
about open source or you know I don't want to get into like what is open source I think a lot of the people doing     
13:19     
attending this are Savvy enough to know that to have like you know like um I think what Morgan was talking about is     
13:26     
kind of good having like an open source for open science and then having like a     
13:31     
guest speaker on a topic that's maybe you know really relevant to active     
13:36     
inference and you know I don't know how much time we have for that but well I think he wants to have this as sort of     
13:43     
like you know Workshop that's uh like I I guess what he wanted and he kind of we     
13:49     
talked about this kind of informally uh sort of an open source uh presence so that people could     
13:57     
get exposed to it I'll have to work out the details later but um if you have     
14:04     
something that you're really interested in and I know you've been interested in open science and and some of that uh we     
14:12     
should talk about it more yeah um like there's there's a     
14:19     
little bit of a duvail into I was he was a a I guess it's official title was the     
14:26     
iore public meeting with SP on advancing open research through meta science this     
14:32     
week iore is the um advancing what is     
14:38     
it uh through open research the uh it's not showing     
14:53     
up incentivizing incentivizing collaborative right yeah yeah     
15:00     
incentivizing is the I word um and that was a fun     
15:05     
um interesting thing to see so I mean it's not it's not uh I it's like I can     
15:12     
just take things from that necessarily but that was exciting in terms of looking at metascience so maybe I'll look more like meta science application     
15:19     
but also like I mean I don't I don't quite know the     
15:26     
um there's things from like almost edic iCal or a mentoring or like how do you run a lab that does this thing or how do     
15:32     
you create open source you know we have a lot of things in the open source sustainability space that that are     
15:40     
applicable so I guess it's just um we can talk more about you know     
15:47     
what what what are the targets that we want to hit I suppose um but yeah that that sounds a     
15:57     
promising yeah just you know this is uh I mean it's     
16:03     
both in the future and almost not you have like a about a good month left or     
16:08     
maybe six weeks to do this so yeah right so it's good well we'll stay     
16:16     
on top of that hopefully I can get more details and we can work on it     
16:24     
more yeah yeah     
16:32     
uh so hello Sara and Hussein don't know if you have any     
16:39     
updates to share with us hi hey hi yeah you     
16:44     
would Okay who wants to go first sure I can go first okay yeah okay     
16:53     
so um yeah I've been working on the uh     
16:58     
breast cancer convenience demography project alongside dick uh we've been making some good progress we just     
17:04     
submitted our manuscript to the Journal of uh we just submitted the BP publication so that's good the best     
17:09     
thing we there okay um yeah we've been moving into     
17:14     
collaboration moving into uh new steps with uh other professionals who are getting on board as well looking for     
17:21     
ways to secure funding like through different programs the ADV grant program andic grant program and um I've been     
17:29     
finding some new tools and software for different sorts of approaches different sorts of approaches and     
17:35     
um yeah that's uh basically it because there's a lot to talk about there's a lot to talk about but um we've been     
17:40     
making some really really good progress ultimately it seems like uh things are the technology once again has a lot of     
17:46     
potential I've already reached out to patent patent firms by the way reached out patent attorneys I don't mean to     
17:51     
jump the gun you know putting the C before the putting the C before the horse because we are not we're not published yet we're not published yet     
17:58     
but um like legally you kind of you kind of need to you kind of need to get on it pretty soon you need to get on pretty     
18:05     
quickly like um in America and Canada there is a okay if something has been     
18:10     
publicly dispos disposed so like you post about something you you publish something you cannot Pat it but there is     
18:17     
a one-year grace period from when something has been disclosed for The Who disclosed it to to find the patent     
18:24     
normally in other countries I don't think they give you so much of a great spirit because the patent technology has to be something like new something novel     
18:30     
so if it's disclosed and people are talking about it then you cannot pattern that so um basically that's where we are     
18:37     
right now yeah still looking through a lot of papers trying to do a lot of work and um you know uh it's it's still just     
18:44     
frustrating that um I'm doing all this without it's all volunt it's all voluntary still but we are applying to     
18:51     
Brands we're reaching out I posted a few um I posted a few in the chat that's good thank you for that update uh it's     
18:58     
sound like you're having a good uh good collaboration SAR are you     
19:05     
there um yeah in terms of updates there isn't like much really like the week     
19:13     
before last uh I put up on the channels that I was doing the G lightning talk     
19:22     
and like a week before I did the talk as well like there were Al I had to prepare     
19:28     
like some SL for it so I also thought it would be a good time to like make a good     
19:33     
demo video of like the entire project so I did that and then Bradly published it     
19:40     
to our YouTube channel so there's like a proper like video of the entire     
19:47     
simulation running so like even during my final presentation there were like a few Kings so those are all cleared out     
19:55     
um but yeah since the G so uh since the talk that I did like I haven't really     
20:01     
been able to do anything much on the project so like uh I started a new     
20:07     
job um so I've been like a lot of time     
20:13     
has definitely been going there uh but it's exciting there as well and even     
20:19     
like uh doing the talk like I when I looked at the code again after like a     
20:24     
break of like two weeks so uh this is like able to get it all done and then     
20:30     
like uh something that I definitely want to you know ask in the coming weeks is     
20:36     
like how do I uh like now that we have the whole simulation running what kind of like     
20:41     
runs do we do to you know uh like when we were talking about a publication I remember Bradley like we have to have     
20:49     
some kind of like statistics of different kinds of runs that we do and     
20:55     
have some kind of data so definitely want to like talk more about how what     
21:02     
kind of things I can do there and uh you know because it'll take some time because the simulations on the thing     
21:08     
take quite a long time to run so that is something I definitely     
21:14     
want some like advice on on like how to proceed in that direction but I haven't     
21:19     
like yet asked for it because the new job was kind of busy in the starting weeks uh so once I like settle in there     
21:26     
I'll definitely uh like come back for advice on that so yeah that's about it from my     
21:33     
side okay that sounds good yeah thank you uh so congratulations on your     
21:39     
lightning talk uh I didn't get to see it but I mean you know hopefully it went     
21:44     
pretty well it was well received yeah sure I even have like a     
21:50     
video of it that someone recorded like like a screen recording so I'll post     
21:56     
that in the res Channel if anybody wants was quite good it was just 3 minutes so     
22:02     
there wasn't like any kind of like indepth or any Q&A or anything but like     
22:08     
I got to present it nicely yeah that's good well yeah and     
22:14     
please post that when you can you know when it's up um and of course I don't know if they     
22:21     
are going to be posting it officially anywhere I do have like a video that was     
22:26     
just like screen recorded okay okay uh but yeah I don't know if there's like a YouTube link or I don't think there is     
22:34     
oh yeah I just have one for person if I can put it up on the G slack channel     
22:39     
would that be like okay or am I not supposed to yeah you can do that     
22:45     
yeah yeah I just that out then all right that would be     
22:50     
great yeah thanks yeah and then uh of course we     
22:55     
have your little demo that we had on the YouTube channel so it's like a minute     
23:01     
long demo kind of walking through the software and yeah so that's on the YouTube     
23:07     
channel and then yeah the the manuscript yeah we should start thinking about that     
23:13     
um you know it's I I don't know exactly how we want to do this I imagine we     
23:18     
could probably just like you know have a uh you know any manuscript you'd have to     
23:25     
have some sort of you know literature review and introduction and then you know the way     
23:31     
you test it out maybe would be to set up a few sample tasks like you were doing     
23:38     
for your gso project you know but maybe make a few more tasks that you know     
23:45     
generate them through auto code Rover and or whatever I can't remember the     
23:50     
actual steps and then run through a couple of     
23:55     
scenarios so you know we you know kind of set up a couple of you know kind of like     
24:02     
this is a task this is a task and we might have like three or four conditions like that and then you run through it     
24:09     
and you show how those tasks are solved and then you know I don't know if we can     
24:14     
well we start we probably start there and then you know maybe like do some more experiments later depending on     
24:21     
what what the results of those are uh we could do benchmarks where you know you test each task so you might have     
24:28     
different types of tasks like you know different in in open source we have different types of issues or different     
24:35     
types of projects where they they involve different types of skill sets different types of     
24:42     
agents and you know we can kind of come up with some uh you know basically experimental     
24:50     
conditions compare them Benchmark them and everything and I think that might be a good     
24:55     
paper um you know it and that's you know that that's something we can I think get     
25:02     
a lot of useful information out of um and you know we can actually and     
25:09     
of course there's the other paper where we have sort of the write up of all the different projects that we have it needs     
25:15     
to be updated so there's a preprint on Research gate right now which has all of     
25:21     
the different models that we've done for open source sustainability we have an active inference model we have some work     
25:29     
done on the reinforcement learning we have a personality model and then now we     
25:35     
have the uh larger language model approach so we put all those kind of in     
25:41     
the list we say you know this is what we have and you know it just needs to be     
25:47     
Rewritten and updated because there's uh the last time it was updated I think was last year so we've done a     
25:55     
lot of work this year and actually I don't even think I properly updated it with respect to how     
26:01     
Manu work uh but but anyways I I'll work on that too uh but yeah if you it would be     
26:08     
helpful SAR is if you could uh put together like an outline of how you     
26:14     
might Envision the you know the how we would test the model how we would Implement     
26:21     
tests of the model so you know if you have ideas specific ideas of things that     
26:26     
you want to look at or test that would be great you know we also I I don't know     
26:32     
how much work you've done on like reviewing like some of the tools involved like you know of course there's     
26:39     
agent based modeling there's also like large language models we did the paper in the meeting on reviewing larger     
26:46     
language models for social simulation there's other there are other papers that are probably relevant there     
26:53     
and kind of walking through those what they've done and then how we kind of     
26:58     
have either taken from that or differentiated ourselves from that and then we get into the models showing the     
27:06     
results and that's and then that's pretty much it we read a conclusion and     
27:12     
that's the paper so I like to make this you know kind of break this down into steps     
27:19     
because a lot of people are pretty overwhelmed by thinking about a whole paper and it's really you know just     
27:26     
thinking about what you want to accomplish there's probably stuff you already have that you can pull into the     
27:33     
paper and and then after that it's just a matter of putting it together and Reporting everything out     
27:40     
so yeah let's let's uh make a kind of a long-term plan for that um but the first     
27:47     
thing we need kind of is an outline of what exactly you want to look at in terms of running the model you know uh     
27:55     
having those condition experimental conditions and you know testing     
28:01     
them so it's yeah it's kind of hard to do you know we have kind of limited computational resources so if we're     
28:08     
working on llms it's going to be a little hard to get good robust tests but     
28:13     
I think just kind of showing some simple examples are are good so don't think you     
28:19     
know that we need to have like this super super high-powered example just     
28:26     
having some you know basically easy to digest problems     
28:32     
because you want to make it easy for people to see the implications of it as well it's not just about like you know     
28:40     
overwhelming people with that I know a lot of papers they try to do that uh where they try to like jam as much data     
28:46     
into the paper as possible but that's not necessarily a great     
28:54     
strategy you have any thoughts about that s right yeah yeah yeah so um so like by     
29:02     
examples you mean like uh so like I took the calculator project as like a a     
29:09     
example task during my G you mean like a few more of those right which would be easy to see and like how it's     
29:16     
progressing during the simulation something like that yeah so yeah the calculator task would be a good example     
29:23     
and then of course having things similar to that so uh you might have like a     
29:29     
simple video game or uh maybe like a     
29:34     
uh app that you know uh I can't think of anything right now     
29:40     
but there are very simple yeah no no I'll definitely yeah I definitely try to like you know sit and think on some like     
29:47     
around three or four like more simple but like still doable and uh like that     
29:54     
can be seen like the progress of which can be seen uh throughout the simulations I rather     
30:00     
to think of like three or four more such examples uh definitely and then like the     
30:05     
test conditions that you talking about so those would be something like whether all the agents start out at like a very     
30:12     
high experience level or low experience level so things like that or like are     
30:17     
you talking about something else in yeah so you want to have like uh if you have different tasks like say you have a     
30:25     
calculator task versus like and you want them to write like a short story and     
30:31     
like you know and I know that's a little bit outside of well it's not really outside of Open Source you could open source a short     
30:37     
story uh you know having like maybe different types of skills applied and     
30:43     
then in the project you would have like you'd set like the calculator at a high     
30:50     
skill level the calculator at a low skill level or you could have a high sk everyone at a high skill level mixed and     
30:58     
everyone at a low skill level and then do that for the short story and you right there you have six conditions you     
31:03     
can test and all it is is just rerunning the code at different settings but     
31:10     
making sure that you have things you can compare so like if you want to compare     
31:15     
High skill level different types of things that they're doing low skill level different types of things that     
31:21     
they're doing and look at how it performs in those in that range of     
31:26     
things the key is sometimes to to have controls so you know you have like you     
31:32     
keep things kind of constant and then you make a a comparison of one thing you     
31:38     
vary one thing which is maybe the task type everything else is held constant you then take those things that are held     
31:46     
constant and you change them all together and you look so you can kind of get a sense of you know if the task type     
31:54     
is the thing that the model is maybe it's it it does well on one task     
32:00     
type it doesn't do well on another task type or it does well when every agent is     
32:06     
uh has a high skill level but not when to have a low skill level things like that so at the end of the day we can     
32:12     
make those kind of uh judgments about it like as you said like the first task is     
32:17     
like trying to make a outline so I'll try to do that once and then like once     
32:23     
I've done that I'll get back to you so like more inside     
32:29     
yeah yeah that's good all right thank you thank     
32:36     
you all right so uh that's good do we have any more updates before we move on     
32:42     
or any other comments uh I could say a few things     
32:47     
okay um depending on what you wanted to say today uh there's     
32:54     
more um I've been w the sort of a I guess a post about     
33:03     
kology um well I'll start before I before that     
33:12     
I'll finish with the other thing um the iore meeting it was interesting um you     
33:18     
know it was it you know for open research and the topic was metascience     
33:23     
and I didn't get to see all of it but I was there and I have now I have a few     
33:29     
contexts at um both iore but also I think that is based in this the     
33:37     
center for open science but but the metascience alliance itself is this     
33:42     
new attempt at um having some kind of a     
33:51     
centralized effort uh because you know like like science     
33:58     
across different fields have their own you particulars and and there's a lot of     
34:04     
you know doing doing open research in one field versus doing operations to another and trying to be inter disciplinary a lot of different     
34:10     
complications to it um and I'm I'm not even I'm I'm fair I I've been in and     
34:16     
around the space but like at an at an actual like bigger level of the center     
34:22     
for open science iore um and other groups like that um um     
34:28     
and and their projects like I'm not really that familiar with them so it was just interesting to see kind of what     
34:34     
people are doing um in that space there's also someone at Virginia I     
34:40     
forget his name that was asked to help out with certain things from like a data science perspective which is really     
34:46     
interesting for me to see like um uh I I can't pull up his stuff and     
34:53     
remember his name but he was used with I think     
34:59     
I think I car like work with him to do some basically data science meta science     
35:04     
work that was interesting to me so I'm actually to look into that more because I've been trying to figure out like okay     
35:11     
how what can I do with quote unquote the data science stuff that I'm learning um     
35:18     
to be very casual and speech about it uh to these ends so I want to look more into     
35:24     
that that space um that's     
35:31     
uh do this first um outside of     
35:38     
that I am we've had a lot of discussions recently on the     
35:46     
um the 1943 paper um and the one on you know purpose     
35:54     
te Behavior andology it's been very interesting Touchstone um     
36:00     
or reference point because in in the last Co futes meeting a week ago had     
36:08     
weal we went through it and then we also um you know there's been a lot of     
36:13     
different context for it like like like Radley's kind of gave a few different wraps on     
36:22     
um uh like why what what were the context sort of the the Prem microbology     
36:29     
context but also we talked about Maxwell's demons and I I actually spent some time this weekend going like     
36:35     
looking into like a much broader Arc of it it's been it's actually made me a lot more interested in Reading     
36:43     
um and like cons and like like the the     
36:49     
response to intelligent design and the watchmaker stuff and then there was you know stuff before that and it was it's     
36:56     
it's actually a really interesting L for me to to kind of look at a lot of philosophical content in the past that     
37:02     
I've I've not been interested in at all dealing with um just because it was I     
37:08     
don't know it's been a very interesting lens to kind of put into     
37:14     
um like these big huge things um like obviously theology goes way all the way     
37:22     
back you know like like um but but seeing the different in in well     
37:28     
incarnations of it evolved during the Middle Ages or medieval stuff     
37:35     
and then getting into like actually getting     
37:40     
into um The Age of Enlightenment and the     
37:46     
Scientific Revolution before that and how things what what the Battlegrounds were     
37:52     
was an interesting uh space and I've written I've written some things like to to condense that for the smaller post that     
37:59     
I'm writing but I'm kind of wondering in the future like I     
38:04     
might what's what's sort of the actual story that I want to say about that that's been on my mind a bit because     
38:13     
um you know in in one sense and I I kind of want to look a little bit more into     
38:18     
it like it's sort of one thing to say okay so 1943 paper uh where you know our     
38:25     
our three our three Heroes are are you know going against the grain against the     
38:31     
the sort of recent disinterest in um discrediting of purpose but it's it     
38:39     
feels like that's um an underselling of what's Happening     
38:45     
both like in a in a broader sense too um like it's not it's not there a lot     
38:52     
there's a lot going on and it's not like they're uh they're not just Radley     
38:58     
articulated this very well in the last in the last meeting so I'm probably not doing I'm not trying to I'm not trying     
39:03     
to do his comments Justice either um but just understanding that space and and     
39:10     
what and kind of the separating out of you know non-mystical theology uh away from that and what does     
39:17     
that mean for this other stuff um and I I feel like     
39:23     
there's there's something to to really go into and terms of a lot of all the     
39:29     
recent like some of the recent people we've been looking at like I haven't gotten to this part yet and something that I like to talk more about maybe     
39:37     
talk more about in like one of our non Saturday meetings next week     
39:42     
but um even like returning to Thomas fukes a little bit and his Ecology of the brain stuff and his his take on like     
39:52     
okay yes anti-reductionism the the the paper itself comes up in l t the time     
39:57     
and he's sort of dealing with this sort of AG gental material stuff what is you know that's a whole I guess modern     
40:06     
biological heavy take on it and then you have David     
40:12     
Kau uh who kind of started this thing off with Bradley     
40:19     
mentioned the complex world book um and the talk around it so it's     
40:24     
kind of I'm I I see this in in in what I'm putting     
40:30     
together I'm seeing this like going into you know the the natural contemporary     
40:36     
people in these issues looking at the stuff and in in these different fields and actually think there's something also about metascience to be said here     
40:43     
too or some of the the broader efforts there but I haven't I haven't quite figured it out yet um I was hoping to     
40:51     
submit this just to the medium and and not basically just to Bradley to because I think Bradley will want to say some     
40:56     
things but I guess I guess where am I coming to with all this is sort of saying okay there's a post to be said     
41:01     
about the paper in our discussion for um and I've already mentioned     
41:06     
something that I'm there's a longer project with David crack hour's particular take in complexity science     
41:12     
which I don't really would know how to properly frame yet relative to other things because I don't think     
41:19     
everyone I'm sure that everyone in the complexity space and see things the way that he     
41:25     
does um but I find myself on this path of trying to     
41:30     
investigate um some of some of that stuff and yes like the philosophy of History stuff and and the history of     
41:37     
quote unquote science and the history of genology is a very interesting space and I don't I don't really want to spend a     
41:42     
whole lot of time there but I feel like I'm in the process of getting this     
41:48     
broader um inertial understanding um that was     
41:55     
exciting uh this week so bottom line um I think I will still     
42:01     
try to submit a somewhat smaller thing but if kind of get it as I'm learning     
42:07     
it's like okay should this become in appendex or should this become a different like a paper Al together because when you get to like actually     
42:13     
broader sense of chology and all of the stuff and like there's something that you just don't want to get into you know     
42:20     
um going further back and like there's obvious things that like yeah we got to stay very very very you know very     
42:28     
very getting reating to the sense of what all the baggage that it     
42:33     
has is another way to think about it um so um I still plan to send that     
42:40     
hopefully uh today um in in at least in a bridge     
42:46     
version and then when I show that I wouldn't mind a discussion regard or maybe other people in next week too but     
42:52     
just like what you know like what um what     
42:57     
[Music] um ideas for Future Works based on where     
43:02     
we go with that and and I know things kind of dovetail here with our efforts um and other cybernetical things we want     
43:09     
to do so I think maybe kind of a maybe part of the next cybernetics reading     
43:14     
group meeting I don't think May is him I think part of the next meeting maybe     
43:19     
either Wednesday or Thursday meetings let's say I think there should maybe be a little bit time spent on um     
43:27     
one I kind of have my vision for where I want to go with things and I can just I'll just you know go there on my own     
43:33     
but also like what I guess offering relative to what I'm inclined to do see     
43:39     
what if people want to you know do do anything further     
43:45     
um in those spaces I suppose and what what they have in mind for for how to     
43:51     
either read stuff or do make make some materials on it ahead so that was any     
43:57     
questions about that I was pretty um unstructured but it's fine yeah it's great thank you     
44:06     
uh I look forward to reading the blog post um and yeah I've been kind of     
44:12     
interested in this topic too I think you know we're going to talk about that in the active um presentation but I think     
44:20     
there's a lot more to say about that I have some notes on it myself so we should kind of merge things together     
44:28     
yeah it's it's it's one of those things     
44:33     
where I found myself surprised I I think I think     
44:39     
that's that's um a fair way to say it surprised in the sense of oh there's actually a little bit more here that I     
44:48     
feel I want to get into and also would be good to understand like like even     
44:54     
outside of uh I don't know not just the historical stuff but I     
45:01     
think the historical stuff is more [Music]     
45:07     
um like there's there's there's a much there's much more at play than I     
45:13     
guess I originally understood in some ways so that's cool and then also like     
45:18     
again going into the actual modern like uh fuk Le and C like     
45:25     
there's there's something there and I don't I don't know what yet but um     
45:32     
yeah anyway yes we'll talk talk more about that ahead um other stuff happening     
45:37     
um uh we didn't have our regular meetings this week um I think next time     
45:45     
for the Cyber well in the in the reading group or one of the reading groups we we will be     
45:51     
looking at the bson memory paper I know Amanda was interested in that and and that's on on the top on on the agenda I     
45:58     
looked a little bit at that it was quite interesting kind of about where you know where our memories what are memories stuff like that um if I'm remembering     
46:05     
that right and um there was I was reading I looking at     
46:12     
another video from 11 a while ago which I think also came up came up again with the Rosen BL uh I don't know what to     
46:20     
call it chart tab tabulation table uh where they select for you know     
46:26     
prediction various orders of prediction um but but like like getting getting into why you     
46:34     
know why they selected for prediction why why they're trying to differentiate theological stuff why they're trying to     
46:40     
look at this groundwork for like an assessment level so a way to assess both like natural and artificial behavior um     
46:49     
and and where they were in that process of what they can see from there and so on so but yeah interesting stuff um     
46:57     
we'll do that next week um I will be I will     
47:03     
be I guess the EAS way to say is traveling a bit next week but I should     
47:09     
be able to make our meetings as usual um but I I'll I'll say more about that as     
47:16     
it comes up but that's my I will uh return the mic to you br okay well thank     
47:23     
you Jesse for the up looks like Morgan is why don't you say     
47:31     
something just um one I I I thought that the the crack hour lecture was was     
47:39     
particularly funny when he when he was trying to he was talking about the different definitions of complex     
47:47     
science right and then he was that I think he read     
47:53     
out gelas or you know someone associated     
47:59     
with you know he read out this portion and he was just like I'm not sure that's     
48:05     
helpful like I'm not sure that cleared things up way the way he put it you know     
48:14     
uh but uh but a lot of good you know a lot of great material covered there and     
48:20     
and I wasn't sure yeah if if we wanted to make that a     
48:26     
focus or wait for the book or um is the book available oh yes he said he was     
48:32     
signing oh okay so okay it's it's like $6 so it's okay um I actually almost     
48:41     
ordered a second one because I I'm I'm somewhat notorious for having     
48:46     
books I mean everybody I click books don't read them haha but like I don't I don't I really don't I I don't     
48:53     
physically enjoy having a physical material book and reading a physical mat book um most of the time uh so it's kind     
49:01     
of funny because I actually decided to physically hold this book also there isn't a there isn't there there's     
49:07     
certain things that that the SFI is doing is like oh it's it's like you know license inhibit license cost restrictive     
49:16     
uh for us to sell we can give you a PDF of the book so so this is basically what it comes     
49:23     
down to so like I bought the phys it's super cheap but like I bought the physical copy anyway and then I I lost     
49:28     
it for a bit I found it again so is it called complex world     
49:36     
yeah um but uh outside of that yes that's     
49:43     
what the book is um and it's nice because it has a a     
49:48     
um well I think has a broad overview but then I'm also curious to find their other books on the like the foundational     
49:55     
papers because apparently those books are like they'll have like U like Maxim     
50:00     
rinsky going through a contemporary person looking at a topic or or someone     
50:05     
looking at the aruro paper someone looking at these modern people modern complexity scientists looking at these     
50:13     
foundational papers so that that should be fun I haven't I haven't really seen anything on them I don't like you know     
50:18     
the commentaries are yet that should be good uh outside of that I realized I just I put this I kind of blab this all     
50:25     
over the the chat ear this week and I forgot about it until just now     
50:31     
um I think one of like we're familiar some with the S to and the complexity     
50:37     
Explorer and they had a complexity podcast for a while and it's quite funny because um I found out about it a while     
50:44     
ago and I I don't really know what to make of it and I I didn't I didn't get into it um but I I I was Loosely     
50:53     
following Michael Garfield as the lead of the podcast like back when I used     
50:58     
Facebook more which is feel like a long time ago but he would post there about it and I'd see updates from Michael     
51:04     
Garfield I don't know if I was friend with Michael Garfield whatever um but like for some reason I remember getting     
51:10     
updates a long time ago fice to say I found one of the earlier podcasts I     
51:15     
think the complex science podcast has changed or Michael gar isn't hosting anymore I don't     
51:21     
remember um but there was like this one the you know David KRA on the landscape     
51:27     
of 21st century science is the title but it is very interesting and I think I I     
51:32     
would actually like to um I mean I guess it could feed into our     
51:38     
talk on open science somewhat um because the SP part of the discussion there is     
51:46     
um not just you know about complexity but how science has changed over a while     
51:53     
like the kind of were were a little bit familiar with the lab now about oh the     
52:00     
the efforts against reductionism and and why reduction went the way that it did and the useful of the usefulness of it     
52:07     
the importance of it why it went this way David talks about like um his role     
52:14     
is as kind of you know     
52:19     
shepher uh this small small group of people in Santa Fe     
52:26     
in the mountains or whatever that aren't beholden     
52:31     
to uh you know what kind of risks they can take they can't take a lot of Financial     
52:37     
Risk because they don't have the money for it and whatever but they can do some certain ideational risk they can do these they can they can have certain     
52:43     
discussions that are harder to have and and they're very you know Stu that that felt a little bit     
52:51     
uh nice or or or you know a certain kind     
52:56     
of Brotherhood if you will with some of what orthogonal does in the sense of     
53:01     
we're we have the kind of risk that we take and don't take and why um which is maybe a     
53:08     
strange way to to phrase everything that's happening because it's we don't like talk about risks here but the nature of guiding people through     
53:14     
interdisiplinary work and then how you know how he uh offers spaces for them to     
53:23     
grow and and then eventually potentially leave the institution to do this stuff and how does that fit     
53:28     
with complexity how does it fit with science how does it fit with what kind of you know ideas and things you're     
53:33     
working with there a very interesting like what he's doing in the lab and how that fits with the broader you know     
53:40     
landscape of the the um 21st century of     
53:46     
Science and the opening I think even in the captain is like the opening line of the captain of the the podcast or     
53:52     
whatever is for 300 years the dream of science was to understand the world by chopping it up into pieces and kind of     
53:59     
you know goes goes from there into the like mechanism and reductionism and stuff like that it's like okay um it's     
54:06     
just a nice um I don't know it was it's very     
54:11     
interesting talk and in the talk my last my last thing I'll say about it was     
54:16     
there's Michael Garfield I think referenced verella and uncoming aware     
54:21     
and sort of the different the different components of doing research or getting an idea like having it and it's an idea     
54:28     
at its Inception and how that's the very first person and moving from me towards second person stuff and trying to get a     
54:33     
dialogue about it um and then like getting third person into the world in different ways and it was a fun it was a     
54:40     
funny uh uh a pleasant reference that we we're familiar with from stuff so it was     
54:46     
it was an enjoyable uh discussion but     
54:52     
um I will leave it at that we can talk about other stuff now so     
54:59     
I think it's interesting it's not it's not available at Pal's books but it it's     
55:05     
it's it is on Amazon of course yeah yeah I didn't find it in some local places     
55:10     
here either which is but it's also new but I think it's also like kind of limited     
55:17     
yeah we we live in the age of the Borg um     
55:24     
uh wanted to well I I I have a further update it's not not     
55:30     
totally relevant to this but the     
55:37     
um but you you brought up 11 just a bit ago and um     
55:43     
the uh cortical Labs Journal Club     
55:49     
um you know cortical Labs is this startup down in Australia that is     
55:57     
doing let's not say let's not call it organoid intelligence Dish Dish brain     
56:02     
yeah dis dish brain um as a as a     
56:07     
product and um they just did the brain aware paper     
56:14     
from Indiana um um but we're are talking about doing     
56:22     
the tame the Michael 11 tame paper next     
56:28     
okay so wanted wanted to advertise that because um     
56:34     
um yeah it would be it would be cool to to potentially show up for those who     
56:41     
could and and um represent with a group of people that     
56:47     
are doing are definitely like organoid uh intelligence interested     
56:58     
yeah any just wanted to mention that oh that's good yeah um I don't know if you     
57:06     
have like links for that or what I I'll get i'll get links on yeah for sure all     
57:11     
right I just I just saw that they had a they they they don't have a date yet     
57:18     
it would be probably like a little after mid October     
57:24     
yeah um yes so uh yeah I think we should have like maybe more of an explicit sort     
57:31     
of complexity and a focus or you know do things that are more in in sort of     
57:38     
forward facing in terms of complexity uh I mean we do things but it's kind of like they're not really     
57:45     
advertised as such or they're not really thought of as such so I think that's very good stuff I think also you know     
57:51     
having this connection between open science and complexity science that's also another thing that maybe we could     
57:57     
look at for this event with act inference because they they're     
58:02     
interested in complexity Theory it's not again like you know in our case it's not     
58:08     
really that forward facing so they're doing a lot of things in that space but it's kind of like how do we make it sort     
58:15     
of I wouldn't say like exactly like the Santa Fe model but the think the Santa model has been somewhat effective at     
58:22     
like public uh consumption of complexity and tying that to maybe well I don't     
58:28     
know if they they don't really do a lot of open science at least explicitly you     
58:33     
know they don't have like a lot of tools that they build and put out in the world but you get the ideas and you know it's     
58:40     
it's that's that's the kind of Direction you want to go because you know uh so     
58:46     
that this is something we should talk about more you know in the coming weeks     
58:51     
we're in slack yeah I mean I I think that's that's actually particularly interesting     
58:58     
I mean I think one of the reasons that they don't is that they don't that that I mean I could     
59:05     
definitely imagine speakers coming and I can think of a few people who've who've     
59:10     
spoken and are potentially like external SFI     
59:15     
faculty that have talked about some of those relationships but or or like relationship but I I     
59:24     
think it's also just yeah like they they somebody just needs to draw those     
59:30     
connections for them you know just thinking about in particular I I     
59:37     
think maybe it was like how he was introduced by Jeffrey West um as you know like like David     
59:47     
cra's thing is is following what do they say like um     
59:56     
following the kind of um the different means of     
1:00:02     
intellectual pursuit or organization I forget the I forget the way he he phrased it but it it made me think of     
1:00:10     
actually um uh uh the most recent work of     
1:00:17     
um oh god um this is this is this is my professor from like     
1:00:24     
1993 uh uh Mark bedau right so early aife     
1:00:30     
researcher right like like I think he had something in the     
1:00:35     
2000s where um he was doing kind of like     
1:00:41     
analysis of us patents oh yeah I know that paper yeah yeah it's together with     
1:00:47     
somebody else that I think was like down in Santa Fe but not necessarily     
1:00:53     
SFI s yeah yeah yeah but you know what I mean     
1:00:58     
like like like you know it's um u i mean this is this is the this is what makes     
1:01:06     
complexity sign so hard to Define right it's like it could L be almost     
1:01:11     
anything right it's about it's about drawing the connections it's about you know as well as like as as well as um     
1:01:20     
having the data or you know like having having an interesting data set uh or CH     
1:01:27     
choosing an interesting perspective on on on data     
1:01:33     
um anyway I think that would be cool to think about the     
1:01:39     
the yeah like H how how Would S how does SF How would how would SFI think about     
1:01:46     
software or software communities and their their relationships especially in     
1:01:53     
open source just thinking again like about about the kind of the Linux community     
1:01:59     
and the the Linux community of the greater Linux community of tools and and     
1:02:04     
how they share and and how they divide up you know kind of how they how they     
1:02:12     
create their niches and how they um how they     
1:02:18     
interoperate yeah Etc yeah I actually cover some of that     
1:02:23     
in my project management class but I don't have like a complex I don't have an explicit complexity theme or lecture     
1:02:31     
I guess I do have a lecture on complexity but there's a lot of complexity stuff in there it's like     
1:02:36     
there's a lot to say about that as well like I think like the Linux Space is really good example because there's so     
1:02:42     
much going on that you could if I don't know where you if they have data on     
1:02:47     
things or if you have to sort of collect it from they do or you know like like I I     
1:02:53     
can certainly think of you know smaller perspectives where people just look at like Colonel development right right     
1:03:00     
because they got this this massive history data set you know as well as     
1:03:06     
like the communication surrounding it in terms of the mailing list and things like that but um yeah that     
1:03:16     
definitely interesting here yeah all right um so yeah thanks for     
1:03:22     
that discussion I think that's something really interesting that you can follow up on talk     
1:03:29     
about all right I'm going to talk about hyper neat and uh some tools associated with     
1:03:37     
it you know what it is all right uh so it's not like a an obsessive compulsive     
1:03:43     
person it's a platform for uh doing evolutionary computation and some neuro     
1:03:50     
Evolution stuff so this is hyper neat um it's a platform that was developed by     
1:03:57     
Kenneth Stanley and colleagues uh so this is the Wikipedia page it's uh hyper Cube based neat or     
1:04:06     
hyper neat so neat is the neuroevolution of augmented topologies that was     
1:04:12     
developed by Kenneth Stanley and Hyper neat or hyper Cube based neat is a     
1:04:18     
version of neat so uh hyperne is a generative encoding that involves     
1:04:25     
artifici evolves artificial neural networks or Anns with the principles of     
1:04:30     
neat it is a novel technique for evolving large scale neural networks using the geometric regularities of the     
1:04:37     
task domain uh so it's the sort of geometric approach and we've talked about     
1:04:42     
information geometry before it's kind of consistent with that and when you're talking about hyper cubes you're putting     
1:04:48     
it in this space that's uh you know allows you to uh build this binary hyper Cube and     
1:04:57     
then watch things evolve in that space um so I don't know if we're going to     
1:05:02     
have an example of it here but basically that's what they're trying to do they're using these agents that have uh evolving     
1:05:10     
artificial neural networks and they look at how they sort of evolve over time uh     
1:05:15     
and and examine that process uh it uses compositional pattern     
1:05:22     
producing networks or cppns which are us to generate the images of     
1:05:27     
picker. so this is pick breeder     
1:05:35     
here don't know if it's still online let's     
1:05:41     
see okay I don't think that's uh online so pb.org     
1:05:47     
uh and there other things like endless forms.com and things like that hyperne     
1:05:53     
has recently been extended to also evolve plastic Anns and to evolve the     
1:05:59     
location of every neuron in a network so this uh evolving the location of every     
1:06:05     
neuron in the network that sounds like something that might be useful for uh credit assignment that is Sebastian     
1:06:11     
reesi and Kenneth Stanley an enhanced hper Cube based encoding for evolving the placement density and connectivity     
1:06:18     
of neurons that's actually in the artificial life journal that was in 2012 so that's um you know kind of thinking     
1:06:26     
about sort of um you know how neurons are placed in     
1:06:32     
a in a network and looking at this hyper hyper Cube based encoding so this is the     
1:06:37     
thing that they're using in hyperne uh then also uh comp cppn are     
1:06:44     
compositional pattern producing networks so this is where they take it an     
1:06:49     
artificial neural network and they evolve it using gen genetic algorithms different versions of genetic algorithms     
1:06:57     
and then this uh paper here associated with that is by Kenneth Stanley from     
1:07:03     
2007 compositional pattern producing networks the novel abstraction of development so this is actually going     
1:07:10     
back to developmental Pro developmental biology and the programming of Developmental     
1:07:16     
systems and things like that basically trying to will develop a a network     
1:07:22     
genetic programming and evolvable machines is the journal and that's from 2007 so this is basically you know kind     
1:07:29     
of the the very uh quick overview of things uh they     
1:07:36     
have a list of applications multi-agent learning checkers board evaluation     
1:07:42     
controlling leg robots uh comparing generative and direc encodings     
1:07:47     
investigating the evolution of modular andal networks evolving objects that can be 3D printed evolving the neural     
1:07:54     
geometry and plasticity of an artificial so there are a lot of applications to     
1:08:01     
that uh actually let's look at this paper if we     
1:08:08     
can so this is the paper original paper by Ken Stanley on compositional pattern     
1:08:14     
producing networks a novel abstraction of development and this is a genetic     
1:08:19     
programming and evolable machines this is a journal that does a lot of stuff uh     
1:08:24     
publishes stuff in in uh genetic programming and genetic algorithms there's a whole taxonomy of of     
1:08:31     
approaches related to uh like genetic programming and genetic algorithms uh     
1:08:37     
basically evolutionary computation is the larger category uh so you know you     
1:08:43     
we talk about these different methods they're just very uh specialized versions of evolutionary     
1:08:52     
computation so uh the abstract reads natural DNA can encode complexity in an     
1:08:57     
enormous scale so they're looking at this sort of encoding of a of a chromosome or a gene using uh you know     
1:09:07     
binary strings or other types of uh structures as sort of artificial     
1:09:13     
DNA uh researchers are attempting to achieve the same representational efficiency in computers by implementing     
1:09:20     
developmental encodings so this is uh where they're kind of coming with developmental     
1:09:27     
encodings uh and when they talk about developmental encodings what they mean are encodings that map the genotype to     
1:09:34     
the phenotype through a process of growth from a small starting point to a     
1:09:40     
mature form so they're looking at this like they're trying to develop a map of     
1:09:47     
taking like a a genomic encoding or an encoding of the DNA mapping it to a     
1:09:54     
phenotype it could be a one toone mapping of course in biology we know that's not really the way it works it's     
1:10:00     
a multi- to multi encoding anyways they're just trying to map some     
1:10:06     
representation to Something in the world like a phenotype they're using growth as may be     
1:10:11     
their starting point and they basically can grow things in that way uh a major     
1:10:18     
challenge is in this effort is to find the right level of abstraction of biological development to capture its     
1:10:24     
essential properties without introducing unnecessary inefficiencies so this is basically     
1:10:30     
where they're trying to find the way to kind of transform things developmentally it's kind of like what     
1:10:37     
we're doing in some of the work on in Dev AI um and you know this is kind of     
1:10:42     
the the standard approach for you know because obviously you want to get down     
1:10:48     
to the genetic level you want to have this kind of genotype to phenotype map and then you want to be able to     
1:10:54     
differenti things I think the way we've kind of done it is to not focus on     
1:11:00     
growth as much as transformation but this is just kind of different ways of doing this so in this paper a novel     
1:11:07     
abstraction of natural development called compositional pattern producing networks or cppn as proposed so this is     
1:11:15     
where they're actually wanting to put patterns together in a growth this and     
1:11:21     
the Network's producing these different patterns and it's just composing different aspects of it unlike currently     
1:11:28     
accepted abstractions such as iterative rewrite systems and cellular growth simulations cellular growth simulations     
1:11:35     
being something you know like um well some of the platforms that we've talked     
1:11:40     
about in D.A wor aot um and so that you know that's one way to do that you also     
1:11:47     
have these iterative rewrite systems which are basically introducing uh you know variation into     
1:11:53     
the process uh cppns map to the phenotype without local interaction that     
1:11:59     
is each individual component of the phenotype is determined independently of every other component     
1:12:06     
so this is where you have like maybe so let's let's map this out uh so let's say     
1:12:11     
you have this little organism here that's like five LS maybe a     
1:12:16     
gingerbread man um and then you have this genotype to phenotype     
1:12:23     
mapping and the map is just simple taking like a series of     
1:12:31     
strings and it could be binary strings so is are zero and     
1:12:39     
one and then those binary strings map to some set of features in the phenotype so     
1:12:46     
this is phenotype this is genotype and the phenotype is here so we might have like this Gene here mapped to     
1:12:55     
this limb this Gene here mapped to the limb over     
1:13:00     
here this Gene here ma to this leg this Gene M to this leg and this Gene mapped     
1:13:08     
to the Head okay and it's just ordered that way it's a very simple map it's     
1:13:14     
more or less correspondence so if you have this Gene it maps to something the features of this hat are all encoded in     
1:13:21     
here and of course they all are independent so you can knock out this Gene and knock out the head and you     
1:13:29     
would just have like not a tetrapod anymore you would have a headless gingerbread H where you could mutate     
1:13:37     
this Gene in different ways and change it as part of the phenotype okay so it's     
1:13:42     
compositional in the sense that it's pulling together you know it's kind of     
1:13:50     
like if you were to pull together like all these parts and you were Express     
1:13:56     
these in development you would get basically this form but these in operate     
1:14:01     
independently so you can knock one out and have like you know just four limbs instead of five uh there is no     
1:14:08     
interaction between these genes it's just that these are modular so the genotype is you know     
1:14:16     
modular and you know you put the pieces together so you put 1+ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 and     
1:14:24     
you went up with your phenotype if you knock out two and four     
1:14:29     
you end up with a phenotype that has 1 plus 3 + 5 and so on and so forth the     
1:14:34     
other thing is you have the phenotype developed in pieces now in biology of course A lot of times you have things     
1:14:41     
that are linked so like you know your limbs might be controlled by say like     
1:14:47     
Hawk gene or something and then that controls the expression of other genes     
1:14:53     
so you might have the Gen maybe for the for the for limbs for the     
1:14:59     
uh for the for limbs here for the legs and those are different genes so this     
1:15:04     
would be for limbs this would be legs this would be the Hawks which would just     
1:15:10     
sort of regulate the growth of these you don't have that in C cppn but it's     
1:15:16     
basically compositional and if you're looking to uh build something that     
1:15:22     
is um you know a modular highly modular then that's what you kind of want so     
1:15:29     
results produced with cppns their interactive evolution of two-dimensional images and so this is where we go back     
1:15:36     
to the pick breeder stuff and I'm not sure if people have ever seen one of these but it's basically a platform     
1:15:42     
where you have like you give it a bunch of images you train the model on a bunch of images and then you are you know you     
1:15:51     
generate a bunch of images from that and then you select the images that you find     
1:15:56     
interesting or beautiful or whatever and then that's acts as natural selection it     
1:16:02     
then generates more images but on the basis of the thing you selected So eventually you can keep selecting for     
1:16:09     
images and you get this subset of images that kind of goes in the direction that you're selecting     
1:16:15     
for and so this is how cpn's going of take this phenotype and like refine     
1:16:22     
different uh things in it and build from like Primitives and give you sort of     
1:16:28     
this uh you know this sort of thing of high Fitness in this case Fitness being     
1:16:34     
Beauty but you could do this with actual phenotypes a lot of robotic control     
1:16:39     
problems use this Etc uh results produced with cppns     
1:16:46     
through interactive evolution of two-dimensional images show that such an encoding can nevertheless produce     
1:16:51     
structural motifs often attributed to more conventional developmental abstractions suggesting that local     
1:16:58     
interaction may not be essential to the desirable properties of natural encoding     
1:17:03     
the way that is usually assumed so that means that we don't care about local interaction so     
1:17:10     
much uh you know we we have these structural motifs that are important these these Primitives that are kind of     
1:17:17     
you know based on comp you know the the components of a phenotype or the     
1:17:22     
components of a problem space you think about this in terms of a problem space     
1:17:28     
you know you might have hyper Cube just you know if we look at it like     
1:17:35     
this it's kind of like a three-dimensional square but we're just looking at sort of skeleton of that so     
1:17:42     
we have nodes that kind of are like this and then we have a cube nested     
1:17:49     
within that Cube so we have a cube here     
1:17:55     
we have like connections here it's kind of hard to draw because     
1:18:01     
it's like you have this you know drawing a nested cube is     
1:18:07     
hard but we'll do this real quick here get to the     
1:18:15     
point it's basically just kind of like this a cube within a cube     
1:18:21     
okay so yeah I didn't draw the back of this Cube here     
1:18:26     
but anyways we have a lot of things going on here um and so each of these     
1:18:32     
nodes have like a value so it could be like four don't how many we have here uh but     
1:18:41     
you're the idea is you're trying to go from this start initial point to this     
1:18:47     
end point so you're trying to say introduce mutation at each of these     
1:18:53     
steps that give you like kind of a mutated phenotype the phenotype being     
1:18:59     
binary uh values actually that would be the genotype but the phenotype would be     
1:19:05     
kind of the route that it takes through the hyper Cube so if you travel if you     
1:19:10     
give this initial condition or Zero's two mutations you end up with this state of     
1:19:16     
the genotype and you end up with these edges as the pheny these uh States as     
1:19:23     
the genotype and you end up with these edges as the phenotype so you can actually map out the phenotype that way     
1:19:30     
and then put together phenotypes to build a whole U you know a phenotype a     
1:19:36     
compositional phenotype so yeah this is kind of the     
1:19:42     
basis for uh neat and hypernet and so hypernet uses hyper Cubes but these in a     
1:19:49     
different way than what I was just showing so um you know there are different references here     
1:19:55     
um this is another reference by Sebastian reesi and Kenneth Stanley indirecting indirectly encoding     
1:20:01     
neuroplasticity is a pattern of local rules this is in from animals to animats     
1:20:07     
11 which is a conference proceeding from a conference uh called from animals to     
1:20:14     
animats um um now next thing I want to talk about here is that we have a series     
1:20:19     
of GitHub repositories uh that have hyperne involved in them so there are a lot of     
1:20:25     
ways you can Implement hyperne uh there tools and tensor flow uh there are other     
1:20:32     
types of libraries for hypernet where you're combining it with uh other types     
1:20:38     
of uh approaches you have dpiper neat which uh     
1:20:45     
is Ken this is developed by theel exosa and Kenne ofth Stanley it's based on     
1:20:50     
this paper here um you have all sorts of different you can actually Implement     
1:20:56     
sharp need and unity uh there's Unity need as a project so this is kind of     
1:21:01     
interesting that they're using it kind of intersects with unity and some of the you know     
1:21:07     
three-dimensional uh modeling that's going on there the implementation of     
1:21:12     
evolvable substr hypernet algorithm and go so this is where we have es hypernet     
1:21:18     
being an extension of the original hypernet method uh while lot of things here that     
1:21:25     
you know if you're interested in applying this uh to a lot of people were doing this to uh develop uh actual     
1:21:35     
brains for like robots and things like that so this is actually the neuroevolution knowledge base this is     
1:21:41     
someone's take on neuro on neuroevolution Research uh yeah so there are a lot of     
1:21:47     
resources here what in Julia here the piper need in Julia so a lot of     
1:21:52     
resources here for people to look at I can put this in the slack for people to     
1:21:58     
go this is a medium post hyperne approach and evolution this is uh where     
1:22:05     
they talk a little bit about hyperne uh basically extending the capabilities of evolutionary     
1:22:12     
computation particularly in evolving artificial neural networks hypernet stands out for its ability to harness     
1:22:19     
geometric regularities and network topology Paving the way for evolving large SC scale efficient neural networks     
1:22:26     
so hyperne is really focused on evolving neural networks um your the neural networks     
1:22:33     
then serve as the encoding for some phenotype so what I was describing was     
1:22:38     
kind of a general genotype to phenotype mapping to some geometric phenotype now in hypernet you're     
1:22:45     
actually using the nodes of the uh Network and you're evolving that Network     
1:22:51     
and then you're producing something from that Network this article delves into the intricacies     
1:22:57     
of hypernet exploring its foundational principles operational mechanics and its     
1:23:03     
impactful role in the broader context of machine learning and artificial intelligence so they talk about     
1:23:08     
neuroevolution being a subset of evolutionary algorithms focused on evolving neural networks and how those     
1:23:15     
in turn to evolve from simple structures to complex architectures capable of tackling a     
1:23:21     
myriad of challenging tasks uh the the introduction of hyperne marked a turning point in this Evolution     
1:23:28     
offering a novel perspective on how neural networks can be developed and optimized so uh let's see uh so the     
1:23:36     
foundational concepts are that you uh hyper NE approach is an extension of     
1:23:42     
neat the neat algorithm was originally designed to evolve both the topology and     
1:23:48     
weights of neural networks so they're actually mapping their genotype to their     
1:23:54     
phenotype which are these typology and weights problem and real grps the Crux     
1:23:59     
of hypernet lies in its indirect encoding mechanism which uses a compositional pattern producing Network     
1:24:05     
which we saw in the foundational paper for to encode connectivity patterns of     
1:24:10     
artificial neural networks as a function of geometry so the phenotype really is     
1:24:16     
embedded in this geometry in this geometric space and that's really kind     
1:24:22     
of one of the key points is that there is this underlying kind of metric space     
1:24:27     
or geometry this approach allows for the efficient representation of large networks with inherent regularities such     
1:24:34     
as Symmetry and repetition which are often observed in natural biological networks so you know you have these     
1:24:42     
networks these neural networks that have these regularities symmetry repetition     
1:24:48     
and you'll see this in brains as well with the placement of neurons and the     
1:24:53     
neural structures that result from you know uh morph Genesis so it's     
1:24:59     
interesting compositional pattern producing networks are a form of artificial neural network uh unlike traditional neural     
1:25:07     
networks cppns are not designed for tests by classification and regression I     
1:25:12     
think this is an important Point um instead they used to generate patterns     
1:25:17     
and structures which can be applied in various domains so cppns are exclusively     
1:25:24     
General generative they are not you know they don't really produce classifications per se they just produce     
1:25:30     
as patterns and then you know you can do things with those patterns put them together into larger things you know     
1:25:37     
take those motifs build up you have repetition you have symmetry you can     
1:25:42     
build things with it um these patterns and structures can be applied in various domains especially     
1:25:49     
in evolving the topology and weights of artificial neural networks at their or cppns are inspired by the processes of     
1:25:57     
natural development in morphogenesis the biological process that governs the shape and form of an     
1:26:03     
organism they use a composition of mathematical functions that create complex patterns these patterns can     
1:26:09     
manifest in various ways from symmetric structures found in biological organisms to intricate designs and network     
1:26:16     
topologies the structure of a c APN resembles that of a standard NE Network     
1:26:22     
consisting of nodes and connections however the key difference lies in the diversity of activation functions used     
1:26:28     
in the nodes so Ann's might use a single type of activation function across the     
1:26:34     
network so you might pick Ru or sigmoid and that's your activation function for     
1:26:39     
the Whole Net cppns by contrast employ a variety of functions such as gausian s     
1:26:47     
cosine and sigma this diversity allows cppn to produce a wide range of output     
1:26:52     
patterns depending on the inputs and the arrangement of these functions within the network so you have this diversity     
1:26:59     
of different activation functions presumably mimicking like how different     
1:27:04     
types of neurons exist in the brain and they have different activation functions and they produce different types of     
1:27:11     
outputs so this is you know kind of a way to can evolve kind of brains in a     
1:27:16     
modular way uh basic compositional pattern producing networks in Python     
1:27:22     
involve defining a network that can generate patterns based on its input coordinates so you need to have uh in     
1:27:29     
this implementing this in Python and they have the code here you define a     
1:27:35     
network uh that can generate patterns based on input coordinance so you have     
1:27:41     
uh this example in Python of a cppn this example will create a basic     
1:27:47     
cppn and use it to generate a two-dimensional pattern so you have this uh class cppn it kind of goes this     
1:27:54     
you're importing think you're using numpy uh and then it uses this class uh     
1:28:02     
you have a function here for Activation so uh or you have a number of activation functions here basically it's walking     
1:28:09     
through the different activation functions um and it's it's choosing from     
1:28:16     
a uh 10 sin and gausian so you have these different activation functions or     
1:28:22     
if none of those fit the data then produces returns linear return x uh and     
1:28:29     
then your another function where you are defining uh the activation functions and     
1:28:37     
doing that and then you're creating cppn input size hidden layers output size     
1:28:43     
create a 2d pattern would generate a 2d pattern on an array and that's what     
1:28:48     
we're doing here and then we plot it out so this is what it looks like uh generated pattern by cppn you have this     
1:28:55     
radiant of color from yellow to Blue and you can see it's like kind of a color     
1:29:00     
map a nice uh pattern there and so this is generated all from this neural     
1:29:06     
network that has different activation functions and can just put out this phenotype on this two-dimensional array     
1:29:14     
so this is a two-dimensional numpy array so this is a very simple phenotype it has you know components that you can     
1:29:21     
look at say these are these could be modular you have an area of blue you have an area of yellow and these are all     
1:29:27     
produced by these different activation functions this variation across the the gradient um if we consider this array as     
1:29:36     
an artificial neural spatial substrat patter I don't know what that     
1:29:41     
means uh so each element could correspond to the weight of a connection where the activation of level of a     
1:29:48     
neuron in Ann for specific spatial prats so basically uh I guess there ways to do     
1:29:56     
uh spatial correspondence in artificial neural networks and it's basically kind     
1:30:02     
of what the cppn is doing so we can make a 3D     
1:30:07     
visualization and you know we have another example here where we uh output     
1:30:13     
these different points in space so we have this ke three-dimensional Cube where we put all plot out all these     
1:30:20     
points it's basically uh you know visualizing an artificial neural network     
1:30:26     
based on this uh cppn pattern because we have these uh you know features in here     
1:30:33     
that are ordered we can actually plot this out as a as a scatter plot instead of a gradient and we can get this uh so     
1:30:41     
basically we're iterating through the grid and plotting neurons at the output above threshold so basically these are     
1:30:47     
all the active neurons in the cppn network informing to the pattern we saw     
1:30:52     
in the first example as a three-dimensional scatter and so this is     
1:30:58     
where we have our points you can see they're highly ordered in space and so that's what we have there so each Blue     
1:31:05     
Dot represents a neuron in the artificial neural network the X and Y coordinates for each dot corresponds to     
1:31:11     
neuron's position in the two-dimensional substrate and then the z-axis represents     
1:31:17     
the outputs of the cppn for each neuron indicating the strength and nature of the connections from that neuron     
1:31:24     
so this shows how cppns generate a pattern of connectivity across the neural network neurons with higher or     
1:31:31     
lower cppn outputs are more likely to form stronger connections as indicated     
1:31:37     
in their position on the Zed axis here like so they're kind of segregated out they're either high or low on on that     
1:31:45     
axis this 3dv provides a more intuitive understanding of the spatial distribution and connectivity strengths     
1:31:51     
in the Ann is determined by the CN cppn so this kind of goes through this     
1:31:58     
now the last thing I want to show for this is this substrate designer so you     
1:32:03     
can actually create substrates for hyperne and then import them into     
1:32:08     
hyperne so basically this is a nice tool for this uh you can place nodes in this     
1:32:14     
three-dimensional space so why don't we place some nodes     
1:32:19     
here and you can actually do this like you know with a pattern whatever you're     
1:32:25     
choosing this is just designing substrate like that uh and then you can     
1:32:33     
you know you can place or remove input nodes place or remove output nodes which might be the ones down     
1:32:39     
[Music] here okay so you have input nodes output     
1:32:46     
nodes now I want to create dense connections so finish dense connections     
1:32:53     
I don't know I'm doing it but yeah um and then let's try this how about input     
1:32:59     
nodes     
1:33:05     
here that's not doing it way I had it before uh but it's basically creating a couple of things it's creating input     
1:33:12     
nodes in position this two-dimensional array it's doesn't have any hidden nodes     
1:33:17     
and it has these output nodes in red and then it's not defining any connections     
1:33:23     
because I don't know why but then it should you know connect these together if it's working properly     
1:33:28     
and then you can define a layer finish a layer and then you so you basically can design this in in a visual way get all     
1:33:36     
the coordinates here and then you can export the substrate as a Json file and     
1:33:41     
the Json file has everything encoded all the positions and it has you know the annotations and then you put that into     
1:33:49     
hyperne and you can use that substr to do your computation     
1:33:55     
so that's uh just kind of an overview of hypernet and some of the connections with not only artificial neural networks     
1:34:03     
and pattern formation but also this sort of Developmental AI uh     
1:34:13     
aspect okay uh Morgan you had some links in here uh yeah the the first one um so     
1:34:21     
soon as you had U HCK breed her up it made me think of the most recent machine     
1:34:27     
learning Street Talk which again is my a favorite YouTube channel     
1:34:35     
um the the researcher that they are talking with um is also focused on     
1:34:43     
open-ended AI so he's he's very much he's got some projects that are kind of like building on or or certainly     
1:34:52     
inspired by big breeder and and Kev yeah     
1:34:57     
scene was working and then I dropped a link of of what I thought was a     
1:35:05     
um perhaps someone who's recreated pick breeder you know based on the old     
1:35:10     
website like because yeah I think Pig breed. org has been down for a while okay     
1:35:17     
um uh and yeah oh yeah super cool and and     
1:35:27     
you know it's it's uh I I forget which was it the     
1:35:33     
cppm paper it was 2007 anyway yeah I was just I I was I was having     
1:35:41     
a I was having a moment there thinking back to 2007     
1:35:50     
yeah was like what was I doing back that you know yeah it's yeah yeah     
1:35:58     
yeah um so     
1:36:03     
yes yes this yeah and I mean you know we haven't talked I don't know if we've     
1:36:08     
talked too much about neur Evolution but like there a lot of interesting things so you can do like the pick breeder     
1:36:14     
stuff with um you know a regular genetic algorithm so this is the pick breeder     
1:36:21     
site um this is where know you can do things with all sorts of evolutionary computation with genetic algorithms you     
1:36:28     
can even do this with an artificial and you might ask why do you care about evolutionary computation and     
1:36:35     
this sort of thing so you know one of the things you can do of course here is that you're not trying to classify     
1:36:41     
images you're trying to generate new images from a like sort of a database of     
1:36:47     
Primitives or a database of images and then apply natural selection to those IM     
1:36:53     
es to find kind of an optimal solution but you don't know what the optimal     
1:36:59     
solution is until you kind of Select go ahead yeah well and it became it became     
1:37:06     
a kind of interesting um like like Galaxy Zoo it became an     
1:37:13     
interesting uh crowdsourced um you know wait wait for you know wait     
1:37:21     
for a sighting you know kind kind you know in the spirit of of     
1:37:28     
like Wolf's you know uh cellular atoma where it's just like like you on the     
1:37:35     
basis of these simple rules when do you get when when do you see complex uh or     
1:37:42     
you know again it's you're not sure what you're looking for but you know it when     
1:37:48     
you see it right yeah uh that old rule yeah I don't     
1:37:56     
know if you can actually do a demo here but uh it's basically okay so new user I     
1:38:01     
want to start evolving yeah yeah that that was a quick that was a quick yeah yeah yeah so I might like do a     
1:38:10     
mutation let's restart okay here A bunch of images let's mutate if it's     
1:38:17     
working and then you know you can save it I don't know why it's not working the way I would I guess I have to select one     
1:38:26     
maybe well anyways the idea would be you have these images you mutate the images     
1:38:31     
okay there we go mutate and then it mutates them and then they keep mutating and you get variants     
1:38:38     
and you select variants and yeah okay you select a variant you mutate that variant let me     
1:38:45     
select this one and you're mutating it based on the thing you selected so it's creating new variants from the one you     
1:38:51     
selected and then you keep selecting in and eventually you know you might end up with something that's really interesting     
1:38:58     
or desirable so you see I'm shifting this Fitness landscape you know I'm exploring     
1:39:04     
different parts of it if I have this uh purple picture up at the upper right I mutate that I end up selecting for sort     
1:39:12     
of that background color and that General shape now I get like a con set     
1:39:17     
of concentric circles so if I select for that I get a bunch of concentric circles     
1:39:23     
and may keep selecting for concentric circles or I might go to this what looks like a fingerprint orl I may mutate that     
1:39:31     
I get a bunch of those I'll make this one let me keep going I get that I keep     
1:39:36     
going I can like explore sort of this Fitness Peak where I have like this WHL     
1:39:43     
and you know kind of it does I don't know if it ever hits a fitness Peak it just kind of looks like it's exploring     
1:39:49     
the space I was kind of hoping to get it very refined in a fitness landscape you     
1:39:57     
typically have the sort of space or the surface that you know has     
1:40:04     
like uh sort of Fitness values that follow this gradient so you know this     
1:40:09     
landscape of different Fitness values what you're doing is you're trying to when you select for something you're     
1:40:16     
trying to climb this this gradient to what they call an Adaptive Peak or     
1:40:21     
Fitness Peak the idea IDE is that you're trying to increase the fitness of something you're selecting variants that     
1:40:28     
are resemble that and you're trying to get to this peak this Fitness Peak and so you know the idea is if this space is     
1:40:36     
flat you shouldn't have a lot of Fitness Peaks you'll just have a lot of variance being created if you have a high peak     
1:40:43     
like if you have a single Fitness Peak it might just be one type of image that you're just iterating on and trying to     
1:40:50     
optimize for that and a lot of Fitness Landscapes you have multiple Peaks where     
1:40:56     
you need to go and explore them you know you you climb to the top of one Peak and     
1:41:01     
you have to reset the system to one of these valleys to get to another Peak and you can explore that so if I go back to     
1:41:09     
the B breeder you know I might have explored this Fitness Peak for a while     
1:41:14     
and then go to the blue colored ones and mutate those and so you get concentric circles of blue I already kind of     
1:41:21     
explored that so I'm going to go to this WHL I'm going to explore that see if I     
1:41:28     
can okay there we go and I like this WHL and I'm going to look for this thing     
1:41:34     
which is kind of a mix of the two things I found before and you see the point is that     
1:41:39     
you're kind of exploring that part of the space you might move to a different part of the space um and then you know     
1:41:46     
you try to optimize this design now right now I'm not able to do this because I'm not really trying but I     
1:41:52     
could get to some really optimized version of this of these whls or I guess     
1:41:58     
in this case not really optimized it's just uh preference what do I find the most     
1:42:04     
beautiful so this was actually produced by The evolutionary complexity research group at     
1:42:11     
UCF I don't know what where this is based but UCF I think it is I don't know     
1:42:18     
yeah that that was that was where Kenneth Stanley was originally you know but in Central Florida oh okay yeah     
1:42:25     
that's for like that was his home institution like again like going back     
1:42:30     
to 200 yeah yeah or like yeah around there     
1:42:36     
yeah before we went to open AI I think they're defun now so it doesn't matter     
1:42:42     
but this is basically their demo so yeah all right yeah so that's that's uh     
1:42:50     
all I had to say about that go ahead well I just wanted to add something that     
1:42:55     
you know is not is not evolutionary um but was super     
1:43:01     
interesting also you know it was probably last week but the videos dropped or um just     
1:43:09     
just recently but um um Isaac Newton Institute and I I dropped some links to     
1:43:16     
this um was covering a lot of um like     
1:43:22     
interesting touring pattern kind of stuff and and related     
1:43:29     
um you know related algorithmic work where yeah that just that had a lot of     
1:43:36     
biological inspiration yeah a lot of biomimesis kind of stuff     
1:43:44     
um that that is is certainly really cool     
1:43:49     
yeah and I I I I let me just I forget if I I know think I dropped one thing in BIO     
1:43:58     
evolu yeah but     
1:44:03     
uh was it maybe maybe um yeah so I dropped something in     
1:44:10     
um I I gotta I gotta add some more links to this because it was actually really cool and I I I dropped something in     
1:44:17     
network science that was related to like theory of hypergraph stuff but there was another they were they were doing     
1:44:24     
another seminar program that was actually more like Turing pattern um     
1:44:29     
kind of stuff relating to you know how you get stripes on an animal kind of     
1:44:34     
stuff oh right that was the one in BIO Evolution that was yeah that that was the one that was kind of in BIO     
1:44:40     
Evolution but like like if you go if you go into their YouTube um like header or     
1:44:46     
description yeah like like at the bottom of the paragraph there's a link to the     
1:44:51     
um to the original you know to the whole program to the whole seminar Okay and like you can get all the speakers yeah     
1:44:58     
and like really cool interesting stuff yeah I I yeah the the pattern formation     
1:45:05     
using Quantum stuff is interesting I yeah go ahead so so it's interesting     
1:45:13     
right because it's like like from that name you might not know     
1:45:19     
what what you're getting yourself into yeah but but it actually is is a lot     
1:45:27     
about you know again it's it's about interesting mathematical structures for     
1:45:32     
for patent formation right because it's I think it was like like what what what I actually meant by that was like like     
1:45:40     
orthogonal pooms yeah yeah you know and     
1:45:45     
and what's interesting about that is um     
1:45:50     
that is actually very similar to a lot of this kopic     
1:45:58     
um connecto harmonic analysis that     
1:46:03     
um was kind of well Selen addoy like was     
1:46:08     
the first author on this stuff Morton Kringle back I think was like the last author on this stuff but it's a it's a     
1:46:14     
lot of very similar kind of stuff but but as applied to data analysis right     
1:46:22     
right as opposed to yeah so just just getting it um I mean certainly breaking     
1:46:29     
down uh resting state functional     
1:46:34     
Network into into similar kinds of DEC you know     
1:46:41     
similar spherical harmonic decompositions yeah so uh just saw     
1:46:48     
Jessie Jessie had something here I may have to go soon just recalling the Run     
1:46:54     
of Granville stuff from before I may have more fun cybernetics related things ahead about that ARA collaborator in     
1:47:01     
their projects yeah I saw that Jesse you had a thing on um what was the thing     
1:47:07     
that you were mentioning yeah and this     
1:47:12     
is it's not you know you guys were immediately talking about so I don't me     
1:47:18     
to interrupt that if you want to say more oh no go ahead you can go ahead I I just have something to say after but go     
1:47:24     
ahead um I not have a lot to say right now but     
1:47:33     
um I just basically remembered that in the context of you know we we kind of I I rambled a     
1:47:41     
lot earlier about cybernetics and chology and complexity stuff     
1:47:47     
um suffice to say there's another I'm not really I can't say too much about it     
1:47:53     
right now but but someone asked about about that and     
1:47:58     
I'm um I guess I wanted to say that that came up when we were going     
1:48:05     
through the references for the world modeling paper right is that where yeah     
1:48:10     
that's um and is that was that a general reference     
1:48:17     
or do we explicitly reference that in the paper like like I know part of the     
1:48:23     
reference is like B biblography at large but I don't remember if that's I wanted to ask a little bit more about it in the     
1:48:29     
comext of of that paper um but we don't have to discuss that now just yeah so I     
1:48:35     
mean like the the Granville paper we talked about blackboxes and white boxes like the idea being that black boxes are     
1:48:42     
unknown processes white boxes are where you know what's inside the Box the process and then the idea that Granville     
1:48:49     
had was that you if you have a black box and you figure out what's inside of it and it turns into a gray box or a white     
1:48:57     
box then you know it's transparent you know what processes so instead of having     
1:49:02     
like a stochastic process you have something that has a mechanism itself but his point was that even if you can     
1:49:09     
do that you still have new black boxes that pop up within them so you keep going it's kind of a reductionist     
1:49:16     
approach to breaking down a black box you do that and you still have black     
1:49:21     
boxes and you continually it's like black boxes all the way down basically     
1:49:26     
so that that was the thing and then it was cited in the paper as kind of like you know the things about cybernetics     
1:49:32     
where we have these boxes and arrows and you know the idea that there's this regulation and you know regulation how     
1:49:40     
much knowledge we have to have about what's inside the black box to really understand if something's well regulated     
1:49:46     
or not I think that's kind of the point of linking that to the paper um and then     
1:49:52     
so I mean I don't know if you were had like some uh someone who's interested in     
1:49:57     
that or something about Granville or what it     
1:50:03     
was um I'll probably say more later just because I don't I don't want to be too     
1:50:10     
unstructured and talking about it right now but um no that's good I'm going to go look at the paper again and and kind     
1:50:18     
of relate it back to what's going on and uh yeah it's kind of funny it feels like     
1:50:23     
this you know unplanned in the greatness cannot be planned since unplanned big     
1:50:28     
faret into like cybernetic related stuff over the last month or so um it's it's     
1:50:34     
kind of funny because it's not not what I was thinking here but then um a lot of fun stuff there so     
1:50:41     
yeah I I'll let it be for that and and I had to go soon but thank you for everything today oh yeah questions yeah     
1:50:48     
no problem um yeah so then I had one more comment on what what Morgan was talking about the quantum stuff for     
1:50:55     
pattern record or pattern formation reminds me of I've done this work and I I never published it I just kind of like     
1:51:02     
played with my food as it as it were um that is working on this thing with uh     
1:51:08     
kind of like interference patterns and pattern formation or like in in morphogenesis     
1:51:14     
specifically and other types of like you know overlapping sort of motifs that     
1:51:21     
kind of interfere it's something I have to write up and and I've been working in     
1:51:26     
for many years and I don't exactly know how to write it up but this is this idea that there's you could have like     
1:51:31     
chemical gradients that interact or you know something else there are some examples of this in nature where you can     
1:51:38     
have these overlapping patterns that form higher order patterns and things like     
1:51:43     
that I I think you'd like this seminar Series yeah yeah I'll take a look at it     
1:51:49     
yeah yeah awesome so you know in a lot of the embodied cognition we have had     
1:51:55     
discussions about like uh synergies and complexity Theory and a lot of the     
1:52:02     
examples that you have kind of relate to biomechanics but also do embodiment and     
1:52:09     
we've talked about uh like you know pre- nervous system filtering of     
1:52:14     
information and so we're going to talk about now it's kind of a mix of all those things we're going to talk about this area called     
1:52:21     
neuromechanics and we're going to talk about some biomechanical filtering some things about     
1:52:27     
synergies and some things about motor control and so it'll come together     
1:52:32     
hopefully so this is um a couple authors nille Hogan is a big name in motor     
1:52:40     
control and this paper is uh 2024 it's a     
1:52:46     
pre-print and bio archive uh this is uh on human motor     
1:52:51     
coordination the Synergy expansion hypothesis so this is a paper on motor     
1:52:57     
coordination and motor control uh but it's also bringing this idea of     
1:53:03     
synergies together with that and Synergy expansion specifically so uh this abstract talks     
1:53:11     
about Bernstein and we've talked about Bernstein before he's a early motor control     
1:53:16     
person um so the search for an answer to Bernstein's degrees of freedom problem     
1:53:22     
and the degrees of freedom problem is like you know you you know when you're uh trying to control your coord you know     
1:53:29     
coordinate your limb movements movements towards a Target you have a number of degrees of freedom and     
1:53:35     
the idea is are those degrees of freedom coupled or are they independent if they're independent then it's harder to     
1:53:41     
control than if they're coupled in someone so people have searched for an answer to this and of course we talked     
1:53:48     
about synergies as being the coordination of these degrees of freedom with with muscle groups with limb joint     
1:53:55     
coordination these s other sorts of things so this search has propelled a large portion of research studies and     
1:54:02     
human motor control over the past six decades uh different theories have been     
1:54:07     
developed to explain how humans might use their incredibly complex neuromuscular skeletal system with     
1:54:13     
astonishing ease so you know we do this sort of easy kind of we we make movements with these but it's a really     
1:54:20     
hard problem for the nerve system to solve you know you you have to have this     
1:54:26     
sort of multi-level coordination of muscle groups and joints and things like that     
1:54:33     
so you know we have to kind of think about how this might work among these theories motor synergies appeared as one     
1:54:40     
possible explanation so motor synergies are where you know you have muscle groups that are coordinated in their     
1:54:46     
activities or you have limbs that are coordinated and it constrains the kind of movement space that you can make so     
1:54:52     
you know if I if I coordinate myself to move and grab a cup on the table and     
1:54:58     
move it to my mouth that's a set of muscles that in my arms and in my torso     
1:55:05     
that need to be coordinated the brain needs to coordinate all that and the control problem is harder if they're not     
1:55:11     
coordinated into one unit but if they're coordinated into one unit it's a lot easier uh so motor synergies was     
1:55:19     
impossible explanation in this work the author is inv investigate the nature and role of synergies and propose a new     
1:55:25     
theoretical framework namely the expansion hypothesis to answer burnstein's problem the expansion     
1:55:32     
hypothesis is articulated in three propositions so the first is     
1:55:38     
mechanical the second is Developmental and the third is behavioral so you have kind of the the     
1:55:46     
whole sweep of motor the field of motor control you have sort of this mechanical aspect this     
1:55:52     
neuromechanics it's biomechanics uh aspect um and then you     
1:55:59     
have the developmental aspect which is you know petti and where you have this like motor motor control is an important     
1:56:06     
aspect of development so like you know if we coordinate ourselves to walk or coordinate our movements we're not     
1:56:12     
really born making these very uh refined movements you know babies movements are     
1:56:18     
very uh un uncoordinated so they need to be able to coordinate their movements     
1:56:23     
and this is kind of the other concern um and then behavioral of course because that's a behavioral     
1:56:30     
problem each proposition addresses a different question of the nature of synergies so the first is how many     
1:56:37     
synergies a human can have so you know how many synergies can you have can you have one Synergy or can you have     
1:56:43     
infinite synergies that kind of arise as you need them so like if I reach out and grab a cup and move it to my mouth     
1:56:49     
that's one Synergy if I'm like running rning down a soccer field and I uh do a cartwheel and I kick a ball do a goal     
1:56:57     
that's another set of synergies if I um you know I'm trying to fly a plane     
1:57:02     
that's another set of synergies if I'm playing the violin that's another set of synergies so how many can you have and     
1:57:09     
is there some sort of computational cost to that I guess uh two how can we learn     
1:57:15     
and develop synergies so how do we develop them how do we learn them are they learned if you're playing the     
1:57:21     
violin you're learning a set of coordin you're coordinating certain muscles those are you know you're training those     
1:57:28     
muscles you're training your nervous system to respond to that Synergy so you     
1:57:33     
you know you're not born knowing how to play the violin well you learn that Synergy and you develop it to become an     
1:57:39     
expert playing the violent how do we use synergies so you     
1:57:45     
know how do we coordinate them and Implement them uh do we use them for specific things and why okay so these     
1:57:53     
are the things that you know you can ask about synergies an example numeric simulation is presented and analyzed to     
1:57:59     
clarify the hypothesis propositions the expansion hypothesis is contextualized with respect to the     
1:58:06     
existing literature on motor synergies both in healthy and impaired individuals     
1:58:11     
so this is not only useful for looking at like how we do you know uh how sensory motor coordination works but     
1:58:18     
also if you're you know if you have impaired individuals if you have people with uh you know a lack of muscular     
1:58:26     
control for example or you know they had they're paralyzed they have like you     
1:58:31     
know they don't have a full function or range of motion in their arm muscles     
1:58:38     
those sorts of things those are important you know they're going to have different types of synergies sometimes they compensate for the loss of muscular     
1:58:45     
control or they compensate for you know they have uh compromised muscle activity     
1:58:53     
they can you know they have different synergies maybe for doing the same thing so it's an interesting way to look at     
1:58:58     
this as well as other prominent theories in human motor control and development     
1:59:03     
the expansion hypothesis provides a novel framework to better comprehend and explain the nature use and evolution of     
1:59:10     
human motor skills so this is where they kind of talk about uh the expansion     
1:59:17     
hypothesis uh where they Define motor synergies in the inter production as     
1:59:23     
coordinated activities of multiple features such as joints and muscles that simplify movement control so you're     
1:59:30     
trying to aim towards this fluid motion and coordinating all the substrate to do     
1:59:36     
that um and this is also useful for robotic control because in robotic control we're trying to coordinate a     
1:59:42     
large a potentially large number of degrees of freedom if we can constrain those degrees of     
1:59:48     
freedom so that you know some you know joints move with other joints in in     
1:59:54     
coordination then that can solve the computational load in terms of producing     
1:59:59     
smooth robotic movements     
2:00:05     
so uh let's see they kind of talk about uh synergies they talk about     
2:00:12     
defining the different components so they Define a motor task is any task requiring the temporal coordination of     
2:00:19     
multiple features which they Define is muscles and Joints so you know in     
2:00:25     
Synergy you're coordinating temporally muscles and joints and so the temporal     
2:00:31     
aspect is important because you have to have the timing right um so EX for example a motor task could be a reaching     
2:00:38     
grasp movement or the movement performance sing a golf club throwing a football or playing a musical instrument     
2:00:45     
such a motor task can be decomposed as a sequence of temporarily group motor     
2:00:50     
trunks so this this is interesting because a we've talked about sequence     
2:00:56     
learning in the context of artificial networks so sequence learning in uh you     
2:01:03     
know like large language models that can be a bottleneck to learning context we     
2:01:09     
talked about that we also talked about sequence there's a hypothesis where     
2:01:14     
people have reimagined uh spatial cognition as a sequence learning problem and so a     
2:01:20     
sequence learning problem just is where you have these like tokens or these uh     
2:01:26     
you know Primitives that are assembled in a sequence that uh you know the model     
2:01:31     
has to understand and has to be able to compare with other sequences so this kind of lends itself to the sort of     
2:01:37     
these different models these artificial models uh but also some things that we do we we often times receive things in     
2:01:45     
sequences and in time uh there's Al there also these motor chunks which actually build on what we know about     
2:01:52     
short-term memory what we know about like taking information in from the world like episodic memory or procedural     
2:01:59     
memory and associating them in a chunk so like you know motor chunk would be     
2:02:04     
like where if you had a lot of things that were related to one another that could be put into a category you would     
2:02:10     
do that in motor control it's a bit different because we're talking about procedural learning but basically it's     
2:02:16     
chunking procedural learning so this is also something that happens in time     
2:02:22     
so you know there there are these concepts related to cognitive processing     
2:02:28     
uh Lashley is a good resource for thinking about some of these early ideas uh D Jeron and cornes Sheva have     
2:02:37     
done some more recent work on this so this is where we have uh you     
2:02:43     
know they they what they're trying to do is build a model of motor chunks being     
2:02:48     
sort of the decomposition of a motor task which can be represented by a continuous     
2:02:54     
temporal Evolution so in piano playing or if you're tapping your fingers on a table a     
2:03:01     
motor chunk can represent a subsequence of the finger movements that have their own distinct temporal patterns so in     
2:03:07     
piano playing you're reaching out with your fingers to hit different Keys a motor trunk might be a movement towards     
2:03:13     
a certain key and then the idea is you can break this down into pieces and     
2:03:19     
understand the coordination that way uh each motor chunk can be in turn decomposed into a series of Elementary     
2:03:26     
actions representing the fundal atomic elements composing motion so these     
2:03:31     
Elementary actions are made of two distinct Parts Synergy composition which is Vector     
2:03:37     
wi that contains the information of the selection of each feature of the given motor action and then the temporal     
2:03:44     
Evolution which is UI T minus TI which represents the time trajectory of this     
2:03:49     
Synergy composition vector so they're taking these the the motor action     
2:03:55     
breaking it down into these chunks and then they're reconstructing it as this you know temporal Evolution so you have     
2:04:03     
you know information in each feature and then this temporal Evolution and then so     
2:04:09     
you know we can build a model that's formalized this way we also have this diagram that shows     
2:04:16     
sort of the hierarchical organization of motor planning so we have a motor test     
2:04:21     
which is sequence St we have these temporal groupings or these chunks we decompose a sequence we decompose each     
2:04:29     
chunk into Elementary actions for each Elementary action we have a Synergy     
2:04:34     
composition which is these matrices W and they describe this set of things     
2:04:41     
that are involved in the elementary action these set of Elementary actions define a chunk the chunks Define a     
2:04:48     
sequence and then so you can look at these uh tempor Evolutions so you can look at the evolution of synergy     
2:04:55     
compositions the evolution of temporal groupings and then motor tests in this     
2:05:00     
way where you have these distributions over time that kind of overlap and     
2:05:06     
that's kind of the idea here where you can look at the temporal Evolution trajectory as a series of synergy     
2:05:13     
compositions that overlap and produce these um output so if you're playing a piano you have finger movements the     
2:05:19     
finger movements have different components to them and you can look at those as they kind of are coordinated     
2:05:25     
together in time so this is an interesting paper     
2:05:31     
that kind of goes over this sort of idea of synergies and how they think about     
2:05:36     
you know development and uh you know active behavior and things like that the     
2:05:41     
second paper is on biomechanical filtering so we talked about I think     
2:05:46     
it's uh Adam saffron who proposed this idea of pre-filtering things an     
2:05:52     
embodiment and so it means that you have information maybe that's coming into the peripheral nervous system through joint     
2:05:59     
receptors or through you know proception and that's filtering information kind of at the level of the     
2:06:06     
spinal cord or in the peripheral nervous system before it gets to the brain so this is a very clear role for EMB body     
2:06:13     
now in this case what they're talking about is biomechanical filtering supporting tactile en coding efficiency     
2:06:19     
in the human hand so this is uh you know this is kind of a hardcore uh biomechanics paper this is a     
2:06:26     
bioarchive preprint from this year and so this kind of goes into some     
2:06:33     
you know biomechanical explicit aspects of this sort of idea of embodied filtering or     
2:06:41     
whatever you want to call it so the abstract reads touching an object elicit skin oscillations that are biochemically     
2:06:48     
trans or biomechanically transmitted throughout the hand driving responses in thousands of tactile receptors including     
2:06:55     
numerous exquisitely sensitive pacinian cor pusles accepted definitions of pum     
2:07:02     
cor pusles functionally characterize the response properties is highly stereotyped based on experimental data     
2:07:09     
gathered when stimuli are applied near the receptor so if I have my hand and I touch it with a feather I I brush a     
2:07:16     
feather across the hand surface that hand touching the hand surface like that that Lit skin     
2:07:23     
oscillations along the surface of the skin in the different sensor receptors     
2:07:28     
on the surface of the skin this is biome mechanically transmitted Across the Skin     
2:07:34     
So it provides some spatial information but it provide more importantly it provides a sort of uh intensity     
2:07:41     
information and so you can tell sometimes when you been touched by a feather versus touched by a pen because     
2:07:48     
of the pressure because of the sort of the SP facial information and so forth     
2:07:54     
so this is all information that comes from these receptors called patinum cor     
2:07:59     
pusles as well as other types of uh surface receptors on the     
2:08:06     
skin uh so this just kind of talks about you know the response properties of these     
2:08:11     
receptors uh and then they can get into that so there's this uh phenomena called     
2:08:18     
Natural Touch so however during natural touch so you can actually do this very     
2:08:24     
in a very um sort of mechanical way they do in the lab Natural Touch is where you     
2:08:30     
have this sort of you know where it's maybe like you know just naturally touching something as opposed to like     
2:08:37     
stimulating The receptors during natural touch spiking activity in the major majority of penan cor musles is evoked     
2:08:45     
by transmitted skin oscillations that are modified by biomechanical filtering     
2:08:51     
this fil filtering mechanism stemming from dispersive wave Dynamics in the skin Bears some similarity to the pre     
2:08:57     
neuronal filtering of auditory signals by the basilar membrane a mechanical     
2:09:04     
process that is instrumental to perception so this is where you know they're comparing proppr reception with     
2:09:11     
auditory filtering or auditory processing in the ear so you have this preal filtering auditory signals by this     
2:09:19     
basil membrane it's basic basically uh you know a component of the inner ear I     
2:09:25     
believe where it's basically filtering the frequencies and it's you know this     
2:09:30     
is before it's even an input to the to the brain to the nervous system and so     
2:09:36     
this is again something that we see in the surface of the skin when you engage in Natural Touch there are these     
2:09:43     
modifications to uh the skin and the way that this signal was processed before it     
2:09:49     
even gets to the nervous system um so thus we sought to clarify how skin biomechanics might influence tactile     
2:09:56     
information and coding in the periphery we used vibr Tri Imaging and computational neur uh neural experiments     
2:10:04     
to examine the influence of biomechanical filtering on neuroactivity and whole hand prum corus populations we     
2:10:12     
observe complex location and frequency dependent patterns of filtering that were shaped by tissue mechanics and hand     
2:10:19     
morphology so it's the the the sort of the nature of the skin the mechanics of     
2:10:24     
the skin uh and hand morphology so you know whatever wherever you put it on the     
2:10:30     
hand that that's you know uh morphology dependent depending on the nature of the     
2:10:37     
tissue uh and where you place the the stimulus on the hand that's also a     
2:10:43     
factor that very you know uh is variable the source of biomechanical     
2:10:48     
modulation Diversified patinan Cor pusle population spiking activity and enhance tactile information     
2:10:56     
and coding efficiency so depending on where the stimulus happens on the hand it's     
2:11:02     
dependent on these mechanics and morphology aspects but also this affects     
2:11:08     
the neuroactivity at The receptors and the information encoding     
2:11:14     
at The receptors so this tactile information encoding is more or less efficient depending on these other     
2:11:20     
factors these findings indicate that biomechanics furnishes a pre neuronal     
2:11:25     
mechanism that facilitates efficient tactile en coding and processing so this is a nice paper on     
2:11:32     
kind of goes over this model of biomechanical     
2:11:38     
filtering and so you know they kind of have some diagrams here where they have different contact locations if which     
2:11:46     
translate into different stimulus frequencies they show kind of the spatial resolution of the hand and you     
2:11:53     
know depending on where the stimulation occurs there different amplitudes of the signal all right so then the third paper     
2:12:01     
here is discovering individual specific gate signatures from data driven models     
2:12:07     
of neuromechanical Dynamics and this is a bioarchive preprint from     
2:12:13     
2023 and this will hopefully tie up the other two papers or tie together what     
2:12:19     
they they've talked about um and so Locomotion results from the     
2:12:25     
interactions highly nonlinear neural and biomechanical Dynamics accordingly     
2:12:32     
understanding gate Dynamics across behavioral conditions and individuals based on detailed modeling of the     
2:12:38     
underlying neuromechanical system is proven difficult so it's kind of like     
2:12:43     
you know we've done these detailed models we're trying to get a sense of gate Dynamics which is where you're     
2:12:48     
walking and you're trying to figure out the dynamics of footfall and the Dynamics of stride and things like that     
2:12:56     
um here we develop a data driven and generative modeling approach that recapitulates the dynamical features of     
2:13:03     
gate behaviors to enable more holistic and interpretable characterizations and comparisons of     
2:13:09     
gate Dynamics so they're using um the sort of generative modeling approach     
2:13:15     
they want to look at gate behaviors as these dynamical processes but having     
2:13:21     
different features that they can extract out and understand what they mean so uh     
2:13:28     
they want to basically characterize comparisons gate Dynamics across individuals across people with um you     
2:13:35     
know pathologies versus normal and so forth specifically gate dynamics of     
2:13:41     
multiple individuals are protected by a dynamical model that defines a common     
2:13:47     
low dimensional lat in space so this is again where we're doing the same kind of thing we did with     
2:13:53     
cppn we're generating this low dimensional or in that case it's a high dimensional l space perhaps but in this     
2:14:00     
case you're generating a l low dimensional lat in space and you know in the first paper they kind of didn't do     
2:14:07     
this but they did talk about muscle synergies if you wanted to find like you know the number of possible muscle     
2:14:13     
synergies you generate some sort of Laten space where you could sample from that Laten space and find different     
2:14:18     
muscle synergies that might be sort of used in different contexts so maybe that's what we have from the first paper     
2:14:25     
and then of course they doing something like this in this paper this is to compare group and individual differences     
2:14:31     
so you know group and individual differences all exist in this lat and space and you know essentially you can     
2:14:38     
draw like kind of solutions from that and compare it with what people are     
2:14:44     
doing we find that highly individualized Dynamics or gate signatures or healthy     
2:14:50     
older adults and stroke survivors are in treadmill walking so they're they put them on the treadmill they have them     
2:14:55     
walk they're able to look at like you know different populations in this case     
2:15:01     
they have healthy older individuals and stroke survivors they want to see you know what kind of individual Dynamics     
2:15:07     
they have often times again older adults and stroke survivors are compensating     
2:15:12     
when they have these synergies they moving they're often compensating for like some sort of uh you know disability     
2:15:19     
or something where they muscles aren't working maybe the same way they worked when they were healthier adults or in     
2:15:26     
normal popul so-called normal populations so they look at treadmill walking they see that treadmill walking     
2:15:33     
is conserved across gate speed gate signatures further reveal individual differences in Gate     
2:15:39     
Dynamics even in individuals of similar functional deficits moreover components     
2:15:45     
of gate signatures can be biomechanically interpreted and manipulated to reveal the relationship     
2:15:51     
to observe spatio temporal joint coordination patterns and this is basically our energies where we have     
2:15:58     
these joint coordination patterns in space and time so we have temporal coordination we have these uh you know     
2:16:05     
motor trunks that are coordinated we also have things that are spatially uh coordinated so if you have like you know     
2:16:13     
things in your upper leg things in your lower leg things in your hip that are all coordinated     
2:16:19     
together lastly the gate D Dynamics model can predict the time evolution of joint coordination based on an initial     
2:16:25     
static posture so you start by standing still and then you know you get the     
2:16:31     
sense of what muscle groups are you know weak or strong where you're starting from and then it can predict kind of     
2:16:40     
joint the sort of synergies from that and how those synergies evolve over time again we're doing this from a latent     
2:16:46     
space we're not doing this from I mean we're using data to generate the slate     
2:16:51     
in space and then we can generate things from the weate in space to predict things from a static posture so you know     
2:16:57     
kind of where your stting point is and you can predict out from there our gate signatures framework thus provides a     
2:17:04     
generalizable listic method for characterizing and predicting cyclic     
2:17:09     
dynamical motor behavior that may generalize across species pathologies and     
2:17:15     
gate so that's uh a set of papers on     
2:17:21     
neuromechanics and synergies and complexity at the level of motor control     
2:17:27     
and then looking at like how they're using generative techniques to sort of generate these sort of synergies and     
2:17:34     
predict things from them yeah     
2:17:40     
um uh do you mind bringing up that first paper real yeah see uh     
2:17:49     
um like syy hypothesis yeah yeah so um if you can     
2:17:58     
blow it up for my my old     
2:18:04     
eyes yeah yeah yeah and um scroll down a bit you just wanted to I think I saw     
2:18:12     
something in terms of what they were doing uh to oh yeah sorry stop there go     
2:18:20     
up yeah up a bit in the equation no yeah keep going yeah above     
2:18:27     
the above that equation right okay the above above the syry yeah yeah so I just     
2:18:34     
wanted to get at yeah right there okay yeah yeah so the current mathematical methods to extract     
2:18:40     
synergies are based on Factor Matrix factorization techniques yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay     
2:18:48     
okay okay yeah I mean sure like like I guess is the theme here     
2:18:55     
you know find finding that lower dimensional space right right and     
2:19:01     
and my my um basic super simple search trying to find     
2:19:08     
that paper I found this 2010 paper that they were talking about kind of like     
2:19:15     
again like finding finding the low dimensional manifold right     
2:19:21     
and um um and yeah just     
2:19:29     
just you know this is this is what you you get when you you know have these     
2:19:36     
kind of rigid bodies connected um where it it's like like     
2:19:41     
there's lots of moving Parts but because of their connectivity um they're they're actually     
2:19:47     
much more much fewer degrees of freedom than you think um and yeah it's it's it's it's     
2:19:57     
really interesting I mean um how that relates     
2:20:04     
to EG analysis as well really oh like block     
2:20:09     
models you again like like that it's it's much lower dimensional than you     
2:20:15     
think right you know like like it looks it looks um     
2:20:21     
yeah um and how you know again these these these     
2:20:27     
Matrix factorizations are so important because they they really     
2:20:34     
uncover that and and again like you know been doing some stuff recently just in     
2:20:41     
terms of how how how best to find that that     
2:20:47     
complex or that that low dimensional like what's what's the correct number of Dimensions yeah yeah right because if     
2:20:55     
you can if you can yeah you know and and     
2:21:00     
certainly like variance explained sometimes doesn't doesn't do it just like you need you need a little bit more     
2:21:08     
subtlety in terms of finding that that correct um much lower dimensional space     
2:21:15     
yeah like like you know and um and then the interesting things that happen when     
2:21:22     
you know you you you're starting with like say 64 you're you're getting something     
2:21:30     
where it's like 30 explains all the variants but you can actually find a representation in eight dimensions and     
2:21:38     
like what happens with with that much more compact one     
2:21:44     
um it's it's really interesting the gates um the um     
2:21:51     
so the piano playing is really interesting um because of you know it's     
2:21:57     
also the the links or at least the the discussion William James had about it in     
2:22:03     
terms of like both motor chunking as well as just speed of of     
2:22:10     
execution um and Source the neural source of like like the conduction time     
2:22:16     
and things like that right but but um uh a lot of groups use gate analysis for um     
2:22:23     
dementia prediction like like it's really interesting all the other pathologies that that creates a     
2:22:32     
detectable gate change right um is is you     
2:22:38     
know I mean you know there's there the they were they were including stroke     
2:22:45     
but you can certainly see this with like the obvious ones being like you know     
2:22:51     
uh um Ms and Parkinson's um where there's there's like literally these     
2:22:57     
motor aspects um but uh but I thought I thought dementia is really interesting     
2:23:03     
because you don't think about it as as being that kind of issue but um     
2:23:09     
uh but it really does have all these kind of systemwide effects that that come out and     
2:23:16     
and potentially it relates to this kind of breakdown of of chunking and and     
2:23:26     
um the these General mechanisms that the brain is using you know yeah like like     
2:23:34     
you're seeing here yeah anyway super interesting I look forward to the actual     
2:23:41     
links yeah all right I think that's it for     
2:23:47     
this week thank you for attending and we'll follow follow up on the active inference stuff uh later yeah for sure     
2:23:54     
all right thanks take care take care bye

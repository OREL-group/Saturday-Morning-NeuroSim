## NOTES
More direct path ‚Äî> conversation with Avery. Synthetic data, Plot Twisters.

MESA ‚Äî setting up, sugar and spice trader models. Clean coding, good practice.

Ajad Ismail: active matter, systems biology.

Paola DiMaio: model cards for ML, natural language for machine models. ML for model cards, LLMS (use natural language interface).

* queries rely upon data structures.

Moonshot: intelligence definition ‚Äî path to AGI, Neural MMO. Moonshot: need to have ‚Äúa moon‚Äù, ‚Äúway to get there‚Äù defined, otherwise not useful.

* developing an interactive XR prototype for C. elegans connectome exploration.

* VR fully immersive environment.

_C. elegans_ ‚Äîmodel organism ‚Äî used to investigate disease, gene function.

* blender, Unity modeling:

* blender ‚Äî> Unity ‚Äî> Paraview ‚Äî> SDKs ‚Äî> A-Frame ‚Äî> ABM-U.


ABM-U (Unity: https://github.com/cheliotk/unity_abm_framework

* components: 1) interactive 3-D model, 2) deployment on a widely-available XR platform, 3) open-source application.


SMN ‚Äî #braitenberg-vehicles. ROS ‚Äî Robotics Developer Masterclass.

* learning structured world models from and for physical interactions.

Michigan Mars rover team. DARPA challenge (robotics club). From grand challenge to undergrad project.

* multi-agents: ABMs, Deep RL, game theory, emergent complexity.

* can LLMs reason and plan? LLMS as agents.


Agent Zero: each agent has an interior model (cognitive,  intelligent).

* SFI course ‚Äî ABMs. Interesting confluence towards ABMs.

* area of computer simulation with a theoretical impact ‚Äî why the toy models? Synthetic data ‚Äî cannot collect data easily.

* AI curves: Mass General. Future of AI in medicine. Clinical AI ‚Äî rehab medicine.

* priorities, not theory. 

* incentives for investing in AI. Return on investment (ROI).

* generative AI ‚Äî> visualize development of diseases.


Dan Elton ‚Äî Microsoft New England ‚Äî future forecasting.

Mind First foundation. Psychohistory. Control over Ai technology.

* frontier mapping attempts. Destination spaces (trajectory approach).

* interpretational tools, long-term vision. Forced, voluntary tasks ‚Äî brain activation differences.

* cell types question ‚Äî Allen Institute Atlas (Voytek group, cell types given activity).

* naturalistic behavior,, given the state of the organism.


Open-source LLMs. BrainGPT ‚Äî using LLM, foundation model, Neuroscience data.

* discovery of papers, the ‚Äúliterature‚Äù.


MESA: Python framework for ABMs.

* Padraig ‚Äî OpenBrain ‚Äî> runs in the browser. NeuroFedora.

* micro-tension: collecting data, developmental modeling (generative aspects). ICDL conference.

* data ethics, model things that are hard to collect.

* useful simulations ‚Äî how to create, how to inform collective, emergent phenomena. 


Synthetic Data: fMRI useful for testing segmentation tools.

* Bzdok ‚Äî diversity-first model of Psychiatric Neuroimaging.

* Cellular Potts Models (Glazier) ‚Äî> Spatial-omics. 

* morpheus group (Dresden) ‚Äî computational epidemiology. Reduced-order model ‚Äî PDE discussion. Few things you are actually measuring.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction


Visualizable table (3k x 1k of cell type information data).

* we have the data, not the synthesis.

* need a superhuman aspect of organization (data located in multiple silos).

* what drove responses in a structural way? Snapshots don‚Äôt get at dynamism. EMBL, bio models.

can I suggest we paste the intersting  links in the slack, otherwise the pointers to valuable resources may be lost when the chat closes 
10:24

Morgan Hough
Morgan Hough says:
Yes good idea 
10:24

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
yes, that's usually what we do. Feel free to share links in slack

Should we have time this week, I may talk about: AI Cures 2024, "future of humanity" AI Futures event, Anthropic & future job postings <> data ethics . We may not have time for this directly, and I want to write a bit more about all of these things and present more formally on them ahead .

üëç  Jes (not sure how to give thumbs up directly under yr msg) 
paola says:
@morgan yes it is important imho to keep in mind that we are trying to answer urgent questions, absolutely, get to the gist and do not get lost in the complexity

yup

Sarrah Bastawala says:
Will have to leave, great meet, will definitely look more into the agent-based model with data paper looks interesting!

Thank you !

paola
paola says:
üëç 
paola says:
Thanks Bradlley, so what do we learn from the high density molecular data, about the diversity of the types of molecules? 
paola says:
@morgan so important understanding the chemistry of consciousness, if we could get into that 
paola says:
aw @brad I understand, thank you 
paola says:
yes, well, they call responsive a state of being conscious vs being unconscious (unresponsive) to the point about anestetized /asleep specimen,

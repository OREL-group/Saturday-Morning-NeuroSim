## Notes
Bioquest -- edu foundation (disseminated materials).

Lucina Uddin: paper on resting state (Nature).

Morgan: Open Science in undergrad education.

* Neurobiology was strongly represented.

* theory of education people (Superlecturers).

* connecting science to civics.


Protocol Labs Neuro. An extension of Mind In Vitro project.

* Ashley Juavinett (Python for science).

* research opportunities for students that don't have those, liberal arts schools.

* 3-D bioprinting workshop (Bioelectric Structures).

* Open-source MEA = Open Ephys + Nanofab.


Full headset --> brain age prediction (AI).

* artificial skin uses layers. Mechanics, sensory cells.

* Human Brain Mapping (Brisbane) --> Neurodesk workshop.

* Enigma toolbox. 


Anthrobots: not super advanced from microscopy standpoint, micromanipulation skills
to do cellular rearrangements.

* organoids --> intelligence --> natural tissue types (not computational).

* non-natural targets towards goal.

Q: why can't I choose to grow arm with big hands? Anatomical Compiler (tissue types that match
technological interface).

* self-organizing. Cellular rearrangements --> changes in self-organization. Zen Gartner.

* configurational entropy. How would you do the modeling (Anthrobots --> CC3D).

* does deposition encourage anisotropy. Electrify medium --> 


Collective Intelligence Project (cip.org) challenge.

* develop new models (AI, mixed reality). Progress, Participation, Safety.

* most existing approaches, pick only two.

* negative effects of poor decisions compounded.


Recommendation system for products --> ekkolapto --> origins of intelligence, qualia, and 
consciousness. Augmentation lab.

* professional development realm. From Here to There.

* clunky does not equal bureaucracy. Why do deciders not decide?


Orientation towards specific outcomes = big risk.

* path-selection is divisive by nature.

* decisions have to contextualized be made enduring.

* organizational clinical therapy.


Real work of decision-making --> communicating changes.

* "strong bias for action" --> must also involved strong decision-making processes.

* durable decisions, leadership capital.

* momentum discussion. Collective effort of creation.

* separating decision-making from creative work.

did you guys wanna talk about this? 

Just discovered this: The Collective Intelligence Project has launched Global Dialogues - a platform to bring the world‚Äôs voices into the development and governance of AI. We‚Äôve built a global infrastructure to collect, process, and amplify diverse public input, and our dataset will always be open-source for anyone to build on.
 Submissions due July 11th. $10,000 prize fund will be distributed across top submissions.

hi, Vidhi here
im contributing to the OREL project this year in Open Source Community Stability
i was going through your project and found it pretty good
if you have maintained any weekly blogs can you please send them across or something
it'll be helpful
thank you :))

CIP ideas

two VR/EdTech concepts that feel really aligned with my work and could tie into both our internal R&D and broader conversations around collective intelligence (CIP, RadicalXChange, etc.). Would love to hear your thoughts and see if anyone‚Äôs interested in exploring one or both:
1. STEAM World-Builder + Quadratic Funding:
A collaborative VR game where students build a futuristic city (think SimCity/Minecraft) and allocate resources to public goods (schools, labs, etc.) using quadratic funding. It‚Äôs an interactive way to teach civic engagement, economics, and systems thinking.
2. XR School Policy Simulator:
A VR governance platform for civic ed or school boards where participants simulate policies (AI in classrooms, budget tradeoffs, mental health programs), vote via liquid democracy/QF, and watch the impact unfold through time-lapse simulations.
Both have strong potential as immersive learning tools + real-world CI testbeds. I‚Äôd be excited to scope one out as an MVP. Let me know which one speaks to you or if you‚Äôd like to brainstorm together this week.

## NOTES:
Newsletters? What to do in the new year.


Blue Brain retrospective:

20th anniversary: lots of outputs, successes?

what role does NeurotechX have in terms of education/training?

video courses, other sets of funding of interactions.

extension of projects past original.


EBRAINS research infrastructure — new iteration, less emphasis on Neurorobotics, Neuromorphic computing (beyond brain imaging, modeling).


Informal STEM learning grant. INCF — community-building (platforms for people).

Neuropixels workshop (UCL).

comprehensive education from curated resources.

tools integrated into other people’s work.


Open-source software being more than “up on Github” —> getting regular adopters (collect metrics).


Incentives around publications and peer review. Infinite publishing space (now the constraint is attention).

quality control vs. gatekeeping.

when is publication evaluatable”?

what’s good for fostering multidisciplinary collaborators (get activation energy)?

Konrad Kording — moving into new areas. 


Tim Behrens — brain areas doled out to PIs.

finding, establishment in an area — papers you need to read.

attentional blinders needed, but also constraint.

dissemination —> gatekeeping, be in the right e-mail groups.


Same meeting —> same papers.

who is your real audience (lack of analytics)?

how do you serve them?


Neurostars —> how-to, debugging level of education.

digging into EBRAINS - Blue Brain.

main tutorials — SciKitLearn. Work in the real-world vs. SOTA —> getting to know your dataset (different set of tools vs, PyTorch).

where’s the on-ramp? #pedagogy —> DISCORD backup.

“Core Equation of Neuroscience”. alphaXiv —> narrow down on a small set of papers —> springboard for new research.


Embodiment in populations, embodiment, genomes, and functions (structures) in populations.

Bongard, Morphological Computation. Bongard and Beer.

not easy to do armchair philosophy about.

Embodied, multiscale simulations. Anthrobots —> brittle way of making things vs agential matter.


We like networks of neurons, not neurons per se, but all cells do this.

form collective phenotypes. Goals, reach goals.

Neurofedora — insight toolkit.

software kit for M=edical Engineering, Kitware.

National Library of Medicine, segmentation, C++ based, software engineering.

CMAKE, Automake. Built on Windows, Macintosh, Linux int toolkit. its, vtk.

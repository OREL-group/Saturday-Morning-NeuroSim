## NOTES
Jesse: seasons are changing. Improve structure and functioning in lab.

* writin a draft. Three interesting things: 1) physical memory, 2) medium for agency (e.g. trauma), 3) emergence and computation (Amanda's definitions).

* Malabou's take on plasticity. NeuroTech is memory-related. 

* trying to model software, open-source ecosystems. Defining terms. 

* P300 is a surprise detector. Ooh! signal (not language centers or mind reading).

* assistive technologies. 


MuJoCo -- Todorov -- robots, about legged action and friction.

* modeling wing interactions rather than surface interactions.

* #bio-evolution --> dragonfly evolution.

* not using Flywire AI -- odn't need connectome data.

* Sim2Real acceleration (Physics Model). Geometry put together (Natural History collection).

* 1400 hi-res scans. Interesting to see which elements are needed in their model (Real2Sim, Sim2Real).


Josh Bongard --> disembodied heads.

* do Sims, sometimes it works in the transition to real. 3D print, could you make something that flies?

* what are the points of failure? Material and size scaling are what matters -- phenotypes can get smaller or larger and still behave similarly. Genetic mutants can reveal failure modes as well.


Human-in-the-loop RL: Georgia Tech. Watching Pac-Man, tell players when they make a mistake.

* different types of process in different biological systems. This thing does this other thing.

* think about processes -- extended synthesis -- a set of edge cases, differentiation from a theory.

* Kuhnian implications of buildup of edge cases.


Why did society, ethics, and technology team happen? Distributed aspects of research.

re: the cybernetic rg - i made a notion page for a "mission statement" that could use some filling in

awesome! I definitely will look at that esp later today.

Like bradly said the paper is a great first step andwould help direct focus on things moving forward

Morgan talking about eye gaze reminded me, had also attended a research symposium last week, and one of the papers presented there was : 
https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.764.pdf
 It talks about using  human eye-gaze patterns to detect hallucinations in LLMs based on the attention baiases employed by humans when asked to read a passage, and the authors also propose a annotated eye tracking corpus (IITB-HGC: IITB Hallucination Gaze corpus). Anybody interested could definitly check it out !

Jes says:
one thing i'd like to mention before we break, about practice-based research, and some interest in looking more at this (sort of, Education Banner type stuff)

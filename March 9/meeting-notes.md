## NOTES
CDEV SMB talk -- EI Workshop talk.

* Cultural Evolution Society abstract.

* Alife paper (due April 3). More generally....

* training and education -- mentorship, streamline processes for GSoC and onboarding.


Alex Higuera: Boston, networking event. What's involved in becoming a chapter, how to grow community!

* Paris, NeuroTechX (hosted @ CogLab).

* NeuroFedora. Participates in outreach-type things.

* Flock to Fedora (this year in Rochester, NY): https://flocktofedora.org/, https://fedoramagazine.org/get-ready-to-flock-to-fedora/

* tap people from conference and ask them about their experience.

* open-soure sustainability project --> NeuroFedora --> release engineering.

* assess utility, sustainability. Girard -- Wolfram Physics.

* Levin and x will host an ActInf live stream.

* LLM-powered multiagent framework.

* conditions for sustainable practice. Algorithmic backends. LLMs --> ChatGPT --> agents (perception and interaction).


Interface, Internal Mechanism, Action. Interact with real-world tools, LLM agents (instance).

* prompt, specialized activity (open-source contributor).

* LLM, only have access to pre-trained info --> add in access to real-world.

* LLM agent --> perception, action components. Real-time information observed, consult mental models (network), take actions.

* pre-trained information --> social network dynamics (S3), cooperative task solving (ChatDev), humanoid agents and emergent behaviors (Minecraft in AgentVerse). 


Rules for emotional response LLM agent roles in Minecraft (how are agents collaborating?). 

* AI economist project -- Salesforce (model of taxation). Agents, Plugins, Connections, Messages (trade-offs).

* map to a multi-agent system, pre-defined or rule-based (norms, etc).

* MetaGPT, AgentVerse, Generative and Humanoid Agents. Interact with Github and Slack.


OpenAI function -- calling, tokens via API. Prompt APIs in natural language.

* JSON format, use it for unique purposes and other purposes. Unique modeling, task of software engineering?

* NeuralMMO -- multi-agent RL (open-source sustainability).

* optimal conditions for paying avoiding taxes (social modeling problem). Humanoid agents paper (power through work vs. taking a nap --> basic needs and emotions).

* participation as a benefit, getting mentorship, why do things within a community happen?

* modeling as a focus on things. Collaborative interactions vs. code output. Eacch agent generating code (different priorities).

* "programmatically-generated everything". Sustainability means: retention? coding? communication? Smart agent that can write code.

* how is LLM agent processing environment? More RL? Mimic agent in a particular setting. 2x layer or multi-agent dynamics.


RedHat Bugzilla: tracking system by number for bugs in database. Trackign by number (Mozilla project). Not developing in isolation (sustainable work in a larger community).

* Neurreality -- physiological signals in the Metaverse.

* American Society for Cybernetics -- March 17 deadline.

* Deheane "Models of Human Learning and Cognition". Lisa Fagenson.

* causality, workshop -- UCSD. 

* Biwei Huang -- causal discovery and inference.

* DISI: human, non-human, machine, storytelling aspect. Many Minds podcast.

* discussion on how move away from virtual conferences are incompatible with DEI. Also climate and interactivity concerns.


Data release of CryoEM from CZI. Segmentation challenge.

* Yuri Manov -- hearing loss and mechanics. Connections between unorganized machines (boolean networks) and Gene Regulatory Networks.

"Interoception as modeling, allostasis as control" 
Amanda Nelson says:
"Abstract
The brain regulates the body by anticipating its needs and attempting to meet them before they arise ‚Äì a process called allostasis. Allostasis requires a model of the changing sensory conditions within the body, a process called interoception. In this paper, we examine how interoception may provide performance feedback for allostasis. We suggest studying allostasis in terms of control theory, reviewing control theory‚Äôs applications to related issues in physiology, motor control, and decision making. We synthesize these by relating them to the important properties of allostatic regulation as a control problem. We then sketch a novel formalism for how the brain might perform allostatic control of the viscera by analogy to skeletomotor control, including a mathematical view on how interoception acts as performance feedback for allostasis. Finally, we suggest ways to test implications of our hypotheses."

not a big update from my side, just focusing on academia for a while and excited for GSoC!

and sustainability beyond simply 'retention' or 'people working on the project'; I have wondered some about useful or improved archival or future-accessibility

Great paper. Another paper i would like to share is 
https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/emergent-bartering-behaviour-in-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/

I had taken inspiration from this during my early multi agent settings

Jes
Jes says:
good to have you here vrushali - much of the meeting has been about gsoc so far yes 
Jes says:
nice paper 
Jes says:
Josh Tenenbaum at MIT has done some similar interesting multiagent work, their paper was about chefs and making things in a kitchen environment

## NOTES
NetLogo. Work on visualization of the parameters changing. Look into NetLogo vs. MESA, PyGame.

* details of 12-week timeline.

Sarrah Bastawala ‚Äî worked on GNU Octave, ODE solver packages.

* LingBuzz ‚Äî LLMs brought a lot of new voices into computational linguistics.


Cybernetics RG ‚Äî Naturalizing Relevance Realization.

* mission statement ‚Äî Notion page. Memory as a case study (key people, 4E account of process).

* storage metaphor (storage, but too metaphoric RE: file cabinet problem.

* language paper raises a whole bunch of questions RE: computational linguistics, LLMs, translation.


Neuroethology: started with internal drives, inputs to an already active system. Near is building out an internal regulatory system, anatomy-agnostic.

* DS1, DS2 are multiple systems interlinked.

* paper: Framework for Studying Emotions Across Species (Cell).


Friston ‚Äî variational ecology. Allows for multi scale action.

Andy Clark‚Äôs Royal Institution talk. Dark Room problem, goes back to 2012. 1) Representation Wars: enacting an Armistice Through Active Inference (2020), 2) Friston,, Clark, Cisek, Parr, Pezzulo (2024).

* creativity ‚Äî something you have not seen before.

* Ken Stanley ‚Äî early work, image generation tool (PicBreeder?) Picbreeder platform ‚Äî composition and generative process from prompts or primitives, selection for what looks interesting. Compositional, open-ended.

* Ryan Smith ‚Äî recent ActInf presentation (connections between ActInf and RL).


World model ‚Äî last sentence of Paragraph 2: in First, Clark paper ‚Äî Bayesian state regulation over long time-scales.

* world generation is key to an agent‚Äôs ability to generalize. Come up with good input vectors.

* changes in state ‚Äî agent learning literature.

* reminiscent of NeuroTechX ‚Äî focus on sleeping and learning literature. Don‚Äôt know exactly why we dream.

potential anomaly  Entish (LOTR) 
Jes (OREL) says:
I probably won't be able to talk much at the moment either unforutnately 
10:06

Sarrah Bastawala
Sarrah Bastawala says:
I wonder if the findings from the paper could somehow impact the way language translation using deep learning works, or maybe the finding and the rates being similar is the reason it works 
10:07

Morgan Hough (he/him)
Morgan Hough (he/him) says:
Yes it raises many more questions 
10:10

i have to go - great papers this week. talk to you soon

Sarrah Bastawala
Sarrah Bastawala says:
@Bradley yes, language translation is mostly done with transformers using encoder decoder architectures, the use of encodings in it is what made me curious about this aspect as translation works a lot based on the encodings or embeddings of sentences in both the languages being similar from an extremely condensed perspective, where the I assume the different rates from the would matter, and maybe it can be used to understand how efficient translation would be. 
Sarrah Bastawala says:
will have to leave, really interesting meet and papers today !

Believable proxies for human behavior. Reflects on conversations (memory structure).

* basic memories and retrieval. Done in a town of 25 agents with a common language.

* memory stream (storage, GPT-4), 128k context length.

* retrieval (moment to moment behavior). Reflection, planning.

Smallville is a sprite-based sandbox.

* json files for agent profiles (persona).

* language models --> action --> emojis.

* state transferred into natural language. Routine --> agent interacts with other agents.

* coordinating joint activities (emergent phenomenon).

Choose to share information or not, store information or not.

* remember interactions. Social behaviors, rituals, sharing information.

* capacity --> forgetting. Memory stream with events.

Retrieval = Recency + Importance + Relevance

* stored as embeddings -- prompts has high weights for all 3 criteria.

* memory is linear -- decay factor over time.


Plan -- schedule events in future, influence output of LLMs.

* conditioned output, future tense.

* LLM can update the plan. Structured world environments, to natural language.

* Plans --> Reactions --> Reflections

* humanoid agents -- systems thinking.

* time-weighted vector store retriever. LangChain.


Multi-agent RL -- not a lot of believable agent literature. 

* 1) system prompt (think like a person), 2) user prompt (current).

* comparative testings of similar structure of agents.


Query 100 most recent records in memory stream.

* reflection, store in memory stream (sequential). Query reflection as well. 

Local audience for DMs, posts

* D&D campaign. Inside-out language, open-ended structures. Chunks of an agent's daily plan.

* how much planning? Yann LeCun's six components (what are these?)

* Winter School on Cognitive Models.


#research-management channel. Conceptual things -- 1) mentoring, 2) arrange conferences, 3) academia issues (education banner).

* tutorials: how to do things. Research management: expertise uncovers areas new to less experienced people.

* Slack channels require people to be deep in the narrative. Diffusive, not consolidative. Research management will consolidate, build out.

* "doing a chunk", "what are the standards" -- act to consolidate.

* hidden back-end to channels --> Demo or Die. Creation of artifacts.

* Project started --> assign roles, weekly updates. Very Agile-like (slackbot).

* idea --> discussion channel --> artifact (progress). List of active projects and people.

Reflect upon: randomness is physical -- interpretation is not.

* coin flip, basketball shot: lots of physical influences.

* will randomness go down with enbodiment? Control for randomness -- phenomena that are random (truly) --> does random really exist? Or does the ability to detect randomness?

* cognitive biases, gambling opn streaks (local sequence information).

* RL professor -- Alan Neuringer. RL of random sequences. Information-theoretic analysis of button presses. People cannot replicate truly random sequences.

* reinforcing deterministic, but can you reinforce randomness?

* Neuroimaging (spatial), multiple comparison correction. Clusters are not expected under randdomness (but do).

Ways of speaking about probabilities -- skill level, performance. Skill level (shooting a basketball, above average -- coin flips -- different length scales of streaks.

* don't have great ways of talking about statistical observations. Different analyses, different answers. Interpretive vs. generative. 


Are there too many variables? Is probability authoritative? 

* Randomness: what can we comprehend?

Hello everyone, what is the event Jes is talking about?

Jesse Parent
Jesse Parent says:
so this base description in initial memory is inserted into all of the prompts? and then updated it seems over time 
Jesse Parent says:
choosing to share information or not, mm 
Jesse Parent says:
which is a probability ? 
Jesse Parent says:
so retrival has "reflections" which are synthesis of various observations that (the agent?) has been exposed to 
Jesse Parent says:
I'd be curious about giving LLMs personality features and also doing a version of this that is essentially a DnD campaign also with motivations and narratives as well.

yeah, worked thanks, I ll drop  off . I ll see you on slack. very interesting topic Bradly. has a lot to do with chaoes theory from what I see.randomness, probability, deep myseteries of our universe

Jesse Parent
Jesse Parent says:
hot hand seems to have an uncomfortable realtionshpi with emobdiment and environment as well ; and perhaps strained assocaitions or anthropomorphism around sampling / sequences, randomness yes, and also the nature or acutal perspective of how a slection process is done 
Jesse Parent says:
The uncomfortability of , for a human being with general human perception and force control and evnironmental control, the outcome is sort of forced into this simplistic binary that is relatively at the range of 50%

thre are too manny variables

but I  like to ague that randomness may not quite be what it is made out to be. we need to work on understanding randomness,

Believable proxies for human behavior. Reflects on conversations (memory structure).

* basic memories and retrieval. Done in a town of 25 agents with a common language.

* memory stream (storage, GPT-4), 128k context length.

* retrieval (moment to moment behavior). Reflection, planning.

Smallville is a sprite-based sandbox.

* json files for agent profiles (persona).

* language models --> action --> emojis.

* state transferred into natural language. Routine --> agent interacts with other agents.

* coordinating joint activities (emergent phenomenon).

Choose to share information or not, store information or not.

* remember interactions. Social behaviors, rituals, sharing information.

* capacity --> forgetting. Memory stream with events.

Retrieval = Recency + Importance + Relevance

* stored as embeddings -- prompts has high weights for all 3 criteria.

* memory is linear -- decay factor over time.


Plan -- schedule events in future, influence output of LLMs.

* conditioned output, future tense.

* LLM can update the plan. Structured world environments, to natural language.

* Plans --> Reactions --> Reflections

* humanoid agents -- systems thinking.

* time-weighted vector store retriever. LangChain.


Multi-agent RL -- not a lot of believable agent literature. 

* 1) system prompt (think like a person), 2) user prompt (current).

* comparative testings of similar structure of agents.


Query 100 most recent records in memory stream.

* reflection, store in memory stream (sequential). Query reflection as well. 

Local audience for DMs, posts

* D&D campaign. Inside-out language, open-ended structures. Chunks of an agent's daily plan.

* how much planning? Yann LeCun's six components (what are these?)

* Winter School on Cognitive Models.


#research-management channel. Conceptual things -- 1) mentoring, 2) arrange conferences, 3) academia issues (education banner).

* tutorials: how to do things. Research management: expertise uncovers areas new to less experienced people.

* Slack channels require people to be deep in the narrative. Diffusive, not consolidative. Research management will consolidate, build out.

* "doing a chunk", "what are the standards" -- act to consolidate.

* hidden back-end to channels --> Demo or Die. Creation of artifacts.

* Project started --> assign roles, weekly updates. Very Agile-like (slackbot).

* idea --> discussion channel --> artifact (progress). List of active projects and people.

Reflect upon: randomness is physical -- interpretation is not.

* coin flip, basketball shot: lots of physical influences.

* will randomness go down with enbodiment? Control for randomness -- phenomena that are random (truly) --> does random really exist? Or does the ability to detect randomness?

* cognitive biases, gambling opn streaks (local sequence information).

* RL professor -- Alan Neuringer. RL of random sequences. Information-theoretic analysis of button presses. People cannot replicate truly random sequences.

* reinforcing deterministic, but can you reinforce randomness?

* Neuroimaging (spatial), multiple comparison correction. Clusters are not expected under randdomness (but do).

Ways of speaking about probabilities -- skill level, performance. Skill level (shooting a basketball, above average -- coin flips -- different length scales of streaks.

* don't have great ways of talking about statistical observations. Different analyses, different answers. Interpretive vs. generative. 


Are there too many variables? Is probability authoritative? 

* Randomness: what can we comprehend?

Hello everyone, what is the event Jes is talking about?

Jesse Parent
Jesse Parent says:
so this base description in initial memory is inserted into all of the prompts? and then updated it seems over time 
Jesse Parent says:
choosing to share information or not, mm 
Jesse Parent says:
which is a probability ? 
Jesse Parent says:
so retrival has "reflections" which are synthesis of various observations that (the agent?) has been exposed to 
Jesse Parent says:
I'd be curious about giving LLMs personality features and also doing a version of this that is essentially a DnD campaign also with motivations and narratives as well.

yeah, worked thanks, I ll drop  off . I ll see you on slack. very interesting topic Bradly. has a lot to do with chaoes theory from what I see.randomness, probability, deep myseteries of our universe

Jesse Parent
Jesse Parent says:
hot hand seems to have an uncomfortable realtionshpi with emobdiment and environment as well ; and perhaps strained assocaitions or anthropomorphism around sampling / sequences, randomness yes, and also the nature or acutal perspective of how a slection process is done 
Jesse Parent says:
The uncomfortability of , for a human being with general human perception and force control and evnironmental control, the outcome is sort of forced into this simplistic binary that is relatively at the range of 50%

## TRANSCRIPT
0:00     
good morning morning how are you I'm good how are you all     
0:05     
right so how things been going with you good um busy but feel more settled now     
0:14     
oh good yeah have you been moving or yeah moving um into a house that I own     
0:22     
okay some some work um yeah all is well well good yeah     
0:30     
that's great how you been pretty good I'm doing     
0:36     
all right been busy with all sorts of things     
0:47     
so yeah how's the um all the summer stuff going oh yeah     
0:53     
pretty good it's been like a few months since I've been here yeah well yeah we' doing we're doing the Google summer up     
0:59     
code we doing the uh working on some papers and teaching and everything so     
1:04     
I'm pretty busy and then we've been taking a break from the uh the cognition feutures in the     
1:12     
cybernetics group so but we can do it we picked up a meeting in open source     
1:19     
so balances out I guess yeah I should be able     
1:26     
to do both of those groups this week week okay that's good yeah I guess I     
1:33     
don't know what Jesse wants to do with cognition features but um if people are available and have the time and energy I     
1:39     
can Le the cybernetics one on Thursday yeah yeah I think that'd be     
1:44     
great yeah get back into it     
1:50     
uh yeah great so glad you're doing     
1:56     
well I don't any updates for like things I've been working on because it's been     
2:02     
I've been working on things that have nothing to do with the group yeah well that's good yeah I bought some     
2:09     
books oh okay good I've just continued to download some papers but that's     
2:15     
that's it yeah we all download papers     
2:23     
so well Sarah and Morgan and Jesse good morning morning all right um     
2:32     
so yeah just catching up with Amanda she's been busy and she's kind of in the     
2:39     
back in the loop so um you know we'll be probably doing cybernetics reading group     
2:46     
this week this Thursday uh we had a good Diva worm last     
2:52     
week and we'll have one again this week and then we've got our open source meetings that are going on um and those     
2:59     
are going well um and so yeah and uh so I don't     
3:06     
know if uh we want to do updates I know Amanda said she didn't really have an update obviously but if we have other     
3:13     
updates from other people that was the     
3:20     
time well go go ahead yeah no I was just going to say I     
3:26     
mean I gave most of my open source I mean open those project updates yesterday so I'm kind of working on the     
3:34     
mod um but then there was this one paper that Morgan had also forwarded to me and     
3:40     
Jesse had also talked about in the goog sum channel so it was a paper that I read like long ago uh but I haven't     
3:47     
talked about it much in regards with my project because it was not that relevant I found     
3:53     
more uh but I like another paper that I could discuss and     
4:00     
yeah it be good yeah why don't we do that after update so we can talk about yeah sure sure so     
4:08     
yeah and yeah the sub updates I like I don't think that good but I'm working     
4:14     
with them good all right uh so     
4:20     
Morgan well I just wanted to give the update that Celsius the community bab in     
4:26     
San Francisco finished it's haveit grow almost anything course okay um and uh     
4:32     
this is this is great well you do think lots lots was learned along the way um     
4:39     
as well as it was good to identify the kind of equipment that we need to be     
4:45     
able to do the full MIT course this like a synthetic intro to synthetic bio     
4:51     
course um and but really good news in terms of     
4:56     
the you know the amount of money it brought in the the the the people that     
5:03     
came as as students um and then ended up you know contributing to to the     
5:10     
biolab um yeah so it's it's it's really great like I I think we're we're looking     
5:16     
at some places that uh we might be able to get a lease on get get our own space     
5:22     
as opposed to using kind of a co-working lab space but that was that's kind of     
5:27     
cool um there's lots of lots of great papers out there um especially in computational Psychiatry um in kind of     
5:35     
precision medicine in particular um Le Williams lab in Stanford's got a really interesting paper but I'm sure we've got     
5:44     
plenty to talk about yeah yeah yeah thanks Morgan for that update     
5:50     
um how about Jesse how are you hey     
5:58     
um okay I'm a lot I yesterday was funny because I intended to be sitting at a     
6:05     
cafe and have very nice chat much of yesterday and that was totally disrupted     
6:11     
by uh the NBA Championship parade in     
6:17     
Boston um kind kind of ended up walking     
6:22     
like directly through it to get to where I needed to go and it the parade itself moved much faster so um expected so it's     
6:31     
kind of funny it was sort of like unintentionally being filtered into the you know uh like     
6:40     
a choke pointed into it oh eventually I was just like okay but it it was it was     
6:46     
it was fun um beyond that what's what's the real     
6:53     
update um I'm finally     
7:01     
into a summer period     
7:07     
uh and it's the the finals are done and this week has     
7:12     
been both interesting in that sense and     
7:17     
also there was kind of this I don't know I know I know Boston     
7:23     
isn't the hottest place in the country and and had people who dealt with de L     
7:28     
all over the the country country and stuff but the way the heat wave was here it really was a shutdown so for like 3     
7:37     
days this week there really wasn't a lot to do     
7:42     
which was I guess nice but also a little bit frustrating because I'm kind of I'm kind of dealing with this okay now I get     
7:48     
to work on all my projects you know like when you're when you when you kind of start hanging     
7:56     
around the academic people and the professors and stuff     
8:01     
they they get excited for the summer because okay now I get to focus on what I want to do and it's different from     
8:07     
when you're like a younger student go Su I get to do nothing do whatever you know I get to whatever go go away and it's a     
8:14     
bit of that Vibe there's a number of things and also I kind of wanted to comment a little bit on what became of     
8:20     
the research management slack for oh yeah we can get to that later like     
8:26     
what's emerging there is good uh but there's sort of a I think it kind     
8:34     
of you know has brought about a I guess people wanted to have     
8:40     
those kind of discussion but it's also kind of funny because because um like     
8:46     
the way some conversations have emerged were     
8:52     
um I don't know I don't know I don't have to comment on that fully I'll come back to that later but let thing for     
8:58     
General update for now so General updates for this week um I'm I'm     
9:04     
basically trying to plan out the summer but what do I want to do basically between now and September 1st uh because     
9:12     
there's a lot going going on for me um there's some things I'm trying to     
9:18     
follow up with at UCSD uh there's a lot in terms of I     
9:25     
think I did a very kind of um typically unstructured and and not very     
9:33     
clear discussion I think last Friday about NLP and and the quest of uh you     
9:43     
know I I was saying how I appreciated the last two weeks of the NLP course were actually about ethics and World     
9:50     
bias which is a specific thing and that ways of mitigating bias and we did the     
9:56     
final project for that of course had to do with you know uh look at a paper attempting to     
10:02     
mitigate bias and and the the sort of tension     
10:08     
between uh NLP as a field of study and and how much is that field of study     
10:13     
engaging with these subdisciplines that have that are making these their models and databases and data sets that that     
10:19     
are are subject to NLP and and so on and I just I was I really appreciate that     
10:26     
and I think that is an interesting [Music]     
10:32     
um the one of my biggest takeaways from this term unexpectedly or     
10:37     
unintentionally is sort of what it's sort of I don't know what to     
10:43     
call it like I kind of want to use this word that's essentially something like data     
10:49     
strategy uh because it's not quite ethics and it's not quite you know     
10:55     
fairness and accountability like those are all related terms there not quite like dat scence there's the data science     
11:01     
uh of of you know doing the things like the process of of data the process of     
11:08     
cleaning the data the process of building the model testing the model all that stuff like that's that's that's     
11:14     
all you know um part of it but there's also this strategic element that's     
11:20     
emerged from both     
11:26     
um that's that's come about maybe most explicitly what was the data ethics     
11:31     
course which is sort of makes sense but like I've said that course has sort of been the most applied course in a lot of     
11:39     
ways even though it's maybe the one of the least Le lesser technical courses     
11:45     
it's it's sort of the most applied in terms of the actual communication strategy how do we talk about this how     
11:51     
do we communicate how do we identify how do we sort of deal with the philosophy or the applied interactions and the     
11:58     
choices so between that and the NLP course um     
12:04     
it's been really I'm I'm I'm at a very different vantage point or I'm at a new vantage point in terms of like what can     
12:11     
be done in these spaces so a lot of things are swirling in the arena of society ethics technology a lot of     
12:18     
things are squirreling I did I did my the NLP bias paper focused on     
12:25     
um uh mental health space topic um about associations for like gender is a very     
12:32     
common bias in in NLP things in associations but then like sort of     
12:38     
gender plus mental health and in like both receiving health or receiving care or feelings about people with mental     
12:44     
health conditions that was the the Bas reviewing a paper on that and it was it wasn't you know anything groundbreaking     
12:51     
but it it was sort of a a nice example of okay here's trying to do sort of     
12:58     
Interest sectional or complicated takes on uh bias that's more than just one one     
13:06     
one feature um but so the vantage point that I'm from     
13:13     
now is okay what what can I do to sort     
13:19     
of take some of the things we've been looking at in society EIC technology for     
13:24     
a while and how can quote unquote data science or maybe this thing that I'm     
13:30     
talking about is data strategy or data science strategy or something of that nature and do more things with it or     
13:38     
like refine or bring bring out of conceptual phases into     
13:43     
more kind of creating these analytical Tools around them that's that's that's a     
13:50     
a a new vantage point that I really haven't had before as as sort of One     
13:55     
update um there there also is a lot of things     
14:03     
going on for Joe Pro and some things potentially happening for Twisters plot     
14:08     
Twisters unfortunately I don't know what to say yet and really want to be able to     
14:15     
say more and do more but uh it's kind of to be determined but     
14:23     
um there's there's a lot of potential I still maybe I should I I had to sideline     
14:30     
doing it but maybe I should post the inclusive gaming conference U post this week I didn't really put that uh in the     
14:36     
medium or anything like that um and that's I as I said um that's been a huge     
14:43     
huge uh event because I've been following a number of people from it uh     
14:49     
we have people from I think Klo Schnell was one of the panelists and she works     
14:56     
at I think a place called player research and um there's a number of she has a     
15:04     
Blog she has a a a her group which I believe was about sort of what it sounds     
15:10     
like people interacting video games players and stuff like that or people using devices he has a Blog series on     
15:20     
um incorporating sort of more modern and inclusive practices     
15:25     
into um like how to run an organization or how to run a a you know it's not say     
15:31     
software development but a a development company like like I way like different     
15:37     
ways of doing that that fit some of the the ethos of the inclusive ging comerce but also things that we're talking about     
15:42     
here in in terms of Open Source uh R like running an open source team or the     
15:48     
thing like sort of a different taking what what is happening in open source communities or what could happen in not     
15:54     
the level of interacting with the files talking about there but other     
16:00     
foundational components how these things are working and I think that's a really interesting uh and important space to be     
16:07     
in and and part of the things that I do want to continue to talk about in maybe let's say the research management     
16:14     
Channel which again we'll talk about that later um but um that's that's     
16:22     
one the the outcome from that that event has continues to be really uh strong and     
16:29     
powerful I I didn't get to look at this but some one of the other people who was there is um reading about funding for     
16:36     
all sorts of assisted technology happening in in Europe and and update just kind of seeing the updates of what     
16:42     
this person's doing um is is very useful no less like Amanda Curtis who sort of     
16:49     
PL is Affiliated but a um a major organizer at the event is has     
16:56     
been doing a lot of really cool research and is doing something with one of my other friends participated in a I think     
17:04     
it was Zelda one of the later Zelda games as such for her research and just     
17:10     
um getting getting unexpectedly the the way that     
17:16     
that they the different research basically what I hoped is is true like seeing     
17:21     
everybody at the event doing their actual normal research and projects is really fueling quite a lot of things so     
17:29     
um some future plans for that are like I might invite people to talk here or I might try to do some collaboratory     
17:36     
things here with that I know orthogonal lab doesn't do a whole lot in that sense     
17:42     
directly but I mean we have people looking on 3 the environments we have people working on you know people in in     
17:50     
the industry and and in similar spaces and doing Tech related stuff and all this stuff so it's there's a lot there     
17:56     
and I I continue to be excited about that um and briefly my last General     
18:04     
update is um I haven't really done I haven't I     
18:10     
haven't done labor under the Joe Pro Banner directly for like basically three     
18:15     
weeks the whole finals period I really I didn't get to do anything that that that month uh but my B some some goals I'm     
18:25     
having there are finishing updating the website and finishing updating the structure of some of the working groups     
18:31     
including the mental health working group and uh Jen is doing a lot there     
18:39     
and I really appreciate that um she she's sort of aiming to do some social     
18:44     
work masters of social work related things but also for those who aren't     
18:49     
familiar with social work um there's sort of an interesting and difficult divide at the uh training level between     
19:00     
micro and macro social work or like Theory and policy versus like having a clinical practice and so that's been a     
19:06     
very interesting space to I have friends who have actually gone through it but now it's like I get to be much closer to     
19:12     
hearing what what it's like as someone's choosing where to go what to do and what programs are out there actually you Mich     
19:20     
you University of Michigan has a very nice like online     
19:25     
uh uh like corsera type intro program that     
19:31     
has like going through that what's it like how are they talking about these things so the mental health working     
19:37     
group is coming along um there's also sort of it's been interesting to talk about uh the movie Inside Out it was     
19:45     
inside out to that came out I actually saw that um and that sort of built     
19:50     
around a a psychology emotional model like a interal family systems IFS and     
19:59     
it's it's it's you know it's it's a movie and it's movie for for for kids     
20:04     
and we can talk about it at some point not really for kids I should say but it's it's sort of aimed at that um I     
20:10     
actually really like the first one I'm I'm the second one um we'll see but it's     
20:16     
it's sort of you know these accessible models of of talking about emotion of     
20:22     
talking about structure of of talking about modeling other people's situations     
20:27     
and their emotional drive versus it's interesting um that's that's a little     
20:33     
bit of a you know a certain flavor of things but otherwise um there's a lot of     
20:42     
uh things that might fall into you know the DSM project is still     
20:48     
ongoing and I'm basically kind of bridging that under the Gap under the under the I don't know banners of of     
20:55     
somewhat cognition Futures but also like I think it's also wellhouse and what the uh working group is is going is     
21:02     
Flushing out to be about so yeah that's that's a pretty broad smattering of     
21:07     
updates but I will turn the mic back over to to you all unless there's other     
21:14     
questions about that right yeah so thank you for the     
21:21     
update uh Paul said hello everyone what is the event Jus is talking about I think he was talking about um     
21:29     
plot Twisters right I I mentioned a whole bunch of things so I have no idea what     
21:35     
but I think that's when it happened so and she yeah plot Tes isn't an event for     
21:41     
what it's worth it's it's a group I mean the inclusive gaming conference I guess     
21:47     
oh yeah okay um yeah so that's good um so I     
21:54     
guess Hussein and Paul are here welcome um did you any     
22:00     
updates yeah so uh I had just spoken the other day um happy to reiterate some     
22:05     
things um uh is okay I mean I guess I can share I can share no problem yeah um     
22:10     
so I just I just woke with the other day during the open source meeting so I guess Amanda and Paulo weren't there so     
22:17     
um with regards to the breast cancer Community demography approach yeah uh Di and I have been making some good     
22:23     
progress and uh oh yeah maybe maybe Jesse was there the other day too I'm not sure if Jesse was here yesterday     
22:29     
but like uh yeah we're moving more into the uh uh excuse me we're moving we're     
22:34     
moving pretty steadily into the simulation side of things and having a lot of strong discussions on how to um     
22:40     
best adjust the geometry of uh these uh methods of steering x-rays with respect of the Janos speres to see how well and     
22:47     
how Clos they can be refined to uh basically make the experience as best as they can for um everybody involved     
22:54     
and um you know a lot of it really comes down to understanding like the best ways to compress the breast and figure out     
23:01     
the geometry the math and the physics to optimize it with respect to the current Hardware technology we're using so yeah     
23:08     
it takes a lot of work a lot of very technical thorough discussions but you know a lot of it is very very very exciting so you know like we've been     
23:15     
talking about so yeah yeah yeah great yeah thanks U yeah so and then we also     
23:23     
want to talk about this research um discussions Channel or what is is it called uh     
23:31     
research management channel on slack but we'll do that in a little bit and that     
23:37     
involves a couple people still um but SAR I wondered if you wanted to give your presentation on the paper yeah so     
23:45     
like the generative agents paper U basically like I had come across this uh     
23:51     
quite early on when I was just kind of trying to learn more about agent based modeling and     
23:58     
um like trying to do agent based modeling and results uh using llms so     
24:06     
this is like this is like one of the great papers um that kind of um gave like a very nice     
24:15     
of like they achieved very nice results uh with it and then also recently like     
24:22     
what a people share this paper on slack uh so I thought I'll go to it so     
24:28     
basically what it does is uh they just kind of tried to simulate the entire     
24:35     
human world like a small town basically where there is a school there is a cafe     
24:41     
there is a election at some point uh so it's basically like everything that     
24:48     
would happen in a real life world and they've taken inspiration from The Sims game and what they've done is like there     
24:56     
are uh 25 agents in this town each agent is powered by an LM and they just kind     
25:03     
of let those agents run wild and they've observed very uh specific like uh very     
25:13     
uh human characteristic behaviors come out of these agents and then like     
25:18     
there's very specific architecture kind of to how theyve done it so yeah basically they're like     
25:25     
they're introducing generative agents as computational software agents that simulate Rel Behavior where they can do     
25:34     
all these different tasks waking up cooking breakfast talking to each other and because they talk to each other it's     
25:41     
like they form opinions and notice each other and they can also have     
25:46     
conversations uh not just have conversations but then they can like remember and reflect on those     
25:51     
conversations to be able to form opinions and do other like continue the     
25:57     
entire cycle so it's not not not like very short Liv in that     
26:03     
sense so so basically the the main contribution of the paper is this like     
26:09     
architecture uh where like it's not just a large language model it is a large     
26:14     
language model combined with the ability to store the agent experience basically     
26:19     
the memory of it uh so kind of like have a memory structure then they also come     
26:26     
up with a really clever way to to synthesize those basic memories which are like kind of in a log format to     
26:33     
higher level Reflections which is what enabled the very humanik behaviors to     
26:40     
emerge and based on these Reflections they also have the ability to retrieve     
26:47     
the reflections to be able to plan what the next Behavior should be so so yeah     
26:53     
the sandbox envirment that I described it's based on the S     
26:59     
um and they've given examples I so yeah basically like the three main     
27:06     
things that they've kind of simulated kind of um     
27:11     
contributed is uh so the first one is the fact that uh there is uh the memory     
27:21     
stream which is like this uh long-term memory module uh which can store a lot     
27:27     
of memory so I still remember that like when I was looking through this paper and I look through their code as well uh     
27:35     
so the in this paper they exclusively use the gp4 model uh the gp4 model has a     
27:42     
128k context length which is why basically these llms are able to remember a huge chunk of Prior     
27:50     
information whenever they're uh trying to make any new inference so it's very     
27:57     
like like similar to the human sense that and then uh so the first is this     
28:04     
memory stream where they just kind of store everything that the that they go     
28:10     
through like whatever is happening in the environment whatever the agent is going through all of the experiences     
28:16     
coupled with this memory stream is this memory retrieval model I'll talk about it later that this is quite um quite a     
28:23     
unique contribution it's a it's it's R retrieval augmented generation done in a very specific way uh for     
28:31     
their uh architecture and then the next is uh     
28:36     
reflection so like the first is memory stream the next is they give these models specific prompts that allow them     
28:45     
to look back at the memories and get insights from them and basically that is how they can     
28:52     
draw conclusions and then the third is planning which is like the kind of look     
28:57     
at all the relevant information they have and try to plan their whole day out and then execute that     
29:04     
plan so um so yeah it's basically like they're trying to create social role     
29:12     
scenarios and     
29:18     
um yeah so like they also described a lot of related work um I I'll skip that     
29:28     
right now and I'll go into the how the how their model actually works okay so     
29:34     
they've created this uh their own basically Game World kind of sandbox world called small bill um it has these     
29:42     
agents in it and uh so the first is like they kind of give these agents um each     
29:51     
of these agents a very specific description so even in their code like they have a one whole Json file for each     
29:59     
agent's background information so it's like this description where basically     
30:04     
they describe what the agent does who he likes what his hobbies are who are the     
30:11     
important people in his life like his wife son that describe the relationships and uh like all of this     
30:18     
goes into like the basic description file and uh what it does is basically     
30:24     
every time the agent is going to make a new INF or going to make a new observation or     
30:32     
anything uh this entire description will be there in the context of the prompt uh     
30:39     
so basically it's like the like no two agents even though they will have the same llms powering them not two agents     
30:46     
will behave the same way they will behave based on this description that they have that the llm believes that it     
30:52     
is John and it will behave like John uh so basically yeah all everything     
30:59     
goes into the agent's initial memory at the very start from this description um then they've described     
31:06     
like uh I believe three types of two types of communication so the first is     
31:12     
Agent agent communication or inter agent communication uh basically it's like at     
31:18     
every given time like at every time step the agent puts out a uh statement of     
31:24     
what they are currently doing like writing in the journal or talking with the family and then uh this is kind of     
31:32     
translated one into movements in the world so the if the agent says that I'm going to bed then the in the     
31:40     
visualization also the agent will go to bed and also there's like this     
31:48     
um um basically like they they come they use this to communicate with each other     
31:54     
as well so basically all of this that they uh like at every time step the     
31:59     
statement that they evoke kind of goes into a global memory log so the other     
32:05     
agents who are nearby will know what this agent is doing and then if they want to have external communication they     
32:11     
talk to each other so as I said they're aware of other agents in the local area     
32:16     
and whenever they walk by they can engage in conversation like     
32:22     
statistically uh sorry probabilistically deted and then     
32:28     
uh if they do talk then they just basically use like proper natural language uh and the next is like the     
32:37     
user can also kind of interact communicate with the agent in national language by the like the     
32:46     
Persona so basically like uh the the     
32:51     
user can kind of become the like the the original description from that     
32:59     
so it will kind of get entered there and then the so this was like uh agent     
33:05     
communication and then there is how the agents will interact with the environment     
33:12     
so uh basically there is this uh like the movements are controlled by their     
33:18     
natural language thoughts that they have and there will be a user controlled     
33:24     
agent also which they will just creat as a normal agent and     
33:31     
um yeah basically they can influence the the state of the objects like uh the so     
33:39     
every just like at every time step uh every agent will say what it is doing like it is getting ready for bed or it     
33:45     
is getting ready to eat there are various um objects also like     
33:51     
refrigerator or whatever and then uh th those things will also have the are like     
33:58     
uh States kind of if it is full or empty and even that will get translated to natural language at every time St so it     
34:06     
can be idle or it can be full or it can be empty and those also keep getting     
34:12     
contributed to the logs so that way the agents kind of know so basically like     
34:18     
just as if if this is the state then it gets converted into a natural language and then the agent can notice this     
34:26     
because it gets stor in the log so that's how like the agent interacts with the environment it's all bya natural     
34:33     
language it's there's no other like sensory inut     
34:39     
um and then there's like this basic example that they've given which is like     
34:44     
uh the so along with the description there's also kind of like a basic     
34:50     
morning routine that they kind of start off each agent to it which like you wake up they take a Shar gets dressed     
34:56     
whatever and and then the agent starts interacting with the other agents um     
35:04     
and the so now like this is an example where they illustrate how they are     
35:09     
working starts where like uh they can recall the previous conversation like if     
35:15     
they had a conversation here about uh the son saying that he's working on a     
35:21     
new music composition um the dad can then tell the same thing to the mom that     
35:26     
he's working on this a comption uh based on the memory that it has and then is     
35:33     
like how um the the actual social behaviors that are emerging so the only     
35:39     
program thing is the kind of description for the background story we can say of     
35:45     
each agent and a kind of a basic routine that they will follow like if it's a     
35:51     
student will W up go to school Etc these are the things given in the prompt but     
35:56     
then there are a lot lot of uh emergent social behaviors like exchanging     
36:02     
information with agents that are nearby forming relationships of those conversations are nice and also     
36:09     
coordination among agents so these are uh not like pre program they're not told     
36:15     
to do this exactly they said they can do this and like these social behaviors     
36:21     
are observe so basically like they they     
36:27     
notice in their experiments that as these agents notice each other they're in the same local this so in in this     
36:35     
sense like even though we are viewing a visualization of the agents being close     
36:41     
together the only way these llm agents will realize they close together is they'll be able to hear the uh outputs     
36:49     
given out by the other agent so once they realize that they're close they can     
36:54     
choose to engage in dialogue and once engage in dialogue they can basically     
36:59     
spread information like what is stored in one agent's memory via conversation     
37:05     
that information will go to some other agents so a great example that they give here is about uh an election like there     
37:13     
is one agent who decides to run for mayor talks about it to one person and then     
37:21     
later uh after the person was going to stand in the election leaves the other     
37:27     
two people talk about his candidacy in the election and soon it basically becomes a talk of the time and like it's     
37:35     
kind of a very um like human thing of how uh something important or something     
37:42     
like gossip will kind of spread very quickly because everyone will be talking about um and then the next is uh the     
37:51     
relationship memory like uh uh basically there will be some basic relationships     
37:58     
defined at the start like a wife and a son but they will also form new relationships over time uh they will do     
38:05     
this by remembering their interactions and if they have many interactions uh they you know remember     
38:12     
what the other person does and slowly it will be more and more like much like     
38:18     
human life they'll have more memory of the other person and then they also noticed that     
38:24     
they coordinate with each other like uh if there is a party going to happen so     
38:30     
if there is one person who has taken the responsibility to decorate but if that     
38:36     
person asks for another person's help in decorating then the other agent can agree they will actually plan out that     
38:43     
at this time I have to go help this other person and they will you know kind     
38:49     
of come and help so uh so basically the these are the social behaviors that they     
38:55     
like kind of again observe like spreading the word of something or decorating even asking each other out as     
39:03     
a crush Etc so all of these are kind of uh the     
39:09     
the results of the behaviors that they saw so like uh like uh I mean from a     
39:16     
technical perspective the architecture also was kind of quite uh     
39:22     
um important to me uh basically like the the way all of this work um and the the     
39:32     
way it uh the way it can't just work with any model is the context length     
39:39     
which is like the biggest problem with large language models because there is only a certain amount of memory that     
39:45     
they can uh keep in mind before they start forgetting and um start just uh     
39:54     
coming up with random answers which are not relevant so for that they build they     
40:00     
have something very specific that this new memory kind of architecture so the     
40:06     
first is basically the memory and retrieval module that we so for it uh they basically have like     
40:16     
um yeah so they have these three things so like this kind of is the memory     
40:22     
stream that I kept talking about like the log that I talked about earlier where if like every every kind of object     
40:31     
will say what it is doing at that time step um and then also the agents will     
40:37     
also say what they're doing at the time step and this is kind of how the other people will be able to     
40:43     
observe and this will like continuously keep being generated as in when anything is     
40:50     
happening and uh this is like a very big memory stream so all of this can't     
40:57     
really go into the uh the the um context     
41:03     
of the llm prom like every time if uh something is uh um if llm has to be     
41:11     
queried about what they are doing or what the other agents are doing uh they     
41:16     
need the context of that but we can't just copy this entire memory stream into the context so for that they have uh     
41:23     
used retrieval augmented generation retrieval augmented generation is basically like a database for llms where     
41:31     
like if we have a normal website we wouldn't just put all the information in the cach most of the information will be     
41:37     
in the database and you'll send an API call to retrieve to query the exact information that you need and based on     
41:43     
the query you will get a response back so retrial ored generation works the     
41:50     
same way where all the natural language information when it is a la is just put into this other database and instead of     
41:57     
being stored as natural language it is stored as embeddings and every time you need to     
42:04     
query uh you uh the query is also in natural language which gets converted     
42:10     
into an EMB and then a similarity score is found between the two embeddings embeddings are just basically numerical     
42:17     
vectors and a similarity score is found between them and based on the     
42:23     
similarities for the relevant uh document is retrieved which is basically     
42:29     
the the actual natural language text that the embedding was formed from so     
42:35     
now here like uh basically this is a memory stream that is there in a     
42:41     
database and if any agent is asked that what they're looking forward to the most     
42:46     
right now where right now is kind of important so basically what the agent     
42:53     
does is has makes this as the query and queres this entire memory stream and     
43:00     
these are the three responses that the um uh that the agent gets from its     
43:09     
database of memory uh where the first is like that Isabella Rodriguez is excited     
43:15     
about planning this Valentine's Day party and then the that person is going     
43:20     
to order decorations for the party and they're going to research ideas for the party so basic basically like these     
43:28     
numbers here are these retrieval scores or these similarity scores and based on those uh scores like     
43:36     
the highest score is uh becomes the answer so this is the answer and the agent basically curates a response based     
43:44     
on that so the like RG is something very     
43:49     
largely used with llm but what this paper does is it defines three     
43:55     
components that work together basically R will try to match the relevance and it     
44:03     
is usually used for question answering but uh in our uh world the like in this     
44:09     
world the uh memory is kind of linear     
44:14     
so uh so the like one of the things that matters a lot is the recency or the what     
44:21     
time this uh thing took place basically there could be a much more interesting     
44:26     
event but that would have happened last week so the agent wouldn't be looking forward to it right now so which is why like     
44:33     
recent events are important so what this paper does is this retrieval score is actually made up of three components     
44:40     
recency important and importance and relevance and recency is the score of     
44:46     
like how uh on top or how um uh how recently this observation was     
44:56     
created and they have like a DK factor for it     
45:01     
then there is importance which basically is like um uh how important that thing is     
45:11     
so the way they get this important score is they ask the large language model only that every time they have a memory     
45:19     
they ask the model to kind of rate it and say what is the exact um importance     
45:25     
of it or the score of it and then there is relevance relevance is the basic RH implementation like uh it     
45:33     
is done by calculating the similarity for between the two vors and then they     
45:40     
what they do is they have a sum total of all of these and they normalize it and     
45:47     
then they get the final rep score so this is something that has worked really well and then the other two great things     
45:54     
in the architecture one is reflection it can be very nice summarized by this diagram basically there is memory which     
46:01     
memory is just comprised of observations like this is Idle this person is doing     
46:06     
this this person is doing that but what they do is uh periodically they ask the     
46:12     
these llms to infer Reflections or infer opinions from observations like if there     
46:18     
are a number of observations about Cloud smeller reading different things the     
46:24     
reflection that the llm gets is that uh Cloud spends many hours reading so     
46:30     
basically based on observations the llm makes these like own opinions about     
46:37     
stuff and those Reflections also get stored along with the other memories so     
46:43     
when this retrieval part is working it will not just get pure memories like     
46:48     
these are pure memories but this would be something like a reflection so uh     
46:54     
basically both of these things would be ined uh and query um and yeah and then uh so like     
47:04     
they have like a kind of prompt for this to they just ask the llm based on these statements get some insights and then     
47:11     
the last thing is like planning and reacting where they encourage the um llm     
47:18     
to kind of make like an exact plan like um for 180 minutes I will be uh doing     
47:24     
this I will be taking notes for my research paper or for this much 1 p.m.     
47:30     
to 5:00 p.m. I will be doing this so then they uh based on all their previous     
47:35     
observations they have a plan and they always plan for the future and like this is also like the in their early     
47:41     
observations they realize that if they don't do this the llm will just repeat the same event again and again like it     
47:48     
will have lunch at 12:00 p.m. it will have lunch at 1 p.m. it will keep having lunch so which is why it needs to have     
47:54     
an exact plan and that tells it that it has has finished lunch so and then the     
48:00     
other thing was about how they update PL so they have like an action Lo and if     
48:06     
something like something there are uh like there are perceived obss and there     
48:12     
are pre-made plans and at different times The Prompt llm so if at any point     
48:17     
of time the perceived observation or the current observation says that your earlier plan     
48:25     
is not valid anymore then llm will just update the plan so basically it will be     
48:30     
able to adapt to Dynamic changes environment and yeah so the uh and then     
48:40     
uh yeah this is also something that I talked about earlier like the the from     
48:45     
the world environment everything that is in the world environment is converted to natural language to for the agents to be     
48:52     
able to understand and everything the agents do is converted back to the structured World environment and they     
48:59     
basically use like a tree data structure to kind of model the entire world where they have like there's a kitchen its     
49:05     
child is a stove and such and yeah they like quite     
49:12     
interesting paper I won't go more I think into detail um they also got like     
49:19     
a pretty good results like their evaluation method was basically just asking them about different things and     
49:27     
also react uh interacting using the user agent and like the the emerging     
49:34     
behaviors that I talked about earlier were also like one of the big kind of     
49:40     
results of the papers that they were able to get all these very humanik behaviors out of the     
49:46     
simulation and um yeah so there's like there are a lot of papers inspired by     
49:52     
this one as well um one that like I also talked about in my earlier blogs which     
49:58     
is called humanoid agents and that is also uh that is basically like it builds     
50:04     
upon this paper and uh introduces uh like system one     
50:10     
thinking so so yeah and also like another thing     
50:15     
that like basically Lang made an entire um kind of implementation of uh this     
50:23     
generative agents like generative agents have their own code also on guub but     
50:29     
lanin made like a specific generative agent memory kind of thing and what they     
50:34     
do use in that is this time baed Vector ST which is like what I described like     
50:40     
the kind of unique thing that they have which is they are using both semantic     
50:47     
similarity as well as this like uh recency kind of metc so uh like the     
50:54     
paper is well known enough for lin to kind kind of make this this as well as they have a generative agents class also     
51:00     
and then like anybody can now kind of use this very easily in their own um     
51:07     
projects as so the     
51:12     
link all right that that looks great thank you um I had a few actually I had a few     
51:19     
qu well Jesse had a few questions in the chat I had a few questions could you bring the paper back up I wanted to see     
51:25     
sure something if you could go up towards the top there was something like in the second or third page I was     
51:30     
interested in but this is very good this is actually um let me go let's do this yeah     
51:39     
go down um let's     
51:47     
see I think it was maybe relevant proxies the human behavior go up a     
51:52     
little bit so     
51:58     
this one no up further I think maybe two one or something the believable proxies     
52:04     
the human behavior yeah so this is uh where they talk about believability and the prior     
52:11     
literature so this describes believability or believable agents uh which are to provide an     
52:18     
illusion of Life present a facade of realism in the way they appear to make     
52:23     
decisions and act on their own valtion so it's like it representation of a human so like if you think back to the     
52:29     
Sims game you know they're sort of these simulations of humanity the idea there     
52:35     
was to simulate and we've talked about Sim City and some of the ways that they did that but in The Sims of course they     
52:43     
simulate kind of like human behavior kind of in the day of a life in the day     
52:48     
of type thing so like you know you have humans that are interacting they're doing their thing they're doing these     
52:54     
rituals they're walking around and they're using a language that is like kind of like a a fake language or     
53:02     
an urat language but they have all these components that make you think oh this is like a human this this makes me think     
53:10     
that this is like a human and of course it's not a human but it's like believable enough which is I think is     
53:16     
interesting that this is a way that and this has links to CH video games as well     
53:22     
uh NPCs and has links to some of these things where you know we want to     
53:27     
simulate something uh and you know what do we what are we trying what do we need to simulate to make it seem like it's a     
53:34     
good analog or even that it's really kind of informative because a lot of the     
53:39     
stuff in here is very much like you know very Co cognitive science in the way     
53:44     
they model human behavior so this is a really interesting paper in that respect too and then in this other passage down     
53:53     
here moreover more importantly game worlds provide uh oh no right there     
54:01     
however more importantly game worlds provide uh increasingly realistic     
54:07     
representations of real world affordances and and as observed by lar and Van Lent in 2001 these simulated     
54:15     
worlds off offer accessible test beds for developers of believable agents to     
54:20     
finesse the agent's cognitive capabilities without worrying about implementing robotics so this is     
54:26     
reference to uh the sore architectures and things like that cognitive models so     
54:33     
this is really interesting with respect to that as well they've got some more paragraphs     
54:38     
later just just next page on on sore and stuff oh okay yeah yeah yeah so like a     
54:44     
little little bit further down yeah yeah starting there cognitive architectures yeah okay     
54:51     
yeah for sure for sure Icarus yeah yeah     
54:57     
yeah as such these agents were deployed mostly in non-open World contexts such     
55:03     
as firsters shooter games or Blox worlds so yeah it you know this is a     
55:09     
great area like you know this believable agents or whatever but to have like something where you can     
55:15     
simulate enough of like cognition or human behavior some social world so that     
55:21     
we think you know okay this is something that's approximating the way we behave I     
55:26     
it's it's very very valuable thing and of course we can't you know simulate     
55:32     
everything about human behavior we don't know everything about human behavior but if we can get close enough at least with     
55:38     
some of these um environments and get an output that's like plausible and I think     
55:45     
we're making some progress and we can learn some things from it which we do from this paper     
55:51     
so yeah I think that this may you know I mean one one this paper     
55:56     
um got popular uh because a lot of us didn't play The Sims     
56:02     
yeah and but uh yeah I mean I I liked it just because they um you know there     
56:09     
there at the time certainly and I I think still in terms of multi-agent you     
56:15     
know reinforcement learning like there weren't a lot of examples of this kind of just uh open-ended experiments right     
56:23     
just putting putting a bunch of L AG together tracking their history and then     
56:29     
seeing how well they did in terms of you know um carrying     
56:36     
history sticking to character um you know and     
56:43     
yeah things like what what they described I think is their endtoend     
56:50     
text yeah so yeah and I like the the parameters that they're using using sort     
56:56     
of to for retrieval so like you know retrieval of course we know from memory     
57:02     
there's this aspect of memory which is like encoding things but then also retrieval and getting like those things     
57:09     
out based on like their you know recency and relevance and you know this is stuff     
57:15     
we've talked about of course in cognition Futures so it's like you know I think kind of thinking about it in     
57:21     
those terms we could maybe even update how we kind of build that memory kernel     
57:28     
you know saying okay well we want to have like this is the way we can represent memories or this is a way we     
57:35     
can represent sort of retrieving behaviors from like something we store     
57:40     
or you know we can actually kind of you know build those V new variables in     
57:47     
addition to some of the things they highlight here uh and and you know kind of model that so I think that's     
57:54     
interesting um from that standpoint because we've been looking for methodologies for probing um some of     
58:01     
these things we've been talking about cognition Futures without getting too deeply into it um you know and we don't     
58:06     
really have a lot of access to the to uh you know direct     
58:11     
experimentation for one reason is because we can't really you know it's really hard to design experiments to     
58:18     
look at those things but in the other sense you know we can do things with agents that we can't with humans and uh     
58:26     
uh you know non-human animals so you know it's it's that's another kind of methodology we could may be able to     
58:33     
use um so Jesse had some questions um so he said so this base     
58:39     
description and initial memory is inserted into all of the prompts and     
58:44     
then updated it seems over time so what's the relationship between prompts     
58:49     
and the I think yeah I believe like I've not exactly looked at the Cod this deep     
58:57     
but like what I believe is that Al so whenever an llms query they have like     
59:02     
two types of prompts one is a kind of a system prompt where the llm is told what     
59:09     
its role is uh and I think that is where they're inserting the like the base     
59:15     
description of the model so they're putting it into the system prom and then     
59:20     
there is the user prompt which is the current prompt and so yeah basically like as Jess he said like the system     
59:27     
prompt goes it's like appended to every prompt that is sent to the L because     
59:33     
that is like it's like it has to think like that     
59:39     
person so it has to be like kind of influence so I I don't think that is how     
59:44     
it is being done or they could have just put it in the memory but I don't think that would be working very well because     
59:52     
U because the memory is based on recency it would forget the initial MH yeah yeah     
59:58     
I don't know about the aition this factor     
1:00:04     
that um yeah it's it's very interesting     
1:00:09     
and I I think this kind of a followup to Brad discussion I'm not even going to go     
1:00:16     
into it here just because I I want to um this is a long this is a much longer     
1:00:22     
term thing but like I think would be really interesting not to how um we mentioned about a number of     
1:00:29     
qualities of of the agents and ways to sort of you know how how lifelike or     
1:00:36     
humanik is is the agent um what I think will be really interesting to do a     
1:00:44     
number of uh comparative testings of similarly     
1:00:49     
structured agents but like very different um Environmental social affordances in     
1:00:57     
in the actual environments there in I think that's something that I would be interested in doing in the future for     
1:01:06     
sure yeah uh so then some of the other questions that Jesse asked so retrieval     
1:01:13     
has Reflections which are synthesis of various observations that the agent has     
1:01:19     
been exposed to so retrieval yeah retrieval there is an an     
1:01:24     
equation at know if you can find it uh where they had the three     
1:01:29     
parameters um and then so let's let's look at that in the context of this     
1:01:34     
question right there yeah basic yeah so yeah retrieval is like based on the     
1:01:41     
memory but uh so what they're doing is um like they have this memory stream the     
1:01:48     
memory stream has all of these observations what they call observations that is like they directly infer from     
1:01:54     
the environment like um every agent you know kinds of kind of broadcasts it in a sense that they are     
1:02:01     
doing this and that becomes an obervation and then reflection is just kind of um uh it's it's kind of just     
1:02:09     
another prompt so what they do is like they they     
1:02:16     
basically query the 100 most recent records in the memory stream and then     
1:02:22     
prompt the language model saying that given only this information what are the three most Salient high level questions     
1:02:29     
you can answer about the subjects then this uh response basically     
1:02:35     
generates some candidate questions so this candidate question help like to understand what     
1:02:42     
are the main kind of subjects and in this memory and once they have these candidate questions then each candidate     
1:02:49     
question is again prompted uh as so where like they again then query uh for     
1:02:55     
the the subject so then they'll get all the statements about that particular subject and then they'll tell the llm to     
1:03:02     
kind of um uh what are the five high level insights you can infer from do stats and     
1:03:09     
then the answer to this kind of becomes a reflection this is the reflection and     
1:03:15     
then what they do is this reflection statement they again just store it at in the memory so then now when anything is     
1:03:23     
queried about Cloud M over using these parameters so the like the     
1:03:29     
candidates won't be just these uh observations but also the     
1:03:35     
reflections and yeah so basically like that's how it works first there is     
1:03:40     
reflection and then those reflection also get qu and there's also I believe there's free of Reflections where like     
1:03:47     
based on this reflection I had this reflection     
1:03:52     
yeah okay and then Jesse's third question was uh I'd be curious about giving larg language models personality     
1:04:00     
features and also doing a version of this that is essentially a d and campaign also with motivations and     
1:04:06     
narratives so I think that's where they're moving towards here they do mention things that are uh sort of     
1:04:12     
related to that and yeah it would be interesting to see and I I said that out of the context     
1:04:19     
of um I think I think like I may have mentioned the critical role show here     
1:04:25     
before but as essentially there there's sort of what's interesting about critical role or these     
1:04:32     
many there's many many shows that are like recordings or streamings of people playing DND you know um critical role is     
1:04:39     
interesting because there's a bunch of professional voice actors and and they all they're all they're also people that have a tremendously deep history with     
1:04:46     
each other so to just just background my my forthcoming comment a little bit     
1:04:52     
critical role is really interesting because you have this huge interplay between what's happening in the     
1:04:59     
game like just the charact there's there's a very the strong commit to role playing the human beings are totally     
1:05:06     
make beli in their character in in a in a game role and there's these like very simple there's this sort of you know     
1:05:13     
representative artifacts the game board or the the the miniature figures on the     
1:05:18     
screen and rolling the dice you have these like physical things but it's almost entirely in in the mind you know but     
1:05:27     
then you have the in interpersonal connections between you     
1:05:33     
know when when the DM's saying something or when someone's you know discussing something they're making a joke that the     
1:05:39     
human understands and and then there's also this addition when is like the critical     
1:05:45     
role itself like there's an audience there's a there's a local audience in the room then also this International     
1:05:51     
audience or this this internet audience so this this very like all these     
1:05:56     
different layers of communication are on display at once and I think it's really fascinating think about from that     
1:06:01     
perspective now what I was saying here is like the D andd campaign um I don't     
1:06:08     
I'm not suggesting to incorporate all of that right now because I think that's that's sort of a you know that's that's a much more     
1:06:18     
um different layers of things and different you know there's a touring test and there's sort of my version of     
1:06:24     
of that with with things but uh for specifically what what a model like this     
1:06:30     
could do in terms of the D andd campaign stuff would be like like I could imagine     
1:06:35     
scripting out this like set of things to go through     
1:06:41     
and and in a D and D sense of okay this person had these motivations or they start out this way or like if people     
1:06:48     
like people might be fam with like balers gate series is balers Gate 3 is really popular right now um but like     
1:06:54     
there's there you know a character starts out with this background and then is     
1:07:01     
iteratively changed by these different experiences over time like like getting to this you like I'm kind of imagining     
1:07:07     
creating these structures where someone gets to CH like it's in in bers Gate 3     
1:07:12     
you have the like major choices that are like about alignment and how does someone like retrench their past history     
1:07:17     
or make make other choices but what I'm getting at is like I'm thinking about this in the context largely of like plot     
1:07:23     
twisters and the game that we're making there and and the the dialogue and the reflection that's that's a major part of     
1:07:30     
that too and how do you sort of have these core memories in the Inside Out     
1:07:35     
language I suppose versus these other things that are happening and how like what is the consolidation mechanism um     
1:07:43     
so thinking about all that in the context not only of an open-ended world that's like hey whatever but also I want     
1:07:48     
to kind of go back and think about like the other the other the other less less open-ended worlds or maybe less open     
1:07:56     
narrative uh L open-ended structures like like the partially open-ended     
1:08:01     
situation of a d& campaign to would be interesting to flush out um in some way     
1:08:06     
that's more that that that to my last point is     
1:08:13     
like what's really interesting to think about there is the amount of open edness of the world versus the structure of     
1:08:20     
what you like if you're trying to do something educational or teaching or or what like what message are you conveying     
1:08:27     
in the nature of the open end this or not in that World um so that's a lot of interesting things to think about and I     
1:08:33     
pretty go through the paper yeah well four 4.3 is is definitely trying to get     
1:08:40     
it that those roles that you know that kind of D and D role playing yeah if you     
1:08:45     
keep keep going down you know the yeah sorry right there yeah yeah so     
1:08:51     
it's talking about like what's what's you know what's realistic what's unrealistic for the particular roles     
1:08:57     
that they've given they've given people and you know in a rough way yeah I I'm     
1:09:05     
kind of curious about the the planning you know how much planning there is like     
1:09:10     
they they do some good stuff with memory but but it is interesting you know the     
1:09:16     
it' be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent to playing on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for     
1:09:21     
four hours without moving yeah yeah     
1:09:28     
yeah yeah this wouldn't be cognitive science and or robotics without some     
1:09:34     
planning yeah in there yeah yeah yeah i' I'd love to see if the um I forget the     
1:09:41     
full name of this but it's like the winter school on cognitive models you     
1:09:47     
know it's like in India in kind of November sometime October November any     
1:09:55     
you know they cover like actar and sore and all you know all these things I I     
1:10:00     
would I'd love them to cover this game yeah yeah and like extensions to this     
1:10:07     
game to add you know kind of like what Yan Lon was talking about in terms of     
1:10:12     
his kind of six components yeah yeah yeah you remember you know we talked     
1:10:18     
about like we should you should get back to this that in terms of you know how many how many of his components are in     
1:10:24     
this and how many still kind of you know need need some implementation     
1:10:30     
yeah yeah about planning as well like so what like what they do is basically they     
1:10:38     
give like some information about the person and what they do is they give     
1:10:43     
like one day's plan like on February 12th the person did this this this yeah     
1:10:49     
now today is February 13 here is a similar plan and then they just leave     
1:10:55     
here and what llms do is they complete the earlier thing and because it has     
1:11:01     
like this earlier plan just there it will like you know kind of be similar to     
1:11:07     
it and it will try to incorporate whatever is like some new information     
1:11:13     
into it so like it'll be it'll be very Also regarding like even when Jesse said     
1:11:19     
like um interested about like more personality features in terms of LM so     
1:11:25     
like um this is a paper like gender agents is this paper and then there's another     
1:11:31     
paper called humanoid agents that basically like builds upon this as well     
1:11:37     
and what is like what they've done there is a lot of they've added a lot more personality features and they've gone     
1:11:44     
right into like uh emotions and uh not not emotions per say I think but     
1:11:53     
more like um so like uh things like self-esteem or     
1:11:59     
things like the basic needs and um non-basic needs and so yeah like emotion     
1:12:08     
and closeness so all of these are like the this this paper like focuses much     
1:12:14     
more on the um on the agent I would say and like much more on their own     
1:12:21     
personality and stuff so this will also be like a what is the title of this     
1:12:30     
paper yeah sure yeah we need the sirious     
1:12:36     
cybernetics corporation yeah well thank you for that     
1:12:41     
presentation that was very good um yeah that was awesome and so yeah just to     
1:12:46     
finish up with the Sara provided some links here to the Lang chain site that     
1:12:52     
she featured uh the AR arive paper for the first paper and then the archive     
1:12:58     
paper for the humanoid paper and then uh yeah humanoid agents and then Powell     
1:13:05     
said I me had mentioned personality issues the Gemini just yesterday it said     
1:13:10     
it was open to analysis and thank you Sara so so yeah we there I think there's     
1:13:16     
a lot to follow up on on this and definitely more to talk about so yeah maybe we can do follow up next week on     
1:13:23     
this too and with maybe uh we want to talk about the humanoid agents paper or something else this is     
1:13:30     
definitely U you know kind of food for thought uh going     
1:13:36     
forward okay so now I want to turn to this uh uh research management slack     
1:13:44     
Channel and I want to just want to go over that because we were talking about that earlier so this is the research     
1:13:50     
management channel uh this was something that we started on June 7th so this is     
1:13:56     
uh this was uh just something that was renamed uh and so Jesse would you like     
1:14:02     
to talk about this a little bit     
1:14:07     
or okay oh gave a thumbs up sorry could you say that again I was     
1:14:13     
would you like to talk about this channel a little bit or what you were getting at well uh yeah I mean there's     
1:14:20     
sort of two different things there's sort of like and I'm not saying we need to I'll change anything right now but     
1:14:26     
there sort of the     
1:14:31     
um originally the channel was about uh discussing at a functional level like     
1:14:40     
not it wasn't about man like lab Lab practices in our     
1:14:45     
lab uh or like doing research in our lab but that's sort of what the later     
1:14:50     
discussion came to be like a lot of the original posts are these conceptual things about     
1:14:57     
um uh like how did we talk about it a broader things to discuss and sort of a     
1:15:03     
component on uh you know uh mentoring but then     
1:15:10     
um you know me mentoring at a managerial level or other uh had arranging     
1:15:19     
conferences and things like that um and like how do we do that blah blah blah blah blah but then a lot of the     
1:15:24     
discussion would which um you know I I don't want to get in the way of but     
1:15:30     
there's this talk about mentoring and doing the research documents and Lucas Lucas appeared so hi hi Lucas Lucas did     
1:15:36     
me a while ago but then I kind of attempted to to further some conversation there but I guess it came     
1:15:43     
up here and so um there's I don't there's sort of     
1:15:50     
a a little disparity about what like originally happened and     
1:15:55     
where things are now but like I don't I'm not the things that people are talking about towards the later more     
1:16:01     
recent posts you know like go ahead and do it like I I don't I don't want to I don't want to inhibit anybody from doing     
1:16:07     
things that they want to do like I think that's that's a good you know the     
1:16:12     
conversations there are useful people want to do that they can um but there's sort of     
1:16:19     
a um I I want to find the right way to to Usher all of those things so I'm open     
1:16:25     
to hearing what we want to do and and so on yeah I think this is a good so you     
1:16:32     
know we've got a couple things here we have like kind of this mentoring theme that we're doing with uh you know we're     
1:16:39     
doing Google Sumer code of course we do mentoring kind of more generally with     
1:16:44     
different groups that come into the lab and then we of course have like people who are more experienced say in research     
1:16:51     
and people are less experienced in research and we can bring those people together so you know um we we've got     
1:16:59     
that in a number of ways uh not just research but in like kind of topical areas as well so I think that's useful     
1:17:06     
to have that kind of mentoring uh relationship and we don't haven't really     
1:17:12     
you know uh brought it together and I mean it kind of exists in the lab we     
1:17:17     
kind of have a mentoring not really a theme but like we talk about it a lot     
1:17:22     
but having like you know discussions about that is good I think and then you know things like um just things like     
1:17:30     
talking about different topics in acade Academia different topics in     
1:17:36     
professional development which we don't we do have a channel for professional development but I don't know when that     
1:17:43     
was last updated that was I guess Jesse posts there cross post things uh but     
1:17:49     
this is yeah it seems like there's a couple of things going on in this area but I think this is a good area     
1:17:55     
and I think about in terms of research management um and yeah paa raised the     
1:18:00     
point about having like peer mentoring which of course you know     
1:18:06     
is when people want to do something like write a paper you know we have people in     
1:18:12     
the lab who have written papers so it's like you can offer you know some mentorship there we have more structured     
1:18:19     
mentorship like Google summer code or some of our uh studentship that we've     
1:18:25     
had in the past and then of course our open source where we're talking about these topics in open source which is you     
1:18:32     
know hopefully people who don't have a lot of experience or exposure to open source will attend those meetings watch     
1:18:39     
them on YouTube and say oh yeah this is really interesting stuff you know there's a lot of stuff going on in the     
1:18:45     
area I had no idea so this these are all things that we can kind of build on and     
1:18:51     
yeah I don't know exactly how you know the question is how does this all fit     
1:18:57     
into research management how does it not and I like to be inclusive about it I like to say you know if it's about     
1:19:04     
research and it's about kind of making your efforts better in doing research     
1:19:10     
then that's what we want to get at and it doesn't really matter how it kind of fits in in a classified way so yeah this     
1:19:17     
is great um and then uh let's see Lucas     
1:19:23     
had mentioned something about his interests so Lucas is really you know interested in doing     
1:19:31     
things with research and and kind of doing getting to the point of writing a     
1:19:37     
paper and he's he's expressed interest in that we we actually worked on a paper and dor together um so uh Lucas's     
1:19:45     
comment I think it's a great idea to start an initiative subchannel under research management then everyone who     
1:19:51     
would like to contribute and start contributing every everything they know the scholarly paper 101 course Word     
1:19:58     
document for example someone could start writing their own notes about uh some biology related paper and how APA style     
1:20:06     
works and another person from a history background could talk about history papers in Chicago style little by little     
1:20:14     
we might have a bunch of resources and documents for people interested in scholarly papers we could even get an     
1:20:20     
expert like Bradley to write about biological analysis and how to run them uh so yes like different areas you have     
1:20:27     
different things that you do that that sort of fit into the research Banner you     
1:20:33     
know like biologists do things that are different from physicists from historians philosophers Etc but yeah I     
1:20:40     
think I think that's great um I don't exactly know how that would work like um     
1:20:47     
I mean you could have like things like collaborative papers we do have that sort of already um you know and then of     
1:20:53     
course people have their expertise they can lend it to that that's sort of unstructured though that it's hard to     
1:21:00     
pull that off and we need to kind of think about like for example usin has a     
1:21:05     
paper that he's wanting to get collaborators on and paa is talking about being a collaborator on it this is     
1:21:12     
the um ethical stimulation paper and so you know how do we organize all of our     
1:21:18     
collaborators around that um that's something we need to work on I think and that would be a good place to work on it     
1:21:24     
but also like having expertise you know we could offer like tutorials in     
1:21:30     
different areas here's how you do research like I mean I could probably     
1:21:35     
offer something to say about how you would build a pipeline say in bioinformatics or something like that     
1:21:42     
just just as an example um I don't know how useful that is but it's definitely     
1:21:48     
something that could be you know put out there um as sort of like a as some     
1:21:53     
research or educ educational resources and you know might be useful for people     
1:21:58     
to to think about okay this is how you do this research this is how I can Implement things data analysis the same     
1:22:06     
thing this is how I Implement things step by step because if I just kind of do it on my own I not familiar with the     
1:22:13     
tools I have to play around with it and and make mistakes and although that's     
1:22:18     
good in some ways it's also good to have like some guidance there and and what the best practices     
1:22:26     
so and and just to kind of bring about this like another another approach to this is sort of or     
1:22:33     
another commentary I'll put on sort of my not quite Headmaster but like my     
1:22:40     
my chromogen senior like academic hat and say this     
1:22:47     
like well you know also like and maybe we we don't stress this enough for     
1:22:53     
people coming into to the lab we talk about like how to orl contribution guides but like if you want to do     
1:23:01     
anything or make a project what I would suggest you do you can mention it to us     
1:23:07     
like to Bradley or me or whomever you want to but also a     
1:23:14     
very standard base of it is mention it at our weekly meetings often like talk     
1:23:21     
about it say oh I'm interested in the topic of you know llms or generative     
1:23:28     
agents I'm interested in this paper this week and I'm really interested in this     
1:23:33     
space you know like like like like you can you can just insert the thing that     
1:23:39     
you want to talk about and me turn this off here sorry I move away from     
1:23:46     
the cooking sound um you can you can do that and you can even like if you want     
1:23:53     
to if you need a place if you want if you want a place to talk about it in the slack channels that you don't feel if     
1:23:58     
there isn't one necessarily um you can do it there like I think to be to to be self-critical for     
1:24:06     
a moment I think our slack channels get in the way of this pretty     
1:24:11     
strongly because a lot of the slack channels are links that people don't have any context for unless you're deep     
1:24:18     
in the narrative and been paying attention for a while and they're not and I I I say this as someone who's     
1:24:25     
the lab manager who's dealt with us for years like our slack channels are not geared towards people developing     
1:24:31     
projects they just they aren't we're not in the way of it but the reality is the way that they currently operate they're     
1:24:38     
quite more diffusive rather than consolidating and that's been a major issue like we don't we don't really     
1:24:44     
consolidate into okay let's continue to return on this thing continue to turn on this thing continue to turn this thing     
1:24:50     
and build it out into a project like that's just not that's that's that has been heavily outsourced into an     
1:24:58     
individual's own like willpower basically so I think that can I think without if we don't and I don't I don't     
1:25:06     
think that's the way it is or has to be it's just I know that how things operate here tend to be more diffusive to that     
1:25:13     
end so I think we need like I take it upon myself to try to say this as much as I can but also offer that there     
1:25:21     
different ways to do it so I think I think a lot of the merits of what the discussion that's happened in the research management channel is people     
1:25:28     
you know making these efforts towards okay well how can we build out certain things how can we build out certain projects and I feel like I don't just     
1:25:35     
want to say oh well it's on you to to do it and mention it here but much     
1:25:40     
more Ian it's an acknowledgement that we we can we can do differently if not     
1:25:48     
better but just differently ways of offering hey I'm interested in blank     
1:25:53     
prodject I'm interested in getting a pre pre together on this I'm interested in     
1:25:59     
moving uh the the ethics forward I'm interested in moving the codition Futures methods project forward I'm     
1:26:04     
interested in reviewing our you know yeah what's this I keep hearing about developmental breb vehicles and I looked     
1:26:10     
around the GitHub but what is that I'm kind of curious about that I don't know like like those are things that can be brought up so sort of this tension     
1:26:17     
between yes it requires some impetus um but then also I think we can     
1:26:23     
maybe do a better job of offering some cons like structure but then also like     
1:26:31     
um one of the things that that doesn't exist right now and is I'm this is a     
1:26:38     
slightly tangible but also very much like lab admin thing     
1:26:44     
is we previously have had much more intentionally structured     
1:26:51     
like internship stuff like like summer interms or an intership program or an     
1:26:57     
intern joining along with a project that's an established project and and and kind of connecting those dots much     
1:27:03     
more closely than they may have been now like a lot of a lot of people came through for the society ethics     
1:27:09     
technology things in the past uh that presented ultimately at Nick Wick and that was like I'm a little bit pained     
1:27:16     
because I I made an intentional choice not to do that this year and there's not some of that structure right now so it's     
1:27:23     
like oh like I know that's even if people aren't interested in in that topic seeing that structure in place in     
1:27:29     
the lab kind of makes it a little bit or not seeing it makes it like more more     
1:27:35     
mysterious like how does this happen but um I think there's there's things to be     
1:27:41     
improved um in that end as well but I think to go back to the main point of this is sort of if there's something     
1:27:48     
that you want to do in a project     
1:27:53     
sense you're strongly encouraged to do so and if you want specific mentoring on     
1:27:58     
it let us know um either ourselves or connecting with other people in the network we can try to do that so I don't     
1:28:06     
know if we I'm sure you have a lot of things to follow up with that Bradley but that's sort of I think part of the problem is that we put ideas out there     
1:28:14     
and we don't like you know you can grab on to an idea and work it out and that's the part that like we need to do to     
1:28:21     
consolidate things so like if you you know want to do something like do     
1:28:26     
programming exercise or uh write up a paper or blog post that's that's the thing that gets it basically gets you to     
1:28:34     
this consolidation aspect it's like we have this stuff in the channels it's like there sometimes go over it in the     
1:28:40     
meetings and it's there but you know we we can put it together in these artifacts and this is one of the things     
1:28:47     
that I've always dressed is that you're doing these things not just as an exercise and you know showing off but     
1:28:55     
it's also just kind of to bring those ideas together and you know you know if     
1:29:00     
you just like maybe write out like five or six pages of a draft or write out     
1:29:05     
some code to test that idea you know you can always edit it later and you can     
1:29:11     
collaborate and but you have to start somewhere and to start somewhere you need an artifact to show people and say     
1:29:17     
this is what I'm thinking of and I'm bringing together these ideas from the channel and we're kind of putting your     
1:29:23     
own mark on and that's that's where you need to be you know that's what we need more of um and that's why I stress that     
1:29:32     
because it's just kind of hard to uh consolidate things otherwise it's you know it's kind of like the the hidden     
1:29:38     
back end of these channels like this this is where we want to go with it it's     
1:29:44     
we don't really use the phrasing demo or deployer die here in a over     
1:29:51     
sense but because there's sort of a that's a very it's it's it's it's only     
1:29:58     
so useful and it's useful in the context of of certain like productizing or     
1:30:04     
showing to funders and investors but I think maybe a slightly more applicable thing for ours sense is the idea that     
1:30:11     
there has to be the initial creation of an artifact and I like that that's language that I try to use andless ones     
1:30:18     
that I think I'm glad they Bradly used here too but like the creation of the artifact itself the draft talking about     
1:30:25     
it repeatedly that's like where things come into like existence so and it's a     
1:30:31     
tough it's a tough in a weird process but um you know that's that's something     
1:30:36     
that we're we encourage questions and interest and you know if it's     
1:30:44     
about I think like I mean yeah I don't know how this might PR this will help     
1:30:49     
but like the the fact that Jesse said about like uh     
1:30:54     
like kind of a routine repeating of things uh I mean like I've been part of     
1:31:00     
a of a college lab before a group where like it was quite a similar structure     
1:31:06     
there were a lot of volunteer projects going on simultaneously and uh the the way that     
1:31:14     
that was kind of structured was like uh so every time a project was started a     
1:31:19     
new like the squad channel was built for and the relev people were like assigned     
1:31:27     
roles so then like they would always get ping for every message on that channel     
1:31:32     
and uh like one of the things that I think helped a lot was there was a     
1:31:38     
Discord board that kind of used to Ping every week and you know it was just like     
1:31:45     
a time for updates so maybe     
1:31:50     
like like if there is somebody who talks about idea and if there is like maybe I don't     
1:31:58     
know how slack Works in that maybe a thread or a Channel or something and in     
1:32:03     
that way like the people who have that idea can be kind of reminded to interact     
1:32:09     
on it yeah we we've done that we have slack Bots that you can set up and and     
1:32:15     
do that and it's very agile like you know like the AG project management style where you're doing these regular     
1:32:22     
reports which is why G to do meetings every week to to keep people on task and     
1:32:28     
and yeah that's but I mean like what I'm saying is that you need to start somewhere you know you need to you can     
1:32:34     
assign people to something they have to actually do something so that you have a frame of reference to move to the next     
1:32:40     
step so that's that's good you know we need to have a you know we need to think     
1:32:45     
about like how we want to assigner when we start a project how we want to assign thing roles and which which people are     
1:32:54     
best at what and sometimes that's hard too because you know it's hard to know kind of what uh people want to take     
1:33:01     
responsibility for something and you know maybe they're not don't want to do it or maybe they want to change what     
1:33:09     
they doing because they have maybe they're better at something else it's     
1:33:14     
it's kind of hard to get that right so that it makes it highly effective I I do think there's um like     
1:33:24     
for those those who don't quite get my my post slackbot is it basically we had     
1:33:30     
that's what we had like when I first join the lab there was a slack byot and it was it was you know simple like would     
1:33:35     
you do this week you know it wasn't it was the bring is good and then also the     
1:33:41     
return of the mech but um I do think what could be     
1:33:49     
done like I think and this this isn't even like     
1:33:55     
we we we have done this before but it's not an artifact set that we talked about like the contribution guide and how to     
1:34:02     
arel I think could be updated with a bit of the Insight of basically what SAR SAR     
1:34:08     
said but making explicitly saying here's how you could go from an idea to a     
1:34:14     
discussion channel to a regular meeting to a project to pre-print to deliverable     
1:34:19     
like like making it very clear like what is what is our generic road map ATT templated Roat I'm interested in gender     
1:34:27     
of AI LMS and artificial agents uh interacting in world and you know     
1:34:33     
environments or whatever here what do I do okay here's how you do it you can join us here's an existing project we     
1:34:39     
could potentially steer you towards or here's a new space and here are some you know people like just just Road mapping     
1:34:45     
it out because I think I think that's sort of the disparity between people who' been in the lab know that and then     
1:34:53     
us constantly rightfully so like it's it's a very legitimate thing like we have to when we     
1:34:59     
bring people into the lab that should be front and center so     
1:35:05     
and then Den's not here but but we're doing like onboarding things that that we fit into that good thank you     
1:35:14     
what yeah even maybe I don't know if it exists already I have not found it but     
1:35:19     
maybe a list of like all the active projects in the lab with like the people     
1:35:25     
who are involved in it would be starting yeah I     
1:35:34     
don't yeah we don't yeah we don't have like an archive of that at a very granular level like I think the interns     
1:35:42     
have done things and like just just like things that people have done are interested even conversations and things     
1:35:48     
like that um but that's there's been many different attempts yeah at website     
1:35:53     
and the old GitHub archive and everything else um so yes that's that's     
1:36:00     
uh yeah well say yes I have some thoughts about that and I'll visit that     
1:36:05     
revisit that later actually so um yeah I'd like to move on to next thing so     
1:36:13     
thank you Jesse and and Sara for that conversation I think it's it'll be     
1:36:18     
useful to I'm gonna share something here I have a an interesting statistical     
1:36:24     
problem that I'm gonna talk about here and then I'm G to talk about kind of the solution that I'm gonna present so let's     
1:36:33     
let's talk about this this is Daniel lit who's uh a mathematician     
1:36:38     
statistician um and he basically asked this question that had a lot of sort of generated a lot of Buzz and sometimes     
1:36:46     
when people ask questions like this they're not really looking for an exact answer they're looking for how people     
1:36:52     
want to solve the problem and what the answer is but you distill this down to a social media poll and it's you know you     
1:37:01     
don't know why someone answered the way they did so you know there's the sort of     
1:37:07     
initial qu uh question that's asked and then in the replies you get different     
1:37:13     
solutions and then you get this you know kind of thinking about it and implementing your own solution you kind     
1:37:19     
of understand the problem better so that's that's where we are this so remember that there's     
1:37:26     
no right answer there's no single answer to this because we'll talk about some of the options     
1:37:33     
later so the problem is this let's flip a Fair coin 100 times and this is just     
1:37:39     
coin flipping so we know that coin flipping is this activity where you flip     
1:37:45     
a coin and it lands heads or tails and ideally this is a stochastic process     
1:37:51     
with the probability of heads being 50 % and tales being 50% so if we go you know     
1:37:57     
we think about this in terms of a a set of States know we have heads we have     
1:38:04     
tails as are discrete States we have a coin that just gets flipped up in the air and nominally this     
1:38:12     
the probability for the transition here is you know it's 5050 whether you     
1:38:17     
get heads or tails where the the probability of getting heads is 50% the     
1:38:23     
prob ility of getting tails is %. okay so you can think of this as like     
1:38:28     
a a finite State machine or Marian representation which is     
1:38:35     
here and so this means that every time you flip it's a 5050 chance of hitting     
1:38:40     
heads or tails so one might think that you know that that being the case that you end up with a sequence that looks     
1:38:48     
something like this so you have heads Tails heads tails heads Tails heads     
1:38:55     
tails and so on so forth and that it repeats and but then when you actually     
1:39:01     
do this with a coin flip you notice that you don't get this you get runs of     
1:39:06     
States so you get like heads Tails Tails heads heads Heads Tails heads Heads Tails so that     
1:39:16     
changes our probabilities here so it's no longer you know a 50% chance of heads     
1:39:21     
50% chance of tails sometimes you know if we we get these     
1:39:27     
runs where it's like you know sequences of the same state repeated and this is     
1:39:34     
actually quite common and this is actually common in a stochastic process     
1:39:40     
or we might call a true random process because a true random process is not     
1:39:45     
alternating between two states because that's that's actually highly patterned information you think     
1:39:52     
about a random process is something it's hard to predict this is actually very easy to predict and in fact it's not     
1:39:58     
random at all it just it's heads Tails heads Tails so I could predict I could tell you exactly what the outcome should     
1:40:04     
be but this is actually truly random and with a truly random pattern you get     
1:40:09     
these runs but they're there is no characteristic length of the run and they're interspersed within the sequence     
1:40:16     
so this is just a point that I wanted to make on this so let's flip a Fair coin     
1:40:22     
100 times and it gives us the sequence of heads and tails so you get this sort of Quasi     
1:40:28     
random sequence that I showed you uh here in this box and it's generated by this markof     
1:40:36     
process for each heads heads in the sequence of flips so what what we're interested in are these runs     
1:40:43     
specifically these doublets or these runs of two so here I have a Tail's     
1:40:48     
tails and here I have a head's heads and I also have a head's heads here and I have a head heads here so we're     
1:40:54     
interested in these runs of two okay specifically for each HH in the sequence     
1:41:00     
of flips and more specifically we're interested in this heads Heads sequence     
1:41:05     
so for each heads heads in the sequence of flips Alice gets a point so we have     
1:41:11     
two players Bob and Alice Alice gets a point for each head's heads and then for     
1:41:17     
each heads Tails which are these heterogeneous States here which are actually also     
1:41:23     
you know dis uh interspersed in the same way as the the states that we have so we     
1:41:30     
have heads Tails heads Tails head     
1:41:35     
Tails we have that in our sequence as well for each heads Tails Bob does get a     
1:41:43     
point so for the sequence T hhht Alis gets two points and bobby gets     
1:41:48     
one point so you see Alice gets a point every time there's a heads heads and so     
1:41:53     
we have a heads Heads here a heads Heads here so we get two points and then in     
1:41:59     
the uh heads Tails which is here Bob     
1:42:04     
gets one okay we had a bunch of comments here oh uh she can't see anything okay     
1:42:13     
all right I told her to just try restarting all right so who is most likely to win so     
1:42:20     
that's basically our question who's going to get the more who's going to get more points Alis or B and so if you     
1:42:25     
think about these sequences you think okay well maybe there's a clear winner maybe we always get this tendency     
1:42:32     
towards homogeneous States over heterogeneous States or HH over HT so     
1:42:38     
Alice being the embodiment of these homogeneous States gets more points than     
1:42:44     
Bob who is the um embodiment of these heterogeneous States so remember we have     
1:42:50     
Alice and Bob we have um     
1:42:58     
see Alice being this person who gets HH and babo gets points for this     
1:43:07     
HTC okay now there other combinations and we're going to ignore those for now but     
1:43:13     
we'll come back to that in a bit outside of the problem so the poll was who is most likely to win Alice Bob equally     
1:43:22     
likely or results which don't let's not pay attention to that basically more     
1:43:27     
people think Alice will win because the runs of heads heads are more common than     
1:43:33     
heads Tails maybe that's counterintuitive but that's what more people thought than heads tailes being     
1:43:39     
equivalent you know or being more likely and then the equivalents are equally likely most people actually thought that     
1:43:46     
these would be equally likely that you would get heads heads and heads tails and if you look at this uh model that I     
1:43:53     
showed you just I generated this kind of at random that you get these heads heads     
1:43:59     
and tails heads tails and we have three and three in the sequence okay so I mean     
1:44:05     
yeah you might think they're equally likely you might think that Alice has the edge maybe Bob as the edge for     
1:44:11     
people thought that but that's that's a kind of no one has the good answer here     
1:44:16     
and you wouldn't think so because it's a quazite random problem so that establishes our problem so what happened     
1:44:23     
here in this post was that people kind of came up with different explanations for this and it depends on maybe your     
1:44:30     
field or maybe your experience of Statistics so this is Joshua Miller hav     
1:44:36     
been on Twitter for a few good few years nice problem how does it connect to the hot hand so we'll talk about the hot     
1:44:43     
hand in a minute so he's pointing out that Alice wins heads Heads is more     
1:44:48     
common than heads tails and he shows some sort of a proof of this this using     
1:44:54     
conditional probabilities or basian probabilities so there's an approach there's a basian approach to this and     
1:45:00     
then if you do the basian analysis you find that Alice wins at least according to this     
1:45:07     
person uh this is a response here uh again someone points to what they call     
1:45:12     
the hot hand fallacy using three coins tossing sequences an example given the     
1:45:18     
previous tosses H it follows t with higher probability 7 of 12 so you know this we can do this analysis     
1:45:27     
this person here says Monte Carlo which is a technique for sampling random sequences showing both as equally likely     
1:45:35     
so this is a Monte Carlo method so this is where you're just doing this with like kind of a Markov model and     
1:45:41     
generating um likelihood and then this person     
1:45:46     
Yosi uh said it's conditional out of eight possibilities HHH HT H uh hht thh     
1:45:56     
and so forth the first six have sequences HH or HT so what this person     
1:46:01     
is doing is they're generating triplets and they're saying okay if you take the triplets and you sample them uh then you     
1:46:08     
get this you get these sequences that emerge and so you can count those up and get your um answer so there are a lot of     
1:46:16     
as I said there are a lot of different answers to this problem a lot of them have to do with the hot hand fallacy     
1:46:23     
um and so let's talk about that so the hotand fallacy is something that I     
1:46:29     
remember from like my first days in cognitive science where you know I was really interested in the mathematical     
1:46:35     
models and this has a lot to do with kind of cognitive sort of cognitive bias     
1:46:41     
or cognitive social bias so the hot hand is a statistical problem but it's the     
1:46:48     
way we perceive sequences of things in the world and random things and that     
1:46:54     
sort of thing so it has to do with like gambling and basketball and sports so um     
1:47:00     
the hot hand uh previously considered a cognitive social bias is that a person     
1:47:06     
who experiences a successful outcome has a greater chance of success in further attempts so the idea that if you have if     
1:47:13     
you have a player who's hot in basketball if they start making free throws uh consistently you think that     
1:47:20     
okay this person is going to keep making free throws consistently even though they might be on one of these runs where     
1:47:27     
they get you know hits and if you think of hentt as hits and misses they can go on a run of hits and you know baseball     
1:47:34     
is the same thing you go on a run of hits and then you think well they're going to perform at a much higher level     
1:47:40     
but then they regress towards the mean and then they start getting you know they start missing and it turns out that     
1:47:48     
that hot hand or that hot is just kind of a statistical artifact of a random     
1:47:53     
sort of performance and that that performance regresses to a mean which describes their actual performance so     
1:48:01     
this concept is often applied to sports and skill-based tasks it originates from basketball where people shoot pre free     
1:48:08     
throws or three-point shots and they they do really well from time to time     
1:48:13     
and people think that that's a hot streak or a winning streak and sometimes people attach Superstition to it so they     
1:48:20     
like wear the same shirt every game to ensure that their player is continues to be hot uh those sorts of things um so     
1:48:29     
where a shooter is more likely to score if their previous attempts were successful so when you have the hot hand     
1:48:35     
you extrapolate out into the future and say this hot hand will continue and so and but but this is shown to be a     
1:48:41     
fallacy because again it's not anything that's inherent in the skill level it's     
1:48:47     
just this sampling this random sampling of a sequence of hits and misses and so     
1:48:52     
for so this is where we're getting this hot hand idea and so um moreover     
1:48:58     
evidence suggests that only a small subset of players may show a hot hand and among those who do the magnitude or     
1:49:04     
effect size of the hot hand tends to be small so that's consistent with the sampling of the sequence and you know     
1:49:12     
how things regress to the mean so if you sample a bunch of coin flips over 100 flips you tend to end up with 50 heads     
1:49:20     
and 50 Tails but if you Subs example that at like 10 you know 10 flips or     
1:49:26     
five flips you see a bias maybe towards heads or tails and that's perfectly normal for that kind of     
1:49:33     
distribution so this was first described in a paper by gilovich tersi in bone the     
1:49:39     
hotand in basketball paper from 1985 and this study questioned the     
1:49:45     
hypothesis that basketball players of hot hands which the paper defined as the claim that players are more likely to     
1:49:51     
make a successful shot their previous shot was successful the study looked at the inability of     
1:49:57     
respondents to properly understand Randomness and random events and so is     
1:50:03     
kind of thought of as a form of En numeracy at least in the paper uh the three researchers provided an example in     
1:50:10     
which the study regarded the coin toss respondents expected an even short     
1:50:15     
sequence of heads and tails to be approximately 50% heads and 50% Tails so     
1:50:21     
again you know going back to this you everyone expects this this result up     
1:50:26     
here heads tailes Heads Tails heads tailes that's sort of the intuitive choice if you ask people what's the     
1:50:33     
outcome of flipping a point 100 times and they say something like I'll get heads tailes Heads Tails heads Tails 50     
1:50:41     
times and that's but that's not the way it works if you do it empirically this is what happens that's not necessarily     
1:50:47     
intuitive so this is where this hotand fallacy or the gamblers fallacy comes     
1:50:53     
from so you know people have explained this in different ways sometimes it's confirmation bias sometimes you can     
1:51:00     
think of it as a clustering illusion so that you know chance sequences are can     
1:51:05     
seem too lumpy to be something that's drawn at chance so when you see four     
1:51:11     
head heads in a row you think Ah that's a pattern that's there's something there there's something driving that pattern     
1:51:17     
when in fact it's just an artifact of Randomness or quasi Randomness uh uh and     
1:51:23     
so you know this is again there's this other paper from 2018 Miller and Sano     
1:51:29     
which I'm going to talk about in a minute this is actually a new analysis of that original paper by gilovich tersi     
1:51:36     
and Bone and in contrast concluded that there is significant evidence of streak shooting so this actually says that     
1:51:43     
there are streak shoot there is streak shooting that occurs and that there is a statistical basis for the hotand     
1:51:50     
phenomena but you know this is again one of these things that I've never really understood about this problem is that     
1:51:57     
you know of course there's streaks because that's part of this quasi random structure of a of a sequence of hits or     
1:52:04     
misses or heads or tails but you know it's I think what they were getting at the hot hand is that when people see     
1:52:10     
that they think it's like something significant when in fact it's not so the     
1:52:16     
streets occur but the way we interpret them is different so you want to say     
1:52:23     
something yeah like is it there's when we when we're done with     
1:52:29     
this I'll put on my like controversial hat but and I'm I'm this is more of a clarifying question right now     
1:52:37     
um is because I I think I kind of missed     
1:52:42     
something but like our our is what we're currently look our     
1:52:55     
I guess I'm trying to understand the relationship between someone like certain certain things     
1:53:05     
are I guess random like are are are they are people is the message that     
1:53:12     
basketball shooting percentage is random or like it's is it commentary on the the     
1:53:19     
sort of obser like like kind of like throw back to the observational um I forget the name of the title we did a     
1:53:25     
long time ago with Charlotte but like the role of the Observer basically the Observer identifying okay there's this     
1:53:32     
there's they hit five times in a row they must have been really hot here like like this like the basically     
1:53:39     
selection selection of sequence bias as opposed to commentary     
1:53:45     
on like like is it is it just commentary on the observing of the sequence from an     
1:53:50     
sort of Point View view from nowhere kind of VI like okay like in asserting this is the the asserting that this     
1:53:57     
there's something here that they be really hot here from from the point of just looking at the data result versus     
1:54:03     
like is that basically what it's attempting to comment on specifically or is it commenting on     
1:54:09     
okay like I guess I'm I've been a little bit distracted so I apologize but like     
1:54:14     
the basketball repres are a little confusing to me as to like are they saying there's nothing like is it is it     
1:54:22     
commentary that hey uh people don't go on streaks and basketball or like I I     
1:54:28     
guess I'm little confused so my confusing answer is yes and yes and I'll I'll explain what that means so first of     
1:54:34     
all what they're describing is like if you look at a a a performance curve that     
1:54:39     
people tend to train and and reach a level of performance that's sort of typical of what they can do so like     
1:54:46     
people will train and they'll get to a certain level of performance that performance is characterized     
1:54:53     
by um some statistics say like the number of shoots shots that you make and     
1:54:59     
so that's like an accuracy percentage and then within that accuracy though that's an average over time within that     
1:55:06     
accuracy you get runs of like success and failure and so you can indeed go on     
1:55:12     
like hot streaks that are like you hit a bunch of shots and then you don't hit a bunch of shots but that's inherent in     
1:55:19     
your skill level but then when people look at the skill level and try to interpret what's going on you know you     
1:55:25     
can take an an average over a long period of time or you can take shorter averages and say oh there's some they're     
1:55:32     
definitely on a hot streak uh that they're going to continue that forever and then you know that's their level of     
1:55:39     
performance so it's like there's this sort of I don't want to say objective level of performance but there's a sort     
1:55:45     
of statistical summary of skill level at a certain point in time and then there's     
1:55:50     
like this shorter of what people are interpreting or extrapolating out from     
1:55:56     
this uh point you know from from like local sort of information um so let me get on with     
1:56:03     
this so this is the Alice and Bob flipping coins puzzle so this just kind of gives a summary of this post and like     
1:56:10     
many others I intuitively assume the answer would be Alice since her winning segments can overlap well Bobs can't and     
1:56:18     
yet the right answer is Bob so now they've you know this is according to this person they come up with their own     
1:56:25     
solution which is Bob which is actually not the consensus View at all but to     
1:56:30     
figure out this answer let's represent the game as the following markof chain and so they map out a markof chain as I     
1:56:37     
did they actually map it out a little bit more uh you know in a a little bit     
1:56:42     
more complex way where they model all of the states and the transitions required     
1:56:47     
to to make all of those States and then we start at S1 every every time a coin     
1:56:52     
is slipped we move to another state when we reach state three Alice gets a point when we reach State four Bob gets a     
1:56:59     
point and so the question is what are the probabilities that we assign to these Transitions and how do we reach     
1:57:05     
them and so then according to this analysis Bob is the W Bob is the winner     
1:57:12     
and uh so yeah this is this modeled in hasal so again this is another thing     
1:57:18     
where you're trying to interpret these you know basketball shots or coin flips or whatever and people are doing this in     
1:57:25     
different ways depending on their type of analysis this is actually the millerin sanero paper so this is the one     
1:57:32     
from aom metrica um and this is where they do the reanalysis of the original     
1:57:37     
study uh this is where so the abstract of this paper reads we prove that a     
1:57:43     
subtle but substantial bias exists in a common measure of the conditional dependence of present outcomes on     
1:57:49     
streaks and past outcomes and sequential data so we're dealing with sequential data and we're dealing with interpreting     
1:57:56     
these streaks and so in coin flips it's going to be a 5050 probability over a long period of     
1:58:04     
time we can take these short segments and interpret them the way we want but those aren't really going to give us a     
1:58:10     
lot of information the same thing in in shooting in basketball you can make hits or misses there's going to be a certain     
1:58:17     
level of performance but over short periods of time we can observe these Street s and again they don't have a lot     
1:58:23     
of information in but in this paper they talk about the magnitude of the streak selection bias generally decreases as     
1:58:31     
the sequence gets longer so you observe fewer streaks or you know if you look at     
1:58:37     
a short bit of uh a a sequence you get what clearly looks like a streak but if     
1:58:43     
you average it out over a longer period of time the streak kind of melts away     
1:58:48     
but increases in streak length uh and remains substantial for a range of     
1:58:53     
sequence lengths often used an empirical world so we get these streaks of different lengths if you remember the     
1:58:59     
stuff that we talked about with respect to uh avalanches and sandpile avalanches     
1:59:05     
where you get these uh Avalanche events and then they occur at different frequencies over long periods of time     
1:59:12     
and you get this distribution with different length scales that's that's kind of the same thing too it kind of     
1:59:18     
comes from the same place so uh we observe that the canonical study in the     
1:59:24     
influential hotand fallacy literature along with replications are vulnerable to the bias upon correcting for the bias     
1:59:31     
we find that the long-standing conclusions of the canonical study are reversed so this is a sort of taking on     
1:59:38     
that original paper and kind of challenging their uh their findings and     
1:59:45     
again this this uh first paper was gilovich vone and tersi and then this paper Miller and S Jurg     
1:59:52     
is sort of the rebuttal to partial rebuttal to that um but anyways this is     
1:59:58     
the attempt I made of this I made this in Python um and not in um what they     
2:00:05     
were using hasle for this uh this blog post here but I I modeled this in Python     
2:00:12     
basically modeling this these different states coming from a sequence so I generated a sequence of doublets so I     
2:00:20     
have hht uh HT TT and th put them together um and then modeled this and     
2:00:28     
took extracted the states and saw how many times we ended up with our Target States so in this case Alice wins four     
2:00:35     
points to three in this sequence we have to wait for the kernel     
2:00:41     
to run Alice wins four points to three and then this sequence Alice loses     
2:00:49     
three points to one Alice wins three points to two I I keep     
2:00:54     
running this kernel and I keep generating different random sequences it extracts all of the doublets in that     
2:01:01     
random sequence and then I count them up and so as you can see the answer changes each time you run it so it's a Quine     
2:01:08     
random sequence you extract the States you count them up and every time you run it there's a different answer a     
2:01:15     
different winner so Bob sometimes wins Alis sometimes wins so that's an interesting point they didn't talk about     
2:01:21     
this in the post that if you run it again and again and you get these replications that it's not replicable     
2:01:27     
that you Alice sometimes wins Bob sometimes WIS uh the other aspect of this is that     
2:01:33     
you know you can count things other than the hhht state so you can model other     
2:01:40     
states and you get this distribution that changes over time and you can an     
2:01:46     
analyze this with information Theory and you get a you know you get a different answer again with the the different you     
2:01:53     
know every time you generate a new sequ random sequence you get a different answer so I modeled this with a     
2:02:00     
histogram and it shows something interesting from the runs that I did to build this histogram um end up it it     
2:02:08     
looks like if you do I think I don't know how many 20 replicates of this that     
2:02:14     
Alice uh or the HH State occurs sort of in a random     
2:02:20     
distribution so if you look at this how many times um you know you get     
2:02:26     
HH and you look at the distribution of that over 20 runs and then you look at     
2:02:31     
the times that you get th or I guess this is TT and th I'm looking at uh for     
2:02:37     
TT there's a random distribution of uh that state occurring each time you run     
2:02:42     
the simulation and you count up how many times it occurs uh and for th which     
2:02:48     
represents Bob you get a much uh more restricted distribution so you know Bob wins     
2:02:56     
sometimes uh and Alice wins sometimes but the distribution of those States over the 20 runs uh for the TT State     
2:03:04     
it's actually normally distributed for the th State it's not and so I don't     
2:03:10     
know what that means uh it might mean that you get these heterogeneous states that are not distributed in the same way     
2:03:17     
as homogeneous States I don't know but anyways that was my attempt at solving the problem and it was different from     
2:03:23     
everyone else's and so my point here is that uh aside from the hotand stuff and     
2:03:29     
connecting coin flips to the hotand fallacy is that people and you pose a     
2:03:35     
question like that in statistics people are going to solve it different ways Us in different techniques and you get a     
2:03:41     
different answer for all of them pretty much so that's that's what I had to say     
2:03:49     
um on that I don't know Jesse you you want to put your Skeptics hat on or your     
2:03:54     
contrarian hat on um I guess I guess to put on that hat     
2:04:01     
specifically I will say from the point of view like and I'm not I'm saying this I'm saying this as if all the solutions     
2:04:06     
I'm talking about are easy you know and they're not but I     
2:04:12     
think I think some of it points out to like in our ways of speaking about both     
2:04:19     
either like I was thinking about what's the percentage you make like in     
2:04:24     
in in in in one in one particular framing every shot every time you made a basketball     
2:04:32     
SED to shoot make a basket in basketball you     
2:04:37     
only have two options and it's you made it or you didn't so it's always     
2:04:42     
50% there's a 50% somewhere in there depending on how you phrase things now is that the same as sing a     
2:04:50     
coin not necessarily what are the factors that that change it skill level     
2:04:56     
all and all these things about embodiment that we don't really talk about like like we don't have good     
2:05:01     
context for that so and and and a lot of our general discussion about percentages     
2:05:07     
and whatnot is like we just I think I think I think     
2:05:13     
my my my unpleasant hat thing is is pointing out once I feel I feel a little     
2:05:20     
bit uncomfortable like Gary here and I don't really want to but just to kind of go there I'll be like we don't have     
2:05:26     
great ways of conventionally or even even to some extent like in a rigorous     
2:05:32     
academic we don't have the best ways of talking about all the factors that are at play and and even in obviously in a     
2:05:39     
conventional layment sense like the percentage of making the shot or he's shooting 56% from the field today he's     
2:05:45     
shooting 80% you and that that's like that's that getting is some of the interesting takes on     
2:05:52     
this is a relative like climate versus weather like hot in the climate sense     
2:05:57     
yeah but hot like it's a hot climate like okay climate more like an overall skill range like those are things that     
2:06:03     
we sort of have these like weird ways of referencing in general and some of it's bias related and everything else     
2:06:09     
but I guess I guess my point is and I'll let if how wants to say something I'll cut right to that my point is     
2:06:16     
basically there's better there there are ways to to talk     
2:06:22     
about things differently and there's a lot of things that are I think a lot of the work on many of these topics and it     
2:06:28     
kind of it goes back to Phenom knowledge and everything else is like how do we reasonably account     
2:06:35     
for in in a really awkward and Trin analogy just like in the Sarah's talk earlier today well we have this we have     
2:06:42     
this base stuff that we're we're we're amending to every prompt that we send about the person so that the system can     
2:06:49     
you know have this Contex for this the thing we're going to parse like we don't is like what we don't necessarily     
2:06:58     
have the best or consistent uses of that in in a lot of these other spaces so     
2:07:03     
weird Rush comment but I'll turn it over to other discussion yeah Paul had her     
2:07:10     
hand up hi can you hear me     
2:07:17     
yeah can okay hi hi so uh     
2:07:23     
lots of things I wanted to say but I'll try to focus on the one quick point so I don't I'm not interested in statistics     
2:07:29     
at all and everything about get off L but then it's compelling it's of     
2:07:37     
course it has to andv     
2:07:44     
with a number of you know it's just good example and I totally agree with Jess     
2:07:50     
I'm glad Jess what we don't know so I don't know much     
2:08:00     
about presented how everyone is guessing and the they use but what I think I     
2:08:08     
would like invite to reflect on and maybe report in the     
2:08:15     
future useful is what about I mean from where I stand     
2:08:22     
there is not there is no random the the only Randomness in our ability to FP the     
2:08:28     
co consist from physics so I mean and this is a hypothesis I didn't have this     
2:08:35     
but if you flip a coin exactly in the same way with the same force with the     
2:08:41     
same with the same portion and if and the variabl you might have the variables in     
2:08:48     
mind so we don't know how the air then is in that moment and so how we try to     
2:08:54     
factor that impact of one way or another and then if we manage     
2:09:01     
to uh and if manage to replicate exact I would argue     
2:09:08     
that considera able     
2:09:14     
to and I don't know if thises has been made for already while but for me that     
2:09:21     
kind of it's a little bit The Challenge I mentioned it earlier when     
2:09:27     
brought the Avalanche and I thought well really we don't know where the land but that     
2:09:35     
doesn't mean that a way to calculate it means just     
2:09:41     
similarly uh for the basketball I would be very surprised if     
2:09:46     
they W to I mean if you take build a machine the     
2:09:52     
knows exactly where     
2:09:58     
go% and I would be would be surprised if they Haven     
2:10:04     
robot 100% uh because that's the first thing I do and then the question would be is     
2:10:11     
there any random uh no there isn't run is in our     
2:10:18     
ability toate exactly in the same condition the variables is that clear what I'm     
2:10:25     
trying to say brle and let me know if you or anyone     
2:10:31     
has yeah I think there's a lot there's a lot to think about there especially with like uh I get I get from you and Jesse     
2:10:38     
that there's a lot in like a coin flip or a basketball shot that we have to we     
2:10:43     
don't really account for when we do the calculate the probability so we say     
2:10:48     
maybe if we can control say like the embodiment structure of the basketball shot or the minute physical details of a     
2:10:56     
coin flip could we bias it or could we change it from being kind of non-random     
2:11:02     
or something like that and then you can actually see that with the comparison with this coin flip which is sort of a     
2:11:09     
5050 probability that we you know we know from empirical observations is something     
2:11:15     
like a skill level which is above random usually so it's like if I shoot a basketball I I can     
2:11:21     
make so many shots out of so many attempts and that's a skill level and then like that can increase or decrease     
2:11:29     
between players or within a player over time and then you know that's that's     
2:11:34     
something that if of course there's an embodied aspect to that so if you're you     
2:11:39     
know uh change well basketball players will change their shoes whatever that     
2:11:45     
doesn't that doesn't mean go ahead and that doesn't mean that     
2:11:51     
there isn't Randomness in the universe but then I would the next question is     
2:11:57     
that if we can control the flipping of the coin and the basketall and     
2:12:03     
apparently hands I just the L post so is are there phenomena which are random     
2:12:10     
outside our ability to control and probably yes or maybe are we just not     
2:12:17     
able to I mean I don't know for me the fundamental does Randomness really exist or is it     
2:12:25     
our inability to um understand how the universe works     
2:12:31     
that makes right R I am kind of to think the the second so maybe I don't know     
2:12:38     
this is a very profound thing to ask so I'm not expecting any answers but thank     
2:12:45     
you Bradley for for considering you're welcome yeah and Jesse had a comment     
2:12:50     
here where he says it's uh hot hand seems to have an uncomfortable relationship with     
2:12:56     
embodiment environment uh then that strange associations of anthropomorphism around     
2:13:02     
sampling and sequences and also the nature of how a selection process is done and then there's non comfortability     
2:13:10     
about like perception and force control so yeah there's a whole bunch of themes     
2:13:15     
here that are sort of cognitive sciencey and sort of uh you know     
2:13:21     
uh that's the term um epistemological     
2:13:28     
so definitely I mean like you said this started as as really attempts to     
2:13:35     
understand cognitive biases right yeah right like and and so you know when it's     
2:13:44     
it we've got incredible we you know this the stats that people keep on on sports     
2:13:52     
performance are are you know nuts uh uh     
2:13:58     
but the the real question is like somebody's shot you know um three yeah three um I don't even     
2:14:08     
know basketball terms to say this like you know what's the penalty shot anyway     
2:14:15     
you know and you ask people you know to bet on this person versus that person     
2:14:22     
right seeing that history right right they put more money on the person that's     
2:14:28     
that's already scored you know uh and my     
2:14:33     
my uh reinforcement learning Professor Alan nerer back at reads he was focused     
2:14:41     
on reinforcement learning of random sequences oh so so so what he would do     
2:14:48     
you know so what he was trying to trying to get at if you try and press a random you know     
2:14:56     
one or two or you know head header Tails yeah right and um you know to do that     
2:15:05     
for um you know a hundred presses right and then do information     
2:15:12     
theoretic uh measures of that of the sequence you know the sequences that     
2:15:17     
that people generate one they wouldn't be random right so     
2:15:26     
it's like like a person can't replicate that temporal it's the temporal sequence     
2:15:33     
structure that occurs at random you know they end up doing like     
2:15:40     
you're you know showing like the the heads tail heads tail like I'll just I'll just do it like like a really     
2:15:49     
simple uniform but like it's that's actually yeah yeah really structured     
2:15:54     
right and um so his his question which which is a kind of meta RL actually you     
2:16:03     
know was can I reinforce     
2:16:08     
you producing a random sequence and he he loved this because I think his I     
2:16:14     
think his advisor was was hernstein um but you know in classic     
2:16:22     
reinforcement learning uh you should only be able to re what is it you're     
2:16:28     
reinforcing something that should be deter     
2:16:33     
deterministic you know like he was flipping it on its head that you're reinforcing Randomness right um anyway     
2:16:42     
so it's it's really just about that or you know like like the hot hand     
2:16:47     
specifically and then like you said like what are your intuitions about what     
2:16:54     
that's right I I think it I think it's somewhat interesting to think about     
2:17:01     
um Neuro Imaging statistics in terms of the spatial case right so like when we     
2:17:07     
talk about you know random field Theory and and how that's used for multiple     
2:17:13     
comparison correction it's really trying to take into account like like I know     
2:17:20     
with bum for I know that you're going to you're going to see you know 5% activation or     
2:17:26     
whatever whatever you want to have as your threshold by chance if I've got say 10,000 uh voxels that I'm doing     
2:17:34     
hypothesis tests but I don't expect that those those voxal those random spots     
2:17:42     
will be all at a cluster right they should be like like you know the yeah     
2:17:49     
and and so so the these these kind of cluster analyses that again like like have     
2:17:56     
interesting interactions with spatial scale right yes which which I think you're     
2:18:03     
sign of kind of seeing in the in the you know the the the Monte Carlo simulations     
2:18:09     
there yeah with you know three coins and you know Etc like yeah any yeah yeah     
2:18:16     
it's it's conversation and and it's always I mean I I always think about     
2:18:22     
like when I when I don't like these these problems I always think about the     
2:18:28     
Monty Hall problem go I I I I should not     
2:18:33     
trust my intuitions yeah even when I like like     
2:18:40     
I'm I'm consciously trying to be Vasan I should recognize that like there's     
2:18:46     
there's subtleties there that really can f off yeah yeah so in the book when I     
2:18:51     
showed the sequences that was generated by Python's generator but the thing about generating random sequences is     
2:18:58     
that we do this with a computer we're approximating a random sequence and people haven't really been able to     
2:19:05     
figure out how to generate truly random sequences using a computer so we're just approximating them yeah this this is     
2:19:13     
particularly close to home because because my my analysis thesis work was all on binomial mixture models right so     
2:19:19     
I was doing car simulations of these and and and then the multinomial cases and     
2:19:26     
yeah it was all about these these you know if we scan the same person say     
2:19:32     
eight times and and then we we do the processing of each eight you know each     
2:19:37     
eight runs separately but then then look at the     
2:19:43     
same voxel across those eight runs right how How likely is it that that voxel is     
2:19:50     
is is been uh labeled as active or you know significant yeah and yeah it was     
2:19:57     
all yeah all specifically about this a brief comment for me is going to be     
2:20:04     
basically I I think there's a time when I turn into probability a lot     
2:20:11     
more um and and basically Bas what Morgan was talking     
2:20:18     
about probability versus like spatial distribution and how that like the embodiment influences on that as I go     
2:20:27     
like I just no one no one like I guess I'm I guess I'm just in sort of     
2:20:32     
a meta researcher like something I was never told growing up     
2:20:41     
was we have a lot of authoritative speaking about very specific things in     
2:20:46     
probability and statistics and machine learning and Science and stuff now relatively     
2:20:51     
but really emphasizing these aren't totally matur     
2:20:58     
fields that that have no more questions left in them and that are all like that like I feel like there's such a there     
2:21:05     
was this presentation that things are super known and done we don't have question about this stuff anymore and     
2:21:11     
it's like it's just not not the case um like like there's there's work to be     
2:21:18     
done and maybe maybe there's an imp possibility of it in the sense of what a human from a fixed perspective can     
2:21:26     
comprehend sure but but that that's not     
2:21:31     
the whole story so that that's I guess I guess like when I'm when I'm dealing     
2:21:38     
with people when I'm like doing people from like you know my other     
2:21:45     
like from my University undergradu from my alma Mo talk to me about stuff like that's really what I try to convey to     
2:21:50     
them the most is like you're you're not not not just like radical like oh yeah you know you     
2:21:57     
can you know think for yourself in like Dead Poet Society sort of way yes that but also     
2:22:03     
like really this sort of rigorous and sober questioning of what the level of     
2:22:11     
maturity of a lot of these things are and why and where are they in it so it     
2:22:17     
kind of goes back to Frontier map stuff for me like like like I'm I'm not I guess I'm not saying the word frontier     
2:22:22     
map here or in many of my updates but that's actually a major thing with Joo that I'm still working on too in sort of     
2:22:28     
trying to in one sense you could say Frontier map is an attempt to offer that context or like how do you coming from     
2:22:35     
nowhere coming from very little very minimally information about something to     
2:22:41     
not to get some of the conics I'm talking about so oh that's my closing soap box for today but yeah thank you     
2:22:49     
for that yeah and then Paul mentioned that I would like to argue that Randomness may not quite be what it is     
2:22:55     
made out to be we need work on understanding Randomness yeah and then uh Greg chayon who's a mathematician he     
2:23:03     
did a big a book on exploring Randomness which is a great book he's done a a     
2:23:09     
number of other piec he does a lot of work in algorithmic information Theory and things like that which are very     
2:23:15     
close to understanding Randomness and and that sort of thing so uh yeah that     
2:23:20     
that's always that's also good reading to understand and yeah we don't really understand Randomness mathematicians do     
2:23:27     
a lot of work research on it in pure mathematics and Applied Mathematics so yeah yeah and and super super important     
2:23:36     
in terms of those Monte Carlo methods you know like like the the random seed     
2:23:41     
generators and and Etc you know um yeah just really interesting points yeah all     
2:23:49     
right well let's leave it here and um thanks for attending and thanks for uh     
2:23:54     
putting things in the slack and U talk to you next week PE Goodbye by thanks

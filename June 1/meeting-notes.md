i was going to ask about judy fan yes      
Jes (OREL) says:     
re morphcomp... so this is like a working group that published this ebook? It doesn't seem to be an event, but I'mnot sure what it is, or the group is?      
Jes (OREL) says:     
second... I have "some beef" with something that comes up in academicy-things , that might fit for this ebook and other events I 've attended.      
Jes (OREL) says:     
which I may have a constructive rant about if I have a few moments to do so      
Jes (OREL) says:     
that monologue perhaps should be entitled "Jesse Has. Hard Time THat Every Conference Isn't Designed TO be Like one of the old Macys Conferences"      
Jes (OREL) says:     
'with the help of the community we clarified the purpose'

## TRANSCRIPT
0:03     
hello stucks right now what's that in Starbucks right now oh yeah I can see I     
0:09     
forgot my headphones so okay I'm G have to be careful because     
0:16     
no I mean it's not it's not a problem but obviously if there are people around me they can hear you I mean not that you     
0:22     
know anyone's yeah yeah I know it's fine we're just waiting for a few more people     
0:28     
to show up we'll get started hi hello or else can you hear me yeah     
0:37     
yeah you're doing such important work here even if I'm exhausted busy I plan     
0:43     
not to attend I just open and say hi and try not to engage with this braining     
0:49     
conversation much yeah that's fine how is every how is everything     
0:55     
going pretty good pretty good yeah     
1:00     
how do you focus with your with your mental overload rad and same     
1:09     
everyone I mean you know there's strategies you know you take breaks uh when you need to not necessarily like     
1:16     
binge for like six months and then take you know I mean I usually kind of do it during the week just take breaks from it     
1:23     
uh you know try to keep on top of things but don't try to get obsessed over things and uh we've tried to also yeah     
1:32     
we've tried to also segment the meetings more like uh after the fact so like we     
1:39     
have a lot of uh videos that you know we have we have all these meetings and it's like we can segment out like different     
1:46     
features and WR blog posts I've done that in the past where like if we have     
1:51     
an important discussion that goes over a couple weeks um I will like write up a     
1:57     
post and like take like clips from those meetings and say this is this discussion     
2:03     
and just kind of highlights those parts and you we've done that for a couple of them in the last year so     
2:11     
that's always good too because doesn't you don't have to Wade through a bunch of things to get to some good     
2:17     
discussions and always good to Target what you're thinking if you're thinking of some idea that you encountered this     
2:23     
happens with like literature reviews as well you can like have it s of queued up     
2:29     
he say oh yeah we had the discussion about uh some sort of computation I'll     
2:35     
have to go back and look and so you know that's like kind of postprocessing all     
2:40     
of this so that's that's kind of another thing I haven't done it as much um as     
2:46     
I'd like to but um you know there're just ways you have to reduce the bandwidth that you or I guess sometimes     
2:54     
things are noise sometimes things are signal and you have to find the signal in there and like focus it yeah and and     
3:00     
that takes and that takes processing doesn't it and I don't know what your the rest of the week looks like for you     
3:06     
people me that I you know like the rest of the universe my brain expands and     
3:13     
contracts yeah and so when I when it's expanding I just     
3:19     
can take in a lot of information and then suddenly it reach saturation he     
3:24     
said wait a minute I need to squeeze everything out focus on the brain takes out     
3:31     
and then normally when I'm in the expansion I have more listening     
3:36     
time and then when I need to work on something I I need to try I cannot use     
3:43     
theand taking more I need just that close down the channel so it depends a     
3:50     
little bit when you know normally after a deadline after all my deadlines are met you know but at the moment I'm in a     
3:58     
situation     
4:05     
I haven't managed to merge all my interest     
4:10     
into my profession so I this is why I'm an independent researcher so basically I     
4:17     
pursue my personal interest as much as I see it but then I feel like there are     
4:23     
other aspects I should be work I should take care of my he I go     
4:30     
out for so every anyway so this is now all of my excuses for when I'm not going to be     
4:37     
here and then uh yeah well I I want to I Really value this uh     
4:48     
thing no that's good yeah people that's one of the things about our model is that people participate as they can so     
4:55     
we do things like you know we have the meetings live and we have YouTube recordings and then you know we have the     
5:02     
postprocessing of that and we have the same for other meetings and you know hopefully people get what they need out     
5:08     
of it because it's not easy to so yeah during the week you had the Friday     
5:14     
meeting which J and H tried to invite me to but I couldn't I mean I still haven't finished     
5:21     
reading everything that was shared on this channel you know Morgan pointed me     
5:26     
to some possible viiz I have I'm trying to get so I take more CH     
5:34     
apart from these two meetings you also have a Monday right with the de worm yeah yeah we have the Monday meeting     
5:41     
dorm we have Friday open source we have this meeting and then sometimes we have     
5:47     
Wednesday and Thursday meetings uh for other topics as well so let you know it     
5:54     
gets busy but like we try to cover a you know we try to like cover a lot in this     
5:59     
meeting very generally and then go to those meetings and do things that are more focused so yes this is learning     
6:07     
yeah yeah all right yeah yeah please ask     
6:15     
questions as we go along so it's always good to get     
6:20     
feedback from people on things how things are organized how to strategies     
6:25     
for finding things that's sort a way finding strategy and information that's     
6:32     
you know that's important that's an important skill yeah welcome to the meeting we'll get started uh well     
6:39     
Hussein and Jess and Paula uh and so yeah we this week uh we     
6:46     
had our Monday meeting which was the beginning of the coding period for D.A     
6:51     
worm uh you know we had uh our Friday     
6:56     
open source meeting so Hussein talked about some of the things he's working on with     
7:02     
multiphysics and some of the software that you need for that sort of a thing and you know some of the challenges     
7:08     
around building features into software academic software and otherwise and I     
7:14     
just went back through the meeting and I was like this is a pretty good impromptu session talking about like feature     
7:21     
building features into things um I I teach project management as well yeah I     
7:28     
teach project management as as well and it's uh it has like over overlap with     
7:33     
that where we have this unit on feature building you know how do you like when you have a product a project you you     
7:40     
know you'll build some sort of product and then that product will have features and how do you know what the features     
7:45     
are how do you keep your features you know sort of sustainable and how do you manage all     
7:52     
that so it's it's really interesting to see that I think that's an important part of Open Source but anyways we had     
7:58     
that meeting and then of course this meeting and we're still on break from our cybernetics inter cognition Futures     
8:05     
meeting starting up this month we'll start with those again and it's you know we'll pick up on     
8:12     
that so yeah and then I actually I wanted to point this out I put a message in the cybernetics slack channel uh     
8:20     
about the paper that we have uh that's due soon uh now I talked to Adam saffron     
8:26     
about this and he said that you know it's it's the initial deadline was June 1st and you know we can submit our     
8:33     
paper uh you know up I think up until October 1 I don't want to spend that     
8:39     
much time on this I want to get this out and reviewed but I did uh get put the     
8:44     
finishing touches on a draft so this is our uh cybernetics paper that we're     
8:51     
working on for the special issue of Royal Society interface focus and so they have the special issue     
8:59     
on sort of like on AI and World models and different approaches to that I think     
9:05     
they're trying to solicit uh people who have a very diverse set of backgrounds to sort of     
9:11     
give an overview of what would constitute a global model for AI if AI     
9:17     
had a model that it could reference all sorts of things in the world you know     
9:23     
not just a training set but like have a conceptual World aside from its training     
9:29     
set what would that look like and what kinds of principles can we bring to bear to     
9:35     
sort of get at how to do that so what we decided to do is to talk     
9:40     
about uh the ever good regulator theorem and this is something from the cybernetics literature um Ashby wrote     
9:49     
about it in around 1970 and it's not something that's been     
9:55     
kind of uh followed up on very much as a concept the concept is sort of was     
10:01     
established and then people and it did their own thing sort of adapted from it but it never really came back into     
10:08     
fashion and so what we're doing in this paper is we're bringing it back into fashion we're bringing it back into     
10:14     
fashion in at least two ways maybe three ways uh the first way is to go over and     
10:19     
say you know this idea of good regulation is sort of the Cornerstone of     
10:24     
things like control theory and some of the other um models for S of engineering     
10:33     
optimization and we can apply that to AI uh in World     
10:39     
models uh the second one is where you know you have these sort of phenomena     
10:44     
that are uh out of distribution or far from equilibrium and we can model those     
10:50     
things uh you know as sort of things in the world that you can't necessarily     
10:55     
grab from training data alone you need to have a model but need to have a dynamical model you can't have something     
11:01     
like a symbolic model and we don't get into this too much in the paper but the symbolic models of course are sort of     
11:09     
you know if you think about like AI in the past you know you would have training data there's that view that you     
11:16     
know you just need to throw enough data at the model and it will learn anything and of course you know that's probably     
11:22     
not true there are a lot of high level Concepts that it needs to learn and so people have just said well let's build     
11:28     
symbolic models and symbolic Frameworks and use that and what we're arguing here is kind of like     
11:35     
not that at all we're saying that there's this sort of uh structure this     
11:40     
feedback structure or this sort of regulatory structure that exists that     
11:45     
allows us to um you know model not only like from a training set but from these     
11:52     
kind of far from equilibrium and out of distribution behaviors so this you know     
11:58     
this is just kind of the latest version of this uh it'll probably be uh adapted     
12:05     
and I'm looking I'm soliciting comments um and I want to get a sense of     
12:11     
you know how you know maybe we need to change some things maybe we need to uh I     
12:17     
don't want to add too I don't want to add anything because we're at the word limit so we have an 8,500 word limit and     
12:23     
it's very hard to maintain yourself within that word limit as you can imagine you know what we what what's     
12:30     
here is like very wide ranging and there are a lot of threads in here that you could unpack     
12:36     
and that's not really the point of this paper the point of this paper is to go through the     
12:42     
egrt to go through some of the aspects of what they call good regulation from     
12:47     
the good regulator theorem um you know kind of thinking about that then thinking about specific     
12:54     
cases toy models where we can idealize or what things that challeng idealized     
13:00     
good regulation so things that are non-ar Marian things that are out of     
13:05     
distribution out of equilibrium so forth and then we have um let's see then we     
13:13     
have to relate this uh I got to change that spelling uh we have to change the     
13:19     
egrt or we have to uh adapt egrt to some of these machine learning and     
13:26     
reinforcement learning models which of course don't think about that but they have     
13:32     
relevance um and then of course we need to think about embodied continuous intelligence because that's kind of     
13:39     
where you would go with the egrt and um you know it kind of lends     
13:45     
itself to that kind of an approach and then you know how do we connect good regulation to intelligence     
13:52     
so we have a lot of definitions of intelligence in the uh literature right now none of them are very good good you     
14:00     
know if we think about what is intelligence we back up from all the AI hype and you say what is intelligence     
14:06     
and answer is not easy to understand like you know we have definitions of intelligence from psychology and from Ai     
14:15     
and it's not clear that we know what it is nor do we really understand how the models that     
14:22     
we're building relate to that so it's like you know if something is intelligent how do you know I     
14:29     
mean the earlier in the paper we talk about good regulation is this thing that     
14:35     
kind of exists as you know it when you see it well that's not good enough for     
14:41     
something that you want you know you want to have a scci some scientific riger around and the same holds true for     
14:46     
intelligence so a lot of definitions of intelligence focus on sort of these human Centric     
14:52     
traits these you know different features maybe of a machine learning model they're not really what we would call     
14:58     
theor ically sound they're not sound principles that you can apply to say artificial systems or uh that are very     
15:06     
clear to sort of attach parameters to or or measurements and so this is where you     
15:13     
know we don't really give a lot of time to it necessarily but it has it's put in     
15:19     
there now my so this is the paper it's kind of at the page limit there some     
15:24     
things that you know obviously there needs to go through maybe another editing cycle or more     
15:30     
but I want to get uh to a point where we can submit it and you know get it in uh     
15:36     
probably as soon as possible maybe in the next month or so so if we can uh look at that and make     
15:42     
comments um that would be great and you know uh I I do need to write up a sort     
15:48     
of a supplemental materials for it as well because that's necessary but um     
15:54     
yeah I think and I think Adam's really excited about it and he's excited about     
15:59     
maybe working with the group more uh you know collaboration okay yeah so yeah Jess     
16:06     
it's fine I have a question so what are the what's that sorry I should haveed my     
16:13     
hand it's okay I should have raised my hand I'm being     
16:19     
understood the look are the diagrams represent I have lost a page     
16:27     
there I mean the there are some graphs     
16:33     
yeah there some what do they stand for oh well     
16:39     
these are just like uh let's see this is a description of the everg good     
16:44     
regulator theorem so this is kind of how they've described it in the literature obviously not um that like it's it's     
16:53     
very it's very hypothetical so you have this uh system you have a regulator our     
17:01     
system s and the regulator tries to model the     
17:07     
system and the idea is that the regulator on page 11 right page 11 uh     
17:12     
this is actually page four page 11 this one is Page four P sorry I was referring     
17:20     
I those I understand is the one on page 11     
17:25     
is do a bit information if you could a very quick one I just     
17:30     
want to know what I couldn't I cannot make out the others I understand what they represent this     
17:36     
one this one here so these are yeah these are graphs I'm going to write up     
17:41     
some supplemental materials basically one of the toy models is the sort of avalanche model and what I'm doing is a     
17:48     
modeling avalanches in a uh you know in a Time series and those Avalanches is     
17:54     
showing that the Avalanches occur at different times over the course of the sample and then you know you have all     
18:01     
these different uh change this uh and then you can model it in different ways     
18:08     
the Avalanche like the snow uh yeah there's a there's a model in physics called the Avalanche model     
18:14     
which is uh where you have like you can build a a pile like you can build a pile     
18:21     
of sand grain you drop sand greens down and you build this pile of sand and then at some point the sand pile gives way     
18:29     
and it collapses and it does this at different rates so as you build up the sand pile part of it collapses and you     
18:35     
can measure the collapses you can measure the the uniform adding of grains     
18:41     
and you can get these distributions that are uh not predict easily predictable in     
18:46     
advance so these are things where know these are systems that are sort of     
18:51     
stochastic and Cha and and I guess quazi chaotic but they're not uh particularly     
18:58     
predictable by say like a machine learning model and so go through this uh and uh you know     
19:05     
kind of gives you know some idea of how the good regulator theorem relates to     
19:11     
this so that's that's what this graph is um and you know yeah I don't have like     
19:18     
the full description in the paper I'm going to put it in like a supplemental materials so that's why it's it's kind     
19:24     
of sparse here but it'll it'll improve but that's that's that's what that's     
19:29     
what's going on there yeah no problem so yeah so just     
19:35     
said uh oh yeah yeah no problem and yeah     
19:41     
welcome your comments on yeah we're we'll probably I know Jess     
19:46     
is busy right now we'll probably work on that over the next month or two and get that out by I don't know I I've got some     
19:56     
stuff to do in August so maybe before that at the very latest um so yeah Hussein says we can     
20:04     
talk a bit today about the ethical considerations opposed to neuros stimulation we can do that in a little     
20:11     
bit uh Jess says uh I will be listening in for a while if you can wait until     
20:16     
next week I'll have a lot more to go through fully yes so take your time on that Jess looking forward to the paper     
20:23     
Al more with Adam to yeah so we'll yeah we'll see where we go with that it'll be     
20:29     
fun that'll be fun and an interesting set of collaborations there     
20:34     
so basically I would love to be able I would love to be able to give feedback on this paper but because it's such a     
20:40     
long V and it very looks like very dense and there a few things which I probably need     
20:46     
to look up um I I as much as I want to     
20:53     
um I may not be able to be very useful to you now because I have a deadline on     
20:59     
the 30th of June uh and I haven't even started and I'm writing the paper Al so     
21:05     
I'm looking at you you have two three months to finish this wonder wonder     
21:12     
orig so but as a whole uh if you're looking for feedback     
21:18     
rly from other people like who may want to take quick look without having to     
21:26     
read it all up don't have the brain power maybe to have a few uh bullet     
21:33     
points yeah uh like 10 bullet points of what each of the main section says and     
21:39     
could help us trigger some uh feedback without having to do the reading you see what I'm saying there are some things     
21:46     
like for example you talk about regulator I I you talk about regulator and there are some things I like to     
21:52     
bring up but without having a very clear one shot understanding of     
21:58     
what is the question then I'm not sure whether what I want to say is relevant to you and I don't want to waste your     
22:04     
time so um maybe in one sentence say what is this paper going for to start     
22:12     
with do you have it in one sentence uh not off the top of my head     
22:18     
but yeah that's the problem that we have so but even it could be useful for you in     
22:25     
the doing your own R what the and for anyone want so that's my only contribu     
22:31     
this if you could make a bullet point I can look at the bullet point and say okay I think this could be     
22:38     
something yeah that's that I can do that I can do but reading I have to do this     
22:46     
other stuff yeah yeah yeah I have to uh create     
22:54     
some promotional materials as well too so that would be helpful where you know you kind of say what the paper like if     
23:01     
people want to read the paper or you want to make it relevant to them say what is it about and how does it you     
23:07     
know people do these these posts because I'm interested in this is General system     
23:13     
General System Theory right syst the related and I'm interested in it I may     
23:18     
even be able to say one or two intelligent things but there is so much uh to to say to know before and yeah it     
23:27     
was as I look for that when you have that I'll be able to give you some intelligence respon and to     
23:33     
your question what is intelligence yeah I you know my answer is which could be relevant here I don't know is like of     
23:40     
course it's very complex it's not one thing but intelligence response is a a     
23:46     
marker for whatever that is so you know I can give you an     
23:53     
intelligence I need to have intelligence input     
23:59     
and uh I don't know how that play your set up but here I to get intelligent     
24:07     
input I mean if you take the example of your paper you have a lot of intelligent inut there but I don't have the     
24:14     
capacity so these are the things I you know     
24:20     
intelligent signal needs to be delivered in a way that the whoever you're trying     
24:26     
to deliver it to can can uh process it so that they can respond     
24:34     
that I don't know if this fits     
24:40     
what yeah that's that sounds great yeah I know I get I get it it's you know it's     
24:46     
something that like in the like when people talk about machine learning in particular that whole     
24:52     
conversation people I don't have kind of lost their way on that like they'll talk about how     
24:59     
like algorithms are exhibit sort of super intelligence or sentience and in the literature at least     
25:06     
there isn't a lot that is uh useful like it doesn't relate back to say like     
25:12     
people or animals or living systems or you know just kind of like a almost like     
25:18     
a self-contained thing or if it recognizes something then it must be you     
25:23     
know intelligent and it it's just uh the conversation there is not very well     
25:29     
rooted in uh something rigorous you know there's there's a lot of stuff in the     
25:35     
history of psychology as well where it's kind of uh troubling some of the things that people have sort of the ways people     
25:42     
have viewed intelligence but it's it's also there you know some ideas there that are kind of need to be synthesized     
25:50     
good ideas but they're not like uh there's no synthesis there and so it's     
25:55     
really kind of a hard thing to cast your net around and I hope someone actually     
26:01     
puts together like a submission on just definitions of intelligence we'll see     
26:07     
what those look like the other defin or the other submissions to the special issue but if you if you have the special     
26:15     
isue call if it's still open I may have some material but you know I don't have enough hands and I W up I the the point     
26:24     
with the I mean it's like you have     
26:29     
um the abilties so let's assume n AI     
26:35     
uh it depends if it's program or if it's not program if it's program it doesn't     
26:42     
matter how stochastic it is it's still designed to to     
26:48     
follow a process which is intentionally expressed by whoever designed but then     
26:55     
what I think people are coming out with it's interesting this this     
27:04     
AI was     
27:10     
IDE and these are to Paradigm and I personally do not see the for the     
27:17     
second because um we have humans who are come     
27:23     
up with and they are ref they are show they     
27:30     
are     
27:37     
not now we want to create     
27:43     
Mach and then what why do that we have     
27:49     
every every human being cre intelligence is uh     
28:19     
yeah yeah I'm just taking some here yeah that's that's good that's good     
28:26     
you understand what I say yeah yeah yeah so we have and you say     
28:32     
AI even we don't you     
28:38     
knowell but how do you know how you Ai     
28:43     
and kind of so that would be could be useful to     
28:49     
have that frame whatever you're talking but I that and if you have a     
28:58     
that you like to share I doubt I when is the deadline uh I think it's October 1st     
29:05     
now so yeah oh I'll send you the     
29:14     
call yeah I yeah yeah I'll send you the call see     
29:22     
see if it's something that uh Jesse going to say     
29:34     
something     
29:39     
um I'm I'm not going to say a whole lot I'll just     
29:46     
say uh yes to to what you said about intelligence is and yes like it     
29:52     
it's you know for context for people who are just seeing the paper for the first time like there     
29:59     
we've been talking about these a lot of this I mean some of this is is like a really deep theme that we've been     
30:06     
talking about since I joined the lab um and sort of a an extension from like     
30:11     
commition features and cybernetics uh the F of the breeding groups that have kind of popped up     
30:17     
around those topics so it's you know if     
30:23     
it doesn't if it seemed like there's a lot of missing context think the context is from     
30:29     
uh those other things that have been happening for a long time so um     
30:34     
just for for those who are not not seeing that this partly where it comes     
30:41     
from it's it's a really nice opportunity to push these ideas forward that we've     
30:47     
kind of been talking about and like egrt stuff and and all right you know even     
30:53     
even seeing going through it here I guess um well one one practice question that's coming up like for making edits     
31:02     
do you I think we had this in a in a Google Document also do or do you want     
31:09     
do you want edits interview to happen on that Google Document or somewhere else I guess uh yeah we might do it on the     
31:16     
Google Doc um I don't I didn't put the link in there because I wanted to yeah     
31:22     
but I mean I can access give people access to the Google Doc if that's where they want to put their comments because     
31:28     
it's easier to do that like integrate it that way than to do it like by going back and forth between a document     
31:37     
yeah you know after kind of like after next week I'm I don't     
31:43     
have the bandwidth right now to do it I have actually think I have the time but I don't have the bandwidth all um but     
31:52     
that will change shortly so I kind of been enjoying um     
31:57     
the the idea of having to like go through that and like just yeah a lot of like suggestion word things would be     
32:04     
great but also like it's kind of it's tough because     
32:11     
um like I don't know if Adam was push the deadline back or not but there were     
32:16     
there were some things that you alluded to in the discussion now that like I definitely want to do more with um that     
32:23     
we have talked about like the intelligence stuff um and you also alluded to     
32:30     
um let's see uh you know like like terms in     
32:37     
Psychology not being well synthesized over time and that's that's sort of     
32:43     
like I guess de facto a little bit of what we've tried to address from cognition features or what we're you     
32:49     
know what we're slowly doing like we kind of had a mandering path of that in the method project but that's definitely     
32:56     
what I um you know I'm I'm I'm doing like a lot of     
33:02     
the some of the other like working groups I'm making with Pro are kind of attempting to     
33:08     
synergistically explore those spaces like like there's an easy way of saying it     
33:14     
is uh the models that we have and how they were made and what they what what     
33:21     
they kind of speak to like I think it was a very I think there's a lot a lot to draw from the analogy that there oh     
33:28     
in the machine learning space it's like this you know you have there sort of this particular takes on like the int     
33:34     
whatever else is going on and um     
33:40     
it's in in a in a in a similar way um how do I say this     
33:49     
concisely I think there's not been a     
33:55     
lot I you know I I was very to to kind of come to a point and and reference     
34:02     
something that's a little bit more tangible and accessible um you know let's talk     
34:10     
about the cognitive science project and kind of the attempt to put it around     
34:16     
comput like computation it was kind of this you know going to be this not one ring one ring     
34:23     
to rule them all but this this sort of thing that was going to     
34:29     
bring bring it all together and it's like as long we could get it to the sort of you know the mind is the computer or     
34:35     
even like the M voting compendium mind is machine and and it's it's sort of     
34:42     
that's this one major thrust of like cognitive science is this way there's a sort of mechanistic     
34:49     
approach to what that and that's fine but also     
34:54     
like I'm I'm very interested in     
34:59     
sort of what are the boundaries and what are what's the proper line of demarcation for a lot of the things that have been happening in in that space and     
35:07     
I think it some of it touches upon the role of computation uh and and the likeness of a     
35:14     
machine to to that but then also like there's this really important dubils     
35:21     
into you know the things that kind of morg was talking about I think last time like you know oriz and H in emulation     
35:29     
and go into that way and what you know how we're     
35:35     
interpreting to that level um uh but ALS but still furthermore there's sort of     
35:41     
these paradigms that just aren't um the the Nuance isn't quite there so     
35:50     
even at one I'm kind of starting to break it down in my mind is like broad broad areas of Investigation on this     
35:55     
topic that are interesting to me are sort of there's a supplied Arena like     
36:03     
um a lot of the stuff are basically making sort of the DSM project is sort of evolving as sort of a broader mental     
36:09     
health working group which I think is a much more applied mesh point of the agent in the     
36:16     
environment right what's happening there what's happening in ch of History what's happening going back in time in the     
36:22     
reality but then also I guess I'm seeing Cent Futures as um and this is this is     
36:28     
you know to to be to be laid out much more on the places than not now but     
36:33     
condition futures um comparatively as more of a okay well     
36:40     
almost like an engineering approach or what's happening like what what are the     
36:45     
structures of how they work in in a in a more abstracted way of of of like the     
36:53     
quol mind or cognition cognitive things and I feel like     
36:58     
there's like a much better view of all the stuff is is one where those two you     
37:05     
know aspects are much more flesh fleshed necess fleshed out but like spoken about     
37:10     
in a way that's much more self-aware of each other and we're looking like we looked at like PES we looked at all     
37:16     
these people who are you know uh like     
37:21     
kind of paused awkwardly at the middle of Tom froes eruption Theory which is a Zone take on you know getting back and     
37:28     
forth between these other things and and the non-dualism of XYZ and all that     
37:36     
stuff and and you know like that's all important but I I feel like     
37:41     
there's you know it's it's and you you can probably     
37:47     
hear my voice like a little bit of all these pent of things that I'm not talking about Miss Futures right now and     
37:53     
so forgive me for that but it's the sense of you know I I think     
37:58     
there's very important ways to look rigorously and and and consider like not     
38:07     
just in a in a paradigmatic critical or critiquing way but sort of     
38:15     
what's not just what's at the table but sort of like what are the tables that should be in the dining hall and how do     
38:21     
you want to arrange them to each other so they get everybody at the same table but you know if you arrange the tables     
38:27     
on nice way you could have you know the proper much like things are much more     
38:32     
facilitating in conversation if they're done a certain way versus not and I think at a higher level a very high high     
38:38     
high level that's kind of what we're getting at so I know I'm uh soap boxing     
38:45     
a bit about it but that's just some recent uh pent up ideas about all that     
38:51     
so yes thank you for sharing that for and I really look forward having to that     
38:57     
to wait the before I can so yeah yeah well I didn't want to bring it up I did     
39:02     
want to bring it up because you know just to make sure people were aware of it uh so yeah we're going to be working     
39:08     
on it more uh over time and getting it finished up you know uh I think we've     
39:14     
been making some pretty good progress on it over the spring and this is really the product of a lot of these     
39:20     
conversations and these in these group meetings so this is what we do in the group meetings we talk about these ideas     
39:26     
and they kind of float the air and we want to bring them down to like some sort of synthesis some sort of like you     
39:33     
know actionable items and this is kind of one example of that how we're of shaping that those discussions and     
39:40     
putting some flesh on the bones and I want what I want to do though as well from some of these themes because this     
39:46     
is a paper that has a lot of themes that are in there is to sort of work out maybe some things that we think are good     
39:53     
you know uh we have a page limit here and in a paper you don't want to like throw everything into the paper because     
40:01     
you don't want to have like this 40,000 word paper but you do want to have you know     
40:08     
some themes and then there always some themes that you feel like you need to develop more so those are the things     
40:14     
that you might take and say we're going to write another paper on this like PA's     
40:19     
idea about you know different things about models and intelligence and that     
40:25     
um that would be like an interesting paper we wouldn't have to necessarily submit it to this special issue but we     
40:31     
could submit it somewhere else down the line or you know put it out as a but     
40:36     
Bradley I now that your point is me I'm writing the abstract so okay I you guys     
40:43     
want to share an abstract uh we have probably what what time is the I'm     
40:49     
submitting the abstract but I haven't the reason why uh I'm sticking over people apologize is because I     
40:58     
but basically the reason why you're writing the paper like that I think is because     
41:04     
I'm looking at the paper paper     
41:12     
not fuzzy is enormously fuzzy but that's okay because we can work with that so um     
41:19     
if you have ideas can we change your you there's couple of ways you can do this     
41:25     
I'm going to write an abstract based on a few things we just shared plus the     
41:30     
foundational models are in there we talked about I said a few things that I said now if you     
41:36     
written them up which I forgot what I said but then I'm GNA write a fuzzy abstract and then I'm gonna open a payer     
41:45     
and uh and we can hack this idea flash them out I think October is the done I     
41:51     
have another deadline but by now you know I should be able it would be great     
41:56     
so I'm going if that's okay if you think these ideas are discussed out on a few of them put the     
42:03     
ab in and then we can work on the paper excuse me do you know if the ab it     
42:10     
doesn't seem to have a l     
42:16     
ask right what was that the abstract can be just a few     
42:22     
paragraphs uh yeah usually like maybe a page you know a few paragraphs just kind of going through the     
42:28     
ideas uh I submitted something in about 600 words so it's not like huge it     
42:34     
doesn't need to be like a mini paper it just needs to say what what you want to do yeah I have because I haven't fig it     
42:40     
yet but you know I stay vague based on their vagueness and their goal and I     
42:47     
will open a draft for for shed so if if you become inspired by the end of the     
42:52     
summer you have another can um do you would you like to look at my abstract     
42:58     
before I submit it or S it yeah that would be good if you could actually put it in the cybernetics channel uh you     
43:05     
know I'll do that right yeah and today in in where you are means     
43:11     
in 12 hours and of today 12 hours yeah     
43:16     
yeah it's about yeah it's probably about 12 hours yeah if I     
43:23     
work yeah it was not my     
43:30     
intention know so in which case do me a favor I'm GNA have this in a couple of hours I'm     
43:37     
gonna work on this now and if you could give me the feedback before I go to bed uh I mean I     
43:46     
will bit and then I will so is that okay is that possible     
43:51     
anyone interested here give me the feedback I say here and we someone     
44:02     
else yeah you think yeah sounds good yeah okay I'll do that then in which     
44:08     
case I'll switch off and work work on this and look out for     
44:15     
my channel and then I will submit it shortly after     
44:22     
okay hopefully with your feedback and if not you can always ask add them to     
44:28     
update the abstract tomor okay yeah yeah I think they just want an abstract to get a sense of where     
44:35     
you're going with it I don't think it's like has to be like perfect but yeah     
44:40     
we'll give you some feedback on it yeah it'll be fine that would be great thank you so     
44:45     
much thank for I think it's something I should be doing yeah yeah I see you I swi     
44:54     
okay all right so I think think uh yeah um I know Hussein wanted to talk about     
45:01     
his paper on ethical stimulation but I don't know I know he was at a Starbucks     
45:07     
and he had a weave maybe so uh if he comes back we might talk about that a little bit but otherwise U you know uh I     
45:16     
think there's a good discussion about the the ever good regulator about like Ai and about some of these issues with     
45:23     
you know Foundation models and World models and things like that definitely though yeah the call is very vague and I     
45:30     
think it's because it's I don't think anyone has a good handle on these issues     
45:35     
they're just kind of being thrown out into the world being gobs and like people are trying to figure out how to     
45:41     
synthesize them so that's maybe part of the problem too um and so yeah     
45:46     
definitely I think anything would help on that     
45:53     
right okay yeah I then I want to switch gears a little bit um I want to talk     
45:58     
about uh some things that uh we have     
46:03     
that are I guess coming up or relevant to some of our discussions and cognition     
46:08     
Futures in cybernetics again but these are uh resources and events and then I     
46:15     
want to get into some experiments I've been doing with large language models uh I've been trying to run a     
46:22     
larger language monana Raspberry Pi and i' successfully done that I'm going to     
46:27     
show some of the results of that so the first thing I'm going to talk about is this event here this is cograph     
46:34     
2024 um so this is an event that's happening I think at kogai 2024 so kogai     
46:42     
2024 is coming up uh the summer or I guess the fall I'm not really sure when it is but um this is a special I think a     
46:51     
special session affiliated with uh kogai 2024 this is     
46:57     
cograph and so cograph is the intersection of cognitive science and uh     
47:04     
like computer graphics and computer vision so this is very much like what the special issue is     
47:10     
about uh they're going to be doing something so the reason they call it cograph is it's intersecting with     
47:16     
sigraph which is a conference on computer Graphics in computer vision so     
47:23     
this is an interesting I think this is the first year for this type of Workshop this is a new workshop but the     
47:30     
interface between cognitive science and computer Graphics so you have the brain in the     
47:35     
teapot teapot is a model that people have built in computer Graphics to show     
47:40     
kind of like how computer Graphics this is a classic Model that people have used in the field and then of course we're     
47:47     
interested in the brain and cognitive Science Building Bridges between these scientific communities and help us ask     
47:55     
and answer big questions about perception and depiction so representations like we see up here     
48:02     
receiving those representations questions about how we see communicate reason and express     
48:09     
ourselves it's basically like we're building Graphics uh you know in     
48:14     
computers in Soo how do we interact with those so it's a human sort of a human     
48:20     
computer interaction uh uh perspective but it's also sort of a a perceptual science     
48:27     
perspective because of course our computer Graphics whether they be on a 2d flat screen or in a virtual world     
48:36     
they are you know not the same as physical objects on your tabletop or in     
48:42     
your room that you're in and so you know what are the sort of the differences between computer generated objects and     
48:50     
real objects and you know maybe we can make things that are hyper realistic     
48:56     
that can't tell the difference maybe there always going to be some very fundamental differences between the two     
49:02     
and so it very much hits upon this area what they call presence or you know this     
49:08     
this idea of being there and some other themes as well so this is really interesting     
49:14     
stuff uh they want to grow a community here so this is kind of their first     
49:20     
forway into doing this uh what they're going to do I guess uh they're going to have four virtual online seminars     
49:27     
they're going to feature interactive conversations with experts in cognitive science computer graphics and the Arts     
49:34     
then in Late July we will convene in person for activities at coxside 2024 so     
49:39     
I think this is going to be held in reram but also virtually I'm not really sure that this is going to be a virtual     
49:46     
thing but the definitely the online seminars will be virtual um so they're they're trying to     
49:52     
build a community here they're going to be going to both Cog site 2024 and it's     
49:58     
sigraph you can I think that's in 2025 so uh yeah so they they're just     
50:05     
looking for people to sign up here I don't know if people are definitely if you're interested you know just kind of     
50:11     
fill this form out um but this is these are the seminars so the first is visual     
50:18     
communication uh this is uh couple here people here from cognitive two people     
50:24     
from cognitive science two people from computer graphic uh at its best visual Computing systems     
50:30     
can Empower people to communicate with each other with their computer systems but sometimes visual Computing     
50:38     
Technologies can lead to miscommunication confusion frustration or worse so it's that human computer     
50:44     
interaction aspect usability aspect what causes communication to break down and     
50:50     
what can we do about so that's interesting uh the second one is visual perception again we have have three     
50:57     
computer graphics people two cognitive science people uh the idea of modeling human     
51:03     
perception is inverse Graphics so this is where the a specific type of Graphics     
51:08     
problem they're just modeling it as an inverse Graphics problem as long inspired researchers in cognitive     
51:15     
science and AI but despite Decades of progress such a model remains elusive     
51:21     
why what is the single greatest computational challenge in running Optical or physical simulations in     
51:27     
Reverse so I'm not familiar with the inverse Graphics approach explicitly uh but they're asking some     
51:35     
questions about computational uh problems and how to pose them and how to run these kind of     
51:42     
simulations in Reverse as opposed to forward and we talked uh you know at our     
51:49     
open source meeting yesterday we talked about multiphysics which are these kind of modeling uh Frameworks where you take a     
51:57     
system at multiple scales or multiple aspects of a system and you have they     
52:02     
have different physics so you might you know the unit of analysis might change     
52:09     
over uh your different aspects of your system like if you're trying to model a biological system you might model     
52:16     
proteins you might model uh molecular other molecular processes you might     
52:21     
model the phenotype and all those things are happening at different scales you have to integrate them into a single     
52:29     
model in this case you're trying to do things you know trying to figure out the     
52:35     
properties of graphics and some of these things and you're trying to model these things in an inverse way meaning you're     
52:42     
trying to reverse engineer the thing that you're looking at or the thing that's in that environment so it's     
52:48     
really interesting uh I'm not again I don't know exactly how they approach it here     
52:54     
but that'll be interesting to see seminar 3 is visual reasoning this has     
53:00     
uh two three cognitive scientists and two computer graphics people from designing tools to proving     
53:06     
theorems oh is that yeah people rely on spatial and     
53:14     
geometric abstractions to solve problems but of course some abstractions are more helpful than others so this is about     
53:21     
these different abstractions that we use in sort of uh mathematical or you know     
53:27     
computer representations we have to sort of you know not model every aspect of it we     
53:34     
have to take away certain as we have to rely on certain aspects that are maybe the most Salient and use that for our     
53:41     
model so this again is you know some abstractions are more helpful than others why how can you tell if an     
53:48     
abstraction will be useful in problem solving uh visual expression seminar 4     
53:54     
this has uh three graph graphics people one cognitive scientists the field of     
53:59     
computer Graphics has long been interested in algorithms for non-photorealistic rendering in     
54:05     
animation what is it about the human mind that drives us to create and allows us to perceive images and videos that     
54:12     
are not perceptually faithful in reality so this is an interesting one from the perspective of like you know modeling     
54:18     
things that aren't you know decidedly not photorealistic and so this has a lot     
54:23     
of ties to uh you know virtual environments as well so I mean this would be something to keep an eye on for     
54:31     
Designing in VR not just in designing for you know two-dimensional surfaces or     
54:37     
uh you know two-dimensional Graphics so that's uh Judy fan is one of the     
54:43     
organizers you know Jesse knows who that is and some other organizers here as     
54:48     
well so that's cogra um okay so then the second thing I want     
54:56     
to talk about is this morphological computation. org so this is morphological     
55:02     
computation uh this is their site and the reason I bring this up is because we've talked about this topic quite a     
55:09     
bit in cognition of Futures keep coming back to this idea because it's very much     
55:15     
linked to embodiment and I think I brought up the idea of morphological     
55:20     
computation as this Paradigm where you can look at like a morphology if you     
55:26     
have an embodied robot say you have a brain and it or I guess model that     
55:32     
serves as a brain and it does things and you know it interacts with the world to some extent but then the question is you     
55:39     
know that if you're an embodied agent how much of the how much of a role is the morphology of your body playing in     
55:46     
that interaction and it turns out in this field they've tried to quantify this and you know different ways and     
55:54     
they actually have you know found that there is this role of the body that is important in uh sensing controlling and     
56:03     
learning and improving those aspects so you know in robots body morphologies the     
56:09     
materials and dynamic properties of those body morphologies are extremely important and so you know in humans or     
56:15     
other animals it's taken for granted that their bodies are the way they are and we just kind of study that we don't     
56:22     
study so much the material properties of the of the body the dynamic properties     
56:28     
of the body although you know some people of course in some cases uh people     
56:34     
do um but it's it's you know in morphological computation they really     
56:39     
can work this out uh in terms of measures and in real world conditions so     
56:45     
this is really interesting uh you can do all sorts of things in morphological     
56:51     
computation you can create Innovative sensory skins for Prosthetics ET accelerate learning through physically     
56:57     
growing robots uh embed sensors and things like spider webs uh build intelligence     
57:04     
structures scaffold them biological cells and exploit things like Octopus arms for different Computing paradigms     
57:12     
so there are a lot of things you can do with morphological computation and not just study kind of     
57:17     
the r of the body now they have an ebook that's available and so that's the other thing     
57:23     
I was going to point to here this is helmet haer Rudolph hin and Ral Feer and     
57:30     
they uh this is called the opinions and outlook on morphological computation so     
57:36     
this book is available U I guess just kind of go through the chapters here     
57:42     
they have some really interesting chapters uh you know there these the     
57:47     
case studies that they go through to show like the sort of the power of morphological computation they have this Reservoir     
57:54     
Computing View which is uh interesting we've talked about Reservoir computers and sort of how they work and it's sort     
58:01     
of an upand cominging area um so that's an interesting uh chapter there's also this     
58:08     
aspect of morphology and kind of emotions and functional structure     
58:14     
um there's uh a virtual material approach to morphological computations     
58:20     
so focusing on how materials play a role in cognition uh there's a aspect of     
58:26     
heterarchy and you know we think of like uh model or models of intelligence is     
58:31     
sort of hierarchical we have things like subsumption architectures which are you     
58:37     
know structurally hierarchical one thing built on top of another but we also have these uh     
58:43     
heterarchical structures which are where different parts of the system play     
58:48     
different roles and it isn't that one part is dependent on another in its     
58:54     
entirety it's that they all sort of contribute to this larger structure so it's it's a     
59:00     
different way of viewing intelligent systems they talk about this in terms of like the body being one aspect the mind     
59:07     
being another aspect the brain you know the environment and all that so it's it's a nice uh way to sort of     
59:15     
synthesize some of these ideas uh there's this chapter of morphological computation and heris     
59:24     
biorobotics uh morphology is a concrete form of intelligence so we talked about     
59:30     
definitions of intelligence earlier and how we have these concrete forms of intelligence we can kind of sort of     
59:38     
characterize intelligence in this way and you know uh molecules and robots     
59:43     
which are where you know we're looking at molecules as computational machines     
59:48     
and so we think about like robots that are sort of animal likee we can also have morphological computation that's     
59:55     
like protein like or some molecular macromolecule like and you know that has     
1:00:02     
sort of the same sort of principles you have uh you know     
1:00:08     
different types of interactions between uh you know sensory organs the     
1:00:15     
Dynamics uh you know modeling your model of morphological computation on things     
1:00:21     
like bacterial movement uh looking at the evolution of morphological computation or wi that uh     
1:00:28     
morphology changes and some other things here having to do with design and other other     
1:00:36     
perspectives so that's that's that book and you know if that's something that's interesting to you please check that     
1:00:43     
out so Jesse put some things in the chat here uh I guess this one is he says     
1:00:52     
exactly yeah it relates to work in developmental AI devel in topics that     
1:00:57     
was in reference to the cograph or was that in reference to     
1:01:04     
okay uh yeah name is going to ask Judy fan about it yeah please do I'd like to know more     
1:01:10     
actually um then morph comp morphological computation so this is     
1:01:16     
like a working group that published this ebook I think yeah I think there were people who I don't think it's related to     
1:01:23     
the embodied intelligence Workshop but it is yeah yeah yeah definitely that the     
1:01:28     
set of ideas that you you saw to the heart of my question there I was like it it it I     
1:01:37     
didn't I don't have maybe you could put the website in there or I didn't see it but from what I could see from your     
1:01:43     
screen share it just like um I guess a group people that are     
1:01:49     
thinking about this stuff and they either called the actual like get in touch like like I don't know if that me like work with them or you a grad     
1:01:56     
student with them or join our reading group or what like I don't have any sense of that I'm not saying any that's     
1:02:01     
wrong I just I don't know you know any I have no idea yeah I could check into it     
1:02:08     
that's cool I I I would get it I will get in touch I'll ask you about it and I think like again like that that ties     
1:02:16     
into um uh you know a lot of other topical     
1:02:23     
interests that are like adjacent to it or like that kind of fit with like adjacent to the Devi like adjacent Dev     
1:02:28     
AI some some organoid stuff like within this space of you know um topics that     
1:02:35     
are that are on hand um as as a shout out to remembering     
1:02:43     
things that um Jen isn't isn't     
1:02:50     
here I remember anything she said about trying to organize some of the stuff to convey it to people who don't you know     
1:02:56     
how do we how do we try to communicate that to other to people who like say yeah we we you know here a set of topics     
1:03:02     
that we're thinking about in publish like there's there's stuff to do in that space for art like the on the ongoing     
1:03:08     
work that that she's helping with for onboarding stuff and just like knowledging that there are conversations     
1:03:14     
going on and to we have there m you know materials to to be made     
1:03:20     
there so acknowledgement of that and and appreciate the work there um     
1:03:27     
but uh my second point now if we have a few minutes I don't know how much time you have I guess we have like 50 minutes     
1:03:34     
left but like I'm made of other things so I don't know how much free time you have because I have a point I would like to a serious Point yeah we have a bit of     
1:03:41     
time yeah um and it     
1:03:47     
ties I will attempt to wear my reasonable hat and I'm going to give myself a little time to be unreasonable     
1:03:52     
and just um kind of cranky I think and maybe that's because I'm like fre     
1:03:58     
deprived and ban with the priv so just just to kind of frame it as I know I'm being a reasonable one sense but also     
1:04:04     
there's some fruit to what I want to say too     
1:04:11     
um and it it was triggered by going through the book structure and maybe I miss some of the structure I Don't Know     
1:04:17     
Much book and I'm I'm being a very superficial judgment um and also I don't know maybe     
1:04:23     
this is maybe this this maybe this book is or the authors are doing one are are     
1:04:29     
much I don't want to have them catching Strays if you will uh so so I give them     
1:04:36     
a pass and say I profound my ignorance about who they are and what they're doing in the book and it was mostly I     
1:04:42     
was I was triggered by the the format of some of these books and realizing I     
1:04:49     
don't know why but I had this visal reaction to the the the form of the     
1:04:56     
books and also format of some conferences that I've been to a lot lately around like not just the similar     
1:05:01     
topics but more at a meta or like Ed education     
1:05:07     
pedagogical um why don't we have nice things but like why don't we have nice     
1:05:12     
theories perspective and like I     
1:05:18     
know and and and the issue is in in so many terms     
1:05:24     
a lot of times you you have a book like this or a conference and you bring people together and you     
1:05:31     
say um hey we're a bunch of rers in this field maybe a new field maybe a niche     
1:05:36     
field we don't prepared dimatic we don't you know I'm I'm not saying that's often     
1:05:42     
a thing that's like stated or not but usually it's the case especially in many     
1:05:48     
areas of interest that are Innovative and places that I'm interested in talking about and I'm not out on that     
1:05:56     
um but I'm there was something in in the the     
1:06:02     
book and you know it's very common thing to do to have these books this like compendium hey we're all going to write     
1:06:09     
a book chapter on our ideas and we're not we're going to have perhaps widely different theoretical Frameworks that we     
1:06:15     
want to use but and that's fine and I'm not saying that's wrong I think that's important like we have to do that     
1:06:24     
however I feel like I want to basically do something I     
1:06:30     
want to make a like a functional administrative framework or like like     
1:06:38     
something because in in in the most the most     
1:06:43     
easily accessible visceral embodied version of it like we're talking about a book but there's a very similar thing     
1:06:49     
that happens in certain Converses too which is you get these p you you'll kind of     
1:06:56     
make like I went under that recently amazing I love the conference I love the event I love the panels I love the     
1:07:03     
structure however I kept waiting the whole time for there to     
1:07:11     
be a more synthetic broad ranging discussion that lets everybody be at the     
1:07:18     
table or at least a lot of people be at the table with the intention of extracting broader principles or like B     
1:07:25     
themes or like refining you kind of start the day with a set of questions or     
1:07:30     
ideas or implicitly even but then like after everything that's transpired     
1:07:35     
there's no like synthesis and may maybe some of the organizers do it maybe some like I I'll go back and blog post and do     
1:07:42     
it by myself but there's like this functionally weird it it goes back and this is this is something that maybe     
1:07:48     
only Bradley will get right now or maybe Morgan if you remember a very Niche thing that we said the lab but it goes     
1:07:53     
back to the idea of the tly reverse the trly birds and just just falling into the air his ideas discussion and then     
1:07:59     
they fall out and I feel like sometimes these events and sometimes the books     
1:08:05     
even like the book but but like the events like you shake the trees and there's a big blessed win and all all     
1:08:10     
these ideas happen and things come up and great discussions but like so many of the discussions I've wanted to have     
1:08:16     
in one of the recent events um like I couldn't have them because the conference wasn't structured to give     
1:08:22     
time to that kind of discussion and it's it's it's really like I really think     
1:08:28     
it's part of an an administrative or management thing um and it's it's also hard to do because it's it it require     
1:08:36     
like you can't really plan for it and and and it's almost a specifically it's     
1:08:42     
a specifically a thing for like like Niche smaller conferences that are on topics you don't get a lot of time for     
1:08:49     
that aren't well funded that aren't and for the for organizers you don't have you can't like you you'd have to to like     
1:08:55     
hire extra team just to make this happen the right way like I know there's reasons why this work like like I'm     
1:09:02     
asking for some something impossible here but I also feel like like like we're kind of like you're     
1:09:09     
doing all this priming work and you're creating this this context and you're having the people in the room and you're     
1:09:15     
getting the discussions like at the first level of of the discussion the     
1:09:20     
second level if you have a group panel the time for question and answer which never time for for all the N Things you     
1:09:27     
want to say anyway but like maybe like if you're lucky you'll get this     
1:09:33     
discussion at the end at somewhat synthesiz saying oh yeah we had these great conversations today let's review a few     
1:09:39     
ideas but there's not really like this actual synthesizing communication that     
1:09:45     
RWS with like there's no distilling there's no actually aggravating it and     
1:09:50     
like that's what that's for some reason like     
1:09:56     
and again this is no no I I hold my hands in I hold the white flag in the     
1:10:01     
air saying this is nothing to do with I'm not trying to to unload on the     
1:10:06     
morical computation ebook like it's sure it's wonderful nothing to do with that     
1:10:12     
but I like if I was if I was you know of course you know everybody wants the real     
1:10:18     
the World the song but also like in my like admitting like oh if it was just up to Jesse you'd have a part in these kind     
1:10:24     
of books that are dedic dedicated to this you'd have a part of convers better dedicated to this because it it's it's     
1:10:31     
kind of like put into this oh wouldn't it wouldn't be nice to do this but also     
1:10:36     
like I also feel like well you're kind of doing all this stuff and doing this     
1:10:41     
work and then the most important thing you're kind of like well uh we can     
1:10:46     
follow let's follow up on this on our own later I was like all right like okay but but there's not not     
1:10:54     
really centering of of things that are going to like certain elements of like     
1:11:00     
structure discussion that will actually push forward or     
1:11:05     
also create ongoing spaces after the moment you can't process everything at     
1:11:12     
the end of the day anyway yeah so that's kind of why the book I think got it for me I was like oh like this would be a     
1:11:17     
great I don't even know if they do maybe they do it in this book but many books where it's just the everybody write your     
1:11:23     
chapter about your idea as opposed     
1:11:28     
to even even like of of a real general     
1:11:34     
synesis of some major things in this process some major things we got were blank some major questions that came up     
1:11:40     
were blank and some you know like partial incomplete answers are this like     
1:11:46     
I feel like that's like that's the thing that we want to have     
1:11:53     
but also is so you know well like oh well that's not how it works and we don't talk about it     
1:11:59     
that way we don't have time to do that so we have to publish this I was just like okay so thank you for letting this is for a     
1:12:06     
bit of a therap I think this is basically academic therapy or like this so thank you thank you for everybody for     
1:12:11     
letting me just trauma dump about this I apologize for the tone and The Dumping     
1:12:18     
of things but no problem yeah I mean you know this is a always a challenge right like and sometimes fun agencies will     
1:12:26     
give money to groups who want to have a conference or a workshop that's     
1:12:31     
explicitly designed to sort of get some ideas in place so like with cograph you     
1:12:36     
know what they're trying to do is they're saying okay we need to frame these ideas we need to get some people     
1:12:42     
from different disciplines in the room and have these discussions and you know sometimes you write write a special chap     
1:12:49     
a special issue of a journal uh or a book where you know you solicit ideas     
1:12:55     
you say well we have this theme can we get enough you know can we get people to contribute different things and it's     
1:13:02     
going to depend on the people who are writing the chapters to kind of do their own thing because they have their own     
1:13:08     
perspectives on things and you can't like coordinate amongst like 20 people it doesn't really work well what you can     
1:13:15     
do is write your own perspective put it out there and then see where everyone's     
1:13:21     
perspectives are and what they try to do with some books and some special Journal issues is they try to write like a     
1:13:27     
summary where it says Okay um you know here here are the themes that have     
1:13:32     
emerged from these chapters and you know that's often done in special issues of     
1:13:37     
course that's not really space for synthesizing the ideas it's just a recap     
1:13:43     
so you know that's your point is well taken that you have to have these spaces     
1:13:49     
and a lot of times it's what happens with a lot of these special issues that people don't follow up on them or like you know in the case of a     
1:13:56     
workshop we fund a workshop for year one in a project and we want to get these     
1:14:02     
ideas out there but then year two we don't have a workshop that synthesizes things uh or we don't have that     
1:14:09     
Community to synthesize things or whatever so it's a missing piece and and needs to be I don't know how you would     
1:14:16     
do that it's not a priority usually because no the synthesis usually happens     
1:14:22     
like behind the scenes maybe um and if it happens at all and and like I I'm you     
1:14:29     
know I go on this um I don't know I'll say religion I go     
1:14:37     
into this not being naive about realizing you know etc etc etc but but     
1:14:43     
um like there's also like I I'm just very um I'll put it to put in a     
1:14:51     
different hat and a different lens for a second I do know there are     
1:14:58     
people and groups really trying to do this and to to to take some like kind of     
1:15:05     
get like I I'm kind of uncomfortable with the use of the term sometimes and even     
1:15:11     
using care but even who are willing to kind of go to quote unquote first principles of like how are we discussing     
1:15:18     
things at all uh but also like I I think I'm like     
1:15:25     
I I know there are people doing things like this but also like I think it's     
1:15:32     
worth considering that like the very structure and you know yes meting is     
1:15:38     
message to an extent but like the very structure of how we go about the things     
1:15:43     
is such a I don't want to say multiply but like it just such a strong influence on the stuff and like yeah like why why     
1:15:51     
is it the way that it is now well it's because the incentive for people is to publish an idea to talk about it and and     
1:15:58     
like okay it's out there I have the publication of the thing of the thing and if you want to do the theory work you know and build up stuff that's on     
1:16:04     
your own um and and and and I hear many like even going back to like many of     
1:16:10     
Amanda's um you know a man is disc content with some     
1:16:16     
some philos Phil philosophy stuff like where it's just like okay here's my idea and I'm not interested in anything other     
1:16:22     
than mind this idea and proving it is making as thorough as possible which has its place but also like I think I think     
1:16:29     
one of the CH like I want to I want to say in in my very emboldened uh uh self like I say     
1:16:37     
like well this is all great but like the the methods we're using here are not     
1:16:42     
going to generate the work that we need to do so it's like it it's you know and     
1:16:48     
it's it's just not you're not creating the space where you're for like forced to deal with it like like like that like     
1:16:54     
that's not fun that's not the fun part like I mean and to me it kind of is but     
1:17:00     
I'm you know I'm weird and the normal that way but like like we're we're training people to not really to there's     
1:17:08     
no no real concept like that's not it's like oh okay nice this issue but like it's like okay well where where are you     
1:17:14     
pushing this everything forward and I'm like all right so I guess I guess to to to come back to down Earth bit more what     
1:17:22     
do what what do I want to do with this I think I'm just     
1:17:28     
realizing there's some I don't know maybe there education Banner type work in the lab or     
1:17:35     
like this is this this is this for anyone who doesn't know this is the stuff I think about all the time in     
1:17:42     
whenever I say the word joepro joeo is about this like like at its core it's     
1:17:48     
what are the actual like what what do we     
1:17:53     
What what is the means by which we are going to get to be able to do or have     
1:17:59     
the discussions that need to happen to do a lot of important things push forward like that's why that's what it's     
1:18:06     
about um there there's all mentoring there's research and you or sure but like this is this is this is like the     
1:18:11     
things that I care about and you know I guess whatever the     
1:18:17     
whatever banners though we want to talk about and saying like I think I would love to uh     
1:18:26     
like I don't I don't know where it falls it's not like lab management maybe it's conference management May it's like meta like it's I don't I don't I don't mean     
1:18:34     
to say like oh well I just think here's how I think everything should be run and everybody just listens to this whatever but like I think there's a constructive     
1:18:40     
way to encourage people to incorporate more things too understanding that you're going like you have like the     
1:18:46     
advice has to be aware and not like ignorant     
1:18:52     
or whatever that like the influence is this way so like not like you can have you can have a blue sky session about     
1:18:58     
what you wanted to hear absolutely but also like the effective thing is understanding like you have tremendous     
1:19:04     
pressure away from doing those things and those are valid reasons why or at least they're realistic reasons why but     
1:19:10     
relative to that what do you do like when you're organizing when you're framing time for discussion when you're     
1:19:16     
running the conference when you're doing books like there are choices that can be made about slight incremental changes     
1:19:22     
there that I think about and that I I would like to talk more     
1:19:28     
about so like there's there's like a whole um like meta uh     
1:19:34     
administrative management whatever like whatever that is I don't I don't know     
1:19:39     
but that's like a a discussion group working group thing that is sort of like     
1:19:46     
the core of other stuff so more I would like to talk a little bit in the future and constructive way as just ran about     
1:19:52     
it here but I also and you're acknowledging we have been talking about     
1:19:58     
versions of this in in indirectly at least in in what in in we we don't     
1:20:05     
really have like an education Banner here but like I always I feel like that's one of the major like one of my     
1:20:11     
favorite things about the lab is that this is like kind of on the table we talk about it and so I'm I'll leave it     
1:20:17     
at that but okay no that's very good stuff and I encourage us to think more about that     
1:20:24     
and um yeah so Morgan but can other stuff so     
1:20:32     
I I took a lot of time so thank you for that you're welcome uh Morgan did you have something to say and know you've     
1:20:37     
been waiting here oh no no I I mean nothing nothing pressing I     
1:20:44     
I the most recent meetings that I've been to been the the foresight run ones     
1:20:51     
which you know is um I kind of like because     
1:20:57     
it's it's basically uh the whole the whole Workshop or you know conference if     
1:21:04     
you will is is filling out a group word dock yeah     
1:21:10     
yeah like like there's a certain you know it's nice it's it's nice that     
1:21:17     
there's you know there's nice that there's an output there's it's nice that the output isn't done you know like like     
1:21:24     
the out but is still there when you leave if you think of something else I I actually really want to do more     
1:21:31     
in the for suit specifically kind of because I think they're one that like it's kind of I'm not trying to be like     
1:21:38     
too like ironic but like I do believe like like they are trying to actually     
1:21:45     
have foresight in in like what they do and how they go about stuff so like I I     
1:21:51     
haven't done a lot of events but I know you've been there Logan's been there people been theirselves like I feel like     
1:21:56     
okay that's a community that's trying to embrace some of these principles but also like shout out to plot Twisters     
1:22:03     
who they're not we're not running conferences but like they're we're really do we've done a lot of this stuff     
1:22:09     
and how we try to do things I really really it's it's I don't have anything tangible that I could easily share about     
1:22:15     
that but even when we were talk like we basically alluded to this heavily at our inclusive gaming     
1:22:21     
conference because half the discussion was on like um you know codesigned for gaming     
1:22:28     
but also like how the organization is structured to intentionally address     
1:22:34     
challenges that are happening in the world and like how things are made and how things are done so like big shout     
1:22:40     
out to PL for that and like that's that's one of like excuse me that that's you know     
1:22:47     
there are groups that are doing things I'm that are that are are like Innovative and kind of centering these     
1:22:53     
ideas more I I you know anytime that comes up or whatever like I don't really I don't even know where to say like know     
1:23:01     
mention it in slack I don't know just tell me about it and and and send to Jesse and and we'll we'll put it     
1:23:08     
somewhere and because I I do like if anything this is an illusion to     
1:23:14     
this is a not current currently accessible but like     
1:23:20     
this is a a major topic of interest that I'm flushing out things in so we can     
1:23:26     
move on yeah thank you it it says here in the chat uh the way you can think     
1:23:31     
about this is Jessie has hard time that uh every conference isn't designed to be     
1:23:36     
like one of the old Macy's conferences yeah definitely that sort of idea that you're bringing people     
1:23:42     
together but the way they did it there is sort of a model maybe for how we should do these types of     
1:23:50     
Integrative exercises and you know I don't know if like they just were really good at doing     
1:23:57     
this or if they had a specific reason for doing the Macy's conference is the way they     
1:24:02     
did I think I think some of that is all like I mentioning that because of     
1:24:07     
cybernetics and something too but also like I think I think there's a certain ripeness and I I like and just like     
1:24:13     
things there were conversations to be had that just weren't happening now I feel like if there was to be I forget     
1:24:20     
they were like in the 40s or something right 50s like we did a 100 year anniversary that and did it well that     
1:24:26     
like it would looked like here's where the conversations have kind of gone in the last hundred years you know in in     
1:24:34     
various fields and subfields and whatever like things that didn't exist at at all obviously but then     
1:24:41     
like I feel like it' be really cool to do it at a first principles kind of way     
1:24:46     
we're like okay let's let's withhold that we know there's been 100 Years of development but then also let's take     
1:24:54     
that too like I'm trying to I'm trying to come with language for talking about like how do you deal an abstract with     
1:25:00     
the ideas almost like what is the idea and where did it go versus what is it     
1:25:07     
relative to the groundedness of what's happened like the historical things that have happened while realizing that sort     
1:25:13     
of almost like you know uh it's a it's a phenotype of     
1:25:20     
possibilities for how those conversations could it went and not the whole thing but it's a certain base off     
1:25:27     
of environmental interactions where they go on right yeah so like I'm I'm trying to develop language around this because     
1:25:33     
I feel like we don't we have so much pressure away from like context of that nature and and we kind of     
1:25:41     
like like I feel like so much like so much conversation is like it's like     
1:25:48     
we're seeing people bounce into these walls and and bump into walls and like trying to go in directions like like     
1:25:53     
there's not really language that hey there is a wall here and it's here because of this stuff that's happened for a long time so like you know you     
1:26:01     
don't have to run into it or like if you're hurt here's why because you ran into this wall and like that's why     
1:26:07     
there's pain around this topic or like resistance and we're like we're just     
1:26:12     
kind of watching people that do it it's like no that's that's tough isn't it it's like well there's better be     
1:26:18     
something that that can be done here but anyway I want regress so yes is always     
1:26:25     
how people blame the system for things that don't happen or don't happen and it's like well yeah the system we don't     
1:26:32     
you know we say it's a system we don't you know know what the Contours of the system are necessarily we just operate     
1:26:38     
within the system and if things don't happen maybe blame ourselves or but you     
1:26:43     
know the idea of a system is sort of there's no agency there it's just kind of like I'm just GNA do something and if     
1:26:50     
it can't happen then too bad and you know if you want to change things in in     
1:26:56     
the world of acade Academia or especially when you're exploring a new field you know uh maybe you need to     
1:27:02     
understand why things are the way they are to make change and     
1:27:08     
yeah one very brief tangent this this is this is this is so amazing like this I'm     
1:27:16     
not I wish I I wish I could share the full context of how what Bradley just     
1:27:22     
said is the most full circle thing uh given what's happened this week and     
1:27:28     
other things that I'm doing uh and I'm going to I'm like unfortunately that     
1:27:34     
just I'm going to tr try to hold back and be concise but I will say um I've had conversations this week     
1:27:42     
specifically about that and even specifically about the sort of the DSM project which is kind of evolving into     
1:27:48     
like the mental health working group or something but in a very applied sense like when you are asking when you are     
1:27:55     
talking to a mental health professional when you're talking to a doctor like the     
1:28:01     
nature of what Bry just said and the conversations you're having about     
1:28:07     
treatment or care with awareness of that or lack thereof affects things quite a     
1:28:12     
bit like like do PE like is there and there's reasons for it not to like in     
1:28:18     
some cases if you have stability and you're approaching a doctor or professional whose main goal     
1:28:24     
is ensuring that stability of your condition or of your whatever that's not     
1:28:30     
necessarily wrong or bad but it's different from going to a doctor or     
1:28:35     
going to an environment or going to trying to get treatment or trying to understanding where there is systemic     
1:28:41     
awareness and change too or like like someone who understands or at least sees     
1:28:47     
their job or their approach as want like moving the ball moving changing the goal     
1:28:53     
post or taking in the arena somehow and it's just like totally different kinds of communications interactions and I'm     
1:28:59     
not saying one's better or worse it's just we don't have good language for differentiating those kinds of     
1:29:07     
conversations or discussions and it's it's left to be very abstract and you know a lot of lot of uh a lot of     
1:29:16     
potentially avoidable Strife no less more fruitful     
1:29:22     
outcomes to be made when there's progress in that space so yes uh I'm     
1:29:28     
being super vague but that was a wonderful turn of words so thank you and     
1:29:34     
away my thanks for that uh yeah so Morgan did you have     
1:29:41     
anything else to say before we move on     
1:29:48     
to well just uh there's some interesting     
1:29:53     
just in terms of updates in general yeah yeah yeah the     
1:30:01     
um sorry I'm just seeing um yes I was just checking um slack here     
1:30:11     
and um did everybody did you get access Jesse to     
1:30:17     
medark met AR Discord there there's a couple new um     
1:30:23     
organiz intelligence papers um the um this open and remotely accessible     
1:30:32     
neurop platform for research in wetwear Computing and a new one from the dish     
1:30:38     
brain I I haven't posted it in slack yet um but um looks looks also looks     
1:30:49     
interesting so another another company is um is doing you know a version of     
1:30:59     
dish brain um and I got to meet this week with um a student from University     
1:31:07     
of Michigan who uh well recent grad I should say who was     
1:31:14     
was has been talking to this particular Swiss company called final spark that's     
1:31:21     
the the company that's doing something like collapse um that     
1:31:29     
looks looks again looks looks interesting um um still seems quite     
1:31:40     
um you know it's quite modest in its in its goals right like like dis bra in the     
1:31:46     
sense that like these this is this is still um there's still a number of um     
1:31:54     
there's a number of problems to be solved in terms of really     
1:32:01     
exploiting 3D organoids in in a um let's call it in a     
1:32:09     
computer engineering kind of way um you know and um anyway it was it was great     
1:32:18     
to meet with with Michael this week uh it was great to meet with this student     
1:32:23     
students um you know he's familiar with a bunch of these a bunch of other groups     
1:32:30     
trying to to work on organized intelligence so we had a great conversation     
1:32:36     
about about different approaches and different different groups interested so     
1:32:41     
that that was really nice um the the Celsius bolab uh how to grow almost     
1:32:48     
anything was focused on biomanufacturing and lab Auto     
1:32:54     
this week so um got to think a little bit about that as well in terms of you     
1:33:00     
know um just identifying     
1:33:07     
some yeah things that will probably be useful for for cell culture and and     
1:33:14     
again like organoids organoid culture there's     
1:33:20     
there's a lot of um there current ly you know it's a very     
1:33:25     
manual process run primarily by posts and so culture     
1:33:32     
people uh um and that involves um some     
1:33:40     
uh some quality insurance as well and so just think thinking about the the lab     
1:33:48     
Automation and computer vision that could be um a part of     
1:33:55     
the yeah just just try to scale that um and I I think I mentioned this     
1:34:02     
last week but you know Allison mri's lab did publ no maybe I mentioned it at dorm     
1:34:11     
um but just that Alis mri's lab had released a protocol this month um that     
1:34:19     
they call their semi-guided um like I forget exactly endogenous     
1:34:27     
oscillations um let me see what we call it yeah generation of semi-guided     
1:34:32     
cortical organoids with complex neural oscillations um and it it got     
1:34:41     
highlighted by uh Axion biosystems as well so which just again reflects this     
1:34:50     
um you know there there are there are companies you know that aren't organoid     
1:34:56     
specific but you know biotech companies that are interested in being the equipment manufacturers for this yeah     
1:35:04     
and and this this follows you know bra Jers um uh cat Karina um vook um I     
1:35:14     
forget how to pronounce her last name but um uh doing doing some things with     
1:35:20     
Maxwell biosystems anyway in this in this particular case they're just is you know     
1:35:27     
one setting out the protocol for for others um who who you know if you want     
1:35:34     
to get the kind of oscillations that we were getting in our 2018 paper you know     
1:35:40     
this is this is the protocol and um you know it it does it was a nice     
1:35:49     
blueprint in terms of if you're interested in the electrophysics iology     
1:35:54     
you know specifically these complex neural     
1:36:00     
oscillations what's different between you know the the unguided growth and the     
1:36:05     
semi-guided cortical organiz that is     
1:36:10     
um you know it gives you kind of the the     
1:36:16     
yeah tisue differentiation differences that are that are apparently key to to     
1:36:23     
you know getting this this complex Behavior so um that's what I was kind of trying to     
1:36:31     
get at Diva worm in terms of just yeah like like what would we how     
1:36:39     
many things would we want to track and and um     
1:36:44     
uh yeah how many things do we think would be important to capture     
1:36:51     
molecularly that would reflect these these differences right     
1:36:56     
yeah um be you know because again like like in terms of setting some of     
1:37:06     
the like the science like our our own personal organoid research science     
1:37:13     
goals the the kind of the bioelectricity or the yeah the the the     
1:37:22     
electrophysiology uh um to some degree is is of the of real     
1:37:28     
interest um and and again it somewhat ties to the kind     
1:37:34     
of larger work in terms of interpretability of like adult     
1:37:41     
EEG as well as as yeah like how much how     
1:37:46     
much because electrical signals are     
1:37:52     
available farfield you know how how much physiological information can we get by detecting     
1:37:58     
electrical fields and then inferring you know um uh     
1:38:05     
about microphysiology right yeah yeah so that     
1:38:12     
yeah yeah that's cool yeah yeah that that that was that was that was great I     
1:38:18     
mean you know like like organoid intelligence     
1:38:24     
I I you know understanding bio electricity or     
1:38:31     
understanding the complex oscillations um is is part     
1:38:39     
of this organoid intelligence program in terms of how to do you know H how can     
1:38:46     
you use biology to create um     
1:38:53     
to create structures that you know one     
1:38:59     
are are amenable to computational Neuroscience modeling and two would be kind     
1:39:07     
of again kind of amenable to     
1:39:14     
being used Mo most readily used as as     
1:39:20     
um you know neuro co-processor or you know neurobo co-processors     
1:39:29     
right and and so um it's covered this but I I I've really     
1:39:36     
put this into a dock in terms of just you know ideas from you know going back     
1:39:44     
to the the um the the Book of Genesis but of course     
1:39:50     
by that I mean the the Book of Genesis computer simulation     
1:39:55     
program uh and and you know Jim Bowers U     
1:40:01     
which I had I looked up and I checked and it it it was uh copyright     
1:40:08     
1994 so uh uh I had I had just     
1:40:17     
graduated college yeah um and the     
1:40:24     
you know Jim Bow's focus with Genesis on     
1:40:29     
the S Bellum and and you know     
1:40:34     
like just being an example of perhaps a a 3D biological structure that that     
1:40:43     
leads or you know L lends itself to um a     
1:40:50     
um you know I mean one of the reasons he chose it was for ease of modeling right     
1:40:59     
and and to to some degree you could see it as being a bunch of the same unit just     
1:41:07     
repeated which again strikes me as as somewhat a     
1:41:15     
somewhat um semiconductor design principle     
1:41:20     
yeah yeah uh and then it it also fits in with a     
1:41:27     
number of you know modern views of s bellus as being um this general purpose     
1:41:35     
coprocessor that that actually serves serves other functions or you know     
1:41:41     
Ser serves as a processing system for for varied     
1:41:48     
varied functionality right which is you know again slightly you know     
1:41:56     
CPU um but but being very unsure of kind of what representations are being fed     
1:42:01     
into that and what operations are being done on it like still you know and and     
1:42:07     
and hopefully yeah that they they have a kind of     
1:42:12     
universality um and     
1:42:19     
uh yeah and then there's um I just thought it was also you know like you'll     
1:42:24     
see in brain organized it's a big emphasis on DNA um DNA modeling um which     
1:42:33     
includes something new from the brain engineers and it's important to remember that brain Engineers are in The     
1:42:39     
Institute of genomics there you know and so it's it should be no surprise that um     
1:42:48     
you know groups like that are are of course really interested in the same thing in terms of just what how how to     
1:42:57     
you know now now that we've now that we are growing these these [Music]     
1:43:03     
organized how how can we capture the the differences in expression and the     
1:43:08     
differences in yeah um cellular cellular physiology such that     
1:43:15     
we can understand you know mechanist mechanistically um what's happening in     
1:43:21     
in health and disease right yeah um but there's some some good links     
1:43:29     
there um yeah I thought I thought the the um     
1:43:37     
the talk on the human regul was was really interesting um     
1:43:44     
and T you know giving a nice historical overview of the encode project as well     
1:43:53     
yeah you know and um and it     
1:43:59     
um there's an a new tool from jentech uh and it looks like it's a     
1:44:05     
former in initro person which is the you know another big big a big tack     
1:44:14     
approach to biology yeah you [Music]     
1:44:19     
alumni um and their tool just also reminds me of the     
1:44:25     
the the regulome approach from from Basel     
1:44:31     
which is I think like Ro's um R&D Center um well actually     
1:44:39     
jentech ISRO yeah in these days of of multinational consolidation yeah they     
1:44:45     
all they're all one Bo Corporation um but uh really really nice over VI for     
1:44:54     
for everyone and it um that might also be interesting if if if you're following     
1:45:01     
the computational Psychiatry there been some papers from Psych     
1:45:07     
code they had like like nine papers in science and you know so so some some big stuff     
1:45:16     
in terms of that um yeah statistical genetics in the     
1:45:21     
brain oh do you know what this is it like a special issue of science then that they'     
1:45:29     
I don't know if it's a special issue um anyway I I will I will check that but     
1:45:35     
again like super super valuable to to just capture     
1:45:41     
that that history of encodes and you know again the importance of these     
1:45:47     
regulatory elements how much we've uh we've learned over the um past 20 years     
1:45:58     
yeah all right well thanks yeah that was good we'll have to look those things up and uh follow up on them I'm glad to see     
1:46:05     
that organoid intelligence is making some progress and we can you know follow     
1:46:11     
up on that I think there's a lot of stuff with respect to like you know     
1:46:16     
regulatory Frameworks or sort of models of Regulation that can be applied there     
1:46:21     
probably are useful there but we'll see yeah yeah and and just     
1:46:28     
also shout out or you know definitely again I might have kept this     
1:46:35     
in in Celsius just because it's got more organoid intelligence than than brain     
1:46:42     
organites in general but um uh just a great group in Newcastle that is doing     
1:46:48     
um DNA organoid Computing um that     
1:46:55     
um that you know again it's like a really cutting edge synthetic     
1:47:01     
bio Community there yeah I GNA drop a link in for that too but all     
1:47:08     
right all right so let's move on uh I wanted to talk about this experiment I     
1:47:14     
was doing with large language models I also forgot I have this wanted to talk about the 1 billion um row challenge     
1:47:23     
data science let me share my screen it's kind of interesting so yeah first thing I'll     
1:47:29     
talk about then is this one billion row challenge so     
1:47:34     
uh Paul and I had a conversation about like what I talked about last week with     
1:47:40     
or maybe two weeks ago with respect to Sim City and spreadsheets and things     
1:47:46     
like that and how when we build simulations we really have like these     
1:47:52     
representation ations of data and you know spreadsheets offer this interactive     
1:47:57     
way to deal with it and she wasn't actually familiar with how people do things uh by importing data from like     
1:48:05     
different formatted files and things so I explained to her how that works but this is an interesting point with     
1:48:12     
respect to data very big data sets and something that you'll see in data science as you do analysis of like very     
1:48:20     
large data sets that we have now so it turns out that like when we're dealing with you know small sets of     
1:48:28     
parameters if we summarize things in tables like we saw with Sim City or with     
1:48:33     
some of the urban simulations where we just set sort of the values for the parameters and you know that that's what     
1:48:40     
we're dealing with that's you know we can deal with that easily and feed that     
1:48:45     
into like a simulation and do the simulation over time but you know     
1:48:51     
sometimes we have very very large data sets and so this is where there's this     
1:48:57     
challenge that a number of organizations have been kind of dealing with because     
1:49:02     
it's a practical limitation of their ability to deal with data so uh this is     
1:49:08     
called the 1 billion row challenge so a row is sort of this horizontal column in     
1:49:13     
a data table and we usually want to have cases     
1:49:19     
that are you know uh inclusive of a lot lot of different observations and so in     
1:49:25     
this case let's say you have a text file with 1 billion rows and so the text file is just input format and it it     
1:49:32     
represents this table where each row represents a measurement from various weather stations so we have weather     
1:49:39     
stations around the world we have this coverage of a billion data points each data point is a is a row in this text     
1:49:46     
file and so how do we extract all these data get the summary statistics     
1:49:53     
the Min the minimum value the mean the maximum temperature in this case and     
1:49:59     
then display the results sorted alphabetically by a station so if we were using a spreadsheet that would be     
1:50:04     
really really trivial and even if we're using something like a pandas table in     
1:50:10     
Python that would be really trivial right but when you have a billion rows or a billion cases it's a little harder     
1:50:17     
to deal with because simply because we don't have the computational techniques worked out     
1:50:23     
that scale of data and of course we are getting that scale of data in a number of areas we have that in in Social data     
1:50:30     
we have that from the internet we have it in biological data as we get more of these omix data sets so this is a very     
1:50:38     
relevant problem and so there is this 1 billion row Challenge and so in uh let's     
1:50:45     
see the beginning of 2024 got the Java Community very excited so in this case they're talking about doing this one     
1:50:52     
billion row operation in Java writing the script for it and getting it to or     
1:50:58     
get it writing the program and getting it to a point where you can just execute it on the     
1:51:03     
command on the 1 of January Gunner morling Java Champion announced on his     
1:51:10     
blog uh the 1 billion row challenge so this is a rather new challenge the idea     
1:51:15     
was to write a Java program for retrieving temperature measurement values from a text file and calculating     
1:51:22     
the Min mean and Max temperature for weather station the file had 1 billion     
1:51:27     
rows and the program should print out the values peration alphabetically ordered so we're not trying to filter     
1:51:34     
the rows necessarily by relevance or filter out the noisy measurements or any     
1:51:40     
of that we're just simply trying to get the descriptive statistics for these 1     
1:51:46     
billion uh measurements and you know for a couple of variables where we're going     
1:51:52     
going to create a couple of variables from that from that 1 billion not so     
1:51:58     
that's basically what the challenge is and so the goal of this challenge is to create the fastest implementation so     
1:52:04     
it's not just how to do it how to do it quickly you know as opposed to like something where we have to spend a lot     
1:52:11     
of time getting data out of that format so this is uh so you know     
1:52:18     
hundreds of Java developers have gotten into this challenge using different Tri tricks and techniques to optimize their     
1:52:24     
code this is very classic sort of hackathon stuff where you know people are trying all these different     
1:52:31     
approaches and seeing what works and seeing what doesn't so some people were using low-level Java apis to communicate     
1:52:39     
with the source data file virtual threads the N Vector API or optimizing     
1:52:45     
garbage collector so these are all technical Tech you know different techniques that people are using so this     
1:52:51     
person Antonio Solas decided to enter the challenge using GitHub co-pilot chat     
1:52:58     
for intell J idea to learn about co-pilot so this is a Microsoft     
1:53:03     
development blog so of course they're going to do the co-pilot uh advertisement here uh this goes through     
1:53:10     
sort of using copilot to do this uh and of course what you have to do then is     
1:53:16     
prompt the model and it will extract the data so you're training the data on this     
1:53:22     
these billion rows you're prompting it for uh the minimum the mean maximum and     
1:53:30     
things like that and it's able to generate the appropriate data so you know this is of course one approach but     
1:53:38     
you know it it makes sense you think about it you train the model on the data you then extract the uh variables that     
1:53:47     
you want through some sort of prompt and if your prompt is good enough you can get the answer     
1:53:53     
and you know it's it precludes a lot of sort of uh you know ex Brute Force     
1:53:59     
extraction what's this say so this is where you know this is going over how you can optimize the     
1:54:07     
algorithm uh you know and then getting the result and then you know um yeah     
1:54:13     
it's it's an interesting challenge this is a graphic showing your prompt you review mod modify and iterate you     
1:54:21     
confirm the accuracy and wise and we talked about this last week with respect to large language models that you know     
1:54:27     
how do you achieve some sort of um you know training in terms of uh uh sort of     
1:54:35     
giving it some sort of set of prompts that are iterable and um you know have     
1:54:41     
some other properties that are not just you know Brute Force properties um so this is this is the one     
1:54:49     
example this is another example here the one billion row challenge shows that Java can process a 1 billion row file in     
1:54:57     
two seconds so this again is talking about this uh this is a graphic of the 1     
1:55:03     
billion challenge here let me zoom into     
1:55:09     
it so again where you have your rows your temperature values your Java     
1:55:15     
program whatever it is your uh you have to sort of Define how to calculate that     
1:55:23     
and then execute it over that uh in a in a short amount of time we don't want to spend a lot of time on it so the     
1:55:30     
challenges rules are simple only the SDK features running on any Java distribution may be used so you can't     
1:55:36     
use a lot of uh external libraries or data stores which you know limits what     
1:55:41     
you can do but also it increases the drive for creativity it allows you to     
1:55:47     
you have to be creative given the tools that you have in the SDK and so this is where you can use these kind of uh you     
1:55:54     
know you can not use just any you know the most expensive approach but use something that's uh really creative     
1:56:02     
really kind of constrains you and makes you be creative um you know did here is a     
1:56:07     
question from the interviewer did you encounter anything surprising in the solution space morling who we discussed     
1:56:14     
is the sort of the poser of this challenge says hacker is going to hack many solutions optimized for the     
1:56:21     
specific key set such as weather station names this worked just for this particular data set with the help of the     
1:56:27     
community we clarified the purpose so there were many interesting Solutions     
1:56:33     
the use of simd and the new Java native memory API and the highly optimized     
1:56:39     
parsing functions including s SW which is SD with a register SD being um single     
1:56:46     
instruction multiple data it's it's a framework it's kind of like uh you know multiple input mul multiple output so     
1:56:54     
this is sinb where you know it's just a data architecture where you have single     
1:56:59     
instruction and then you can get multiple data and it's a type of parallel processing so you know there     
1:57:06     
are a lot of things with parallelism that um are you know really intriguing     
1:57:11     
that people have been kind of uh developing in terms of software and this is one example of     
1:57:18     
that and then finally this is the 1 billion row challenge uh GitHub repository this is where you     
1:57:25     
can find things uh related to this challenge there's some a you know people     
1:57:31     
have submitted their average calculations here uh different entries     
1:57:37     
so you can review these entries looking at them uh different implementations for     
1:57:42     
the problem at hand and then we have a leader board somewhere which is I'm not seeing it here but I guess it's at this     
1:57:49     
site where he kind of talks about you know who's leading this uh challenge I     
1:57:57     
don't see it immediately but the point is is that if this is something you're interested in you can follow up on it I     
1:58:02     
don't know if anyone would have a better solution than what's been posed uh as of     
1:58:08     
today but this just something it's happening it's really interesting given     
1:58:13     
you know some of our discussions on processing data and data science okay so now I'm going to get to     
1:58:20     
what I promised about the uh large language model     
1:58:27     
experiments and so I I what I did was I wanted to implement a large language model on a Raspberry Pi and if you're     
1:58:34     
familiar with the Raspberry Pi it's a small device it's not very powerful but     
1:58:40     
it's something that you know has an U uh arm architecture so it's actually like     
1:58:46     
apple silicon in that way it's not as powerful as Apple silicon but the reason I'm bring up Apple silic is because I've     
1:58:53     
done some work implementing a large language model Apple silicon and I wanted to see how small you can get the     
1:59:00     
hard or how sort of uh low power you can get the hardware to execute these type     
1:59:06     
of models and they're a lot of models that can run on Apple silicon uh from     
1:59:11     
get from uh hugging face they have a number of models that they host that can run on Apple silin and you know it's     
1:59:18     
it's it's a challenge it'll take a while as you'll see uh but you can also do this on a Raspberry Pi and they have a     
1:59:26     
type of model called AMA that will run well on this so this is uh run on a pi     
1:59:34     
400 so this is the Raspberry Pi uh 64bit operating system um this is based on uh     
1:59:42     
Arch Linux so it's part of the Arch Linux distribution it just modified it for uh this Raspberry Pi Hardware it's     
1:59:50     
an arm architecture it's like 4 gigabyt of Ram uh so we're working with a very     
1:59:56     
low powerered machine for uh large language models um basically what you're     
2:00:03     
doing is you're installing a llama I have some pictures of the screen here     
2:00:09     
screenshotting was not great because you know it was using a lot of it all of its memory running this model and setting it     
2:00:15     
up so what you do is you do this through the command line you get a llama you install it and this is a llama is a     
2:00:23     
Linux based uh model for large language models so what it does is it installs a     
2:00:28     
llama and then you can choose from the models that you want to run there are some uh a number of models with     
2:00:35     
different uh numbers of parameters so I picked the one with the lowest number of     
2:00:40     
parameters which was F3 and so I ran F3 uh I got everything installed and     
2:00:48     
basically it gets to the point where you can issue a prompt to the model so you have to install llama it installs the     
2:00:55     
models and then it'll check to see if you have a GPU obviously we don't have a     
2:01:00     
GPU here we can only work on a CPU we run V3 which runs a bunch of things here     
2:01:06     
sets it up and then you get this and then you can get to the prompt so let's     
2:01:12     
go to that um this is running the model so here's where it sort of gets to     
2:01:18     
success these but these dots just kind of move around and then you have to enter your prompt here so that's the     
2:01:25     
idea um so it's working from a from a     
2:01:31     
you know it's working from an install and you're from a command line and     
2:01:36     
you're able to just prompt it there directly so the first thing I did was I wanted to put in some prompts to test it     
2:01:43     
so I did a very simple prompt first which was what is 25 by 25 actually it     
2:01:48     
didn't went before that but I'll get to that in a minute what is 25 by 25 this is something that a larger language     
2:01:54     
model can answer pretty easily because it's just an addition problem and it you     
2:01:59     
know puts it outputs the sum of 25 and 25 is 50 this is a basic arithmetic     
2:02:05     
calculation where you add the two numbers together so that's the answer and of course it generates this very     
2:02:11     
slowly so I'm I'm sitting there watching the thing move I'll show you some videos of how fast it is it's not very fast but     
2:02:18     
it gives you the answer you want for at least for that promt uh so that's uh basic addition the first     
2:02:26     
question I actually asked it was how many apples are in a or on in a card I misspelled it uh but the basically it     
2:02:34     
got this idea uh basically extracted the main idea here where it says as an AI I     
2:02:41     
am in unable to view images or physical objects however if you can describe the number of apples and their arrangement     
2:02:47     
in the cart I can help you calculate the total based on your description so it doesn't want to make a guess uh it     
2:02:55     
it just you know it just kind of gives you this instructions and on a prompt better and it says Please provide     
2:03:01     
specific details like Dimensions orientation or any distinct features so as to give an accurate verbal     
2:03:08     
description so that's interesting that it it tells you how to prompt it better     
2:03:13     
which is interesting but um that's that's how it worked and then uh you     
2:03:19     
know then I asked it a little bit more detailed question but something it should know what what is the history of     
2:03:26     
larger language models and so this is where it's generating a multi-part answer so this is where it gets a little     
2:03:33     
bit weird because it doesn't actually give me what I want here uh it says     
2:03:38     
large language models have an evolving history it says early attempts late 20th century concept using statistical     
2:03:45     
methods for natural language processing began to take shape in the late 50s with     
2:03:50     
re research Searchers like n Shamsky in his work on transformational grammar influencing computational models and     
2:03:57     
Linguistics good we have one answer then the second answer rise of machine learning 1980s me as one cooking utensil     
2:04:04     
is fry pod a fry pod is a kitchen tool designed for multiple pieces of food     
2:04:10     
simultaneously like chicken or and it gives me this answer that's not really related to Horizon machine learning so     
2:04:17     
I'm not really sure why it went down that path uh but then we go down a little bit more it finishes its thought     
2:04:24     
which is basically about fry pods for some reason but then it gives it another     
2:04:29     
two which is the internet era in the 1990s so it skips over this rise of     
2:04:35     
machine learning it gives me another two in the internet era which maybe should be three but I don't know what happened     
2:04:41     
why it glitched out here it could be the memory that limitations of memory it     
2:04:46     
could be a problem with the training of the model I don't know um and then this     
2:04:52     
is the the third this is where it's generating this third Point here uh this one here where it gets down     
2:05:00     
to talking about the GPT series it's completed a number of other points and     
2:05:06     
then it says the history shows a trend towards increasing scale so it gets like a lot of stuff right but it does get     
2:05:12     
that takes that detour it can compose this really long answer uh and yeah so     
2:05:20     
then we finally get to the sort of towards the end here where you know it's kind of going through here and then we     
2:05:27     
get to the end where it ends and it shows like another prompt so once I get     
2:05:34     
done I can prompt it again I can make a more specific prompt whatever I want to     
2:05:39     
do all right so that's good um so I'll just show some of these videos this one     
2:05:46     
is where I'm recording uh this is if you see down at     
2:05:52     
the bottom how it's kind of the cursor is kind of moving through the words in maybe about six or seven letter trunks     
2:06:00     
that's the speed of this uh you know the tokens coming through this model so it's     
2:06:05     
not incredibly fast you know if you were to run this on like a demo of open AI     
2:06:11     
you know chaty PT it would be faster than this it's going to be like slow     
2:06:17     
because it's on a on constrained Hardware um you know Apple silicon Works     
2:06:23     
a little bit better but it's not that great of a difference because it's just it's passing tokens out and really you     
2:06:30     
know you need like a lot of computational power to be really like sharp so I mean I don't know what the     
2:06:37     
constraints are here the model is very lightweight it doesn't have as many parameters as like a state-of-the-art     
2:06:44     
model so that's something to keep in mind and again you know it's it's passing out tokens at a sort of a     
2:06:51     
constrained right here so it's really slow in general and like I ran I     
2:06:57     
actually on Raspberry Pi 400 you can put in different operating systems so I was     
2:07:03     
using I did this with Raspberry Pi uh OS but then you can also I was using um mro     
2:07:11     
which is a Linux distribution and it was really really really slow using that so     
2:07:17     
it really depends on the efficiencies of the operating system on that so it's     
2:07:22     
really something that can constrain you not just the hardware but but the operating system as well so uh this is     
2:07:31     
the old Lama repo this shows you kind of the files that you need to run this you     
2:07:37     
can run it from the command line but you can also install it like this um you     
2:07:42     
know and so this is basically uh for Linux you can't install this on uh Mac     
2:07:49     
silicon you can install it on Windows I guess you can do Mac OS I couldn't do it I don't know what happened I guess you     
2:07:55     
can do it um install it directly but I was having trouble running a on macil or     
2:08:02     
Mac silicon so Apple silicon so um this is an article from Jeff ging and I was     
2:08:08     
wondering about this this is the final thing I'll talk about here but uh I mentioned that there's this sort of     
2:08:15     
lineage of arm processors and so arm 64-bit processors so you have the     
2:08:21     
Raspberry Pi which is arm 64 and you also have apple silicon which is arm 64     
2:08:27     
but much more powerful and so this is um Jeff geerling writes a number of things     
2:08:33     
on Raspberry Pi and he's very interested in that uh and so you know this is really something that you know first of     
2:08:41     
all for arm architectures they're very promising in terms of uh efficiently     
2:08:46     
dealing with uh memory and things like that but there isn't a lot of software     
2:08:52     
really designed to exploit that those architectures very well so you know this is some a direction in which I think     
2:08:59     
it's really interesting to build these very small Deployable large language models we can use Arm architectures to     
2:09:05     
do this very efficiently but we really need to write software for arm architecture very specifically to     
2:09:11     
exploit a lot of these features and like with apple silicon you know I know     
2:09:16     
people have been developing for Apple silicon for a while now but really I think there's probably lot more     
2:09:22     
potential for developing things for arm architectures and it's notable that the only two local machines have gotten uh     
2:09:30     
large language models to run efficiently or at least reasonably on have been arm     
2:09:35     
architectures so and so yeah it's it's an interesting set of     
2:09:40     
experiments um yeah so I I think Jesse had a couple of comments here I wanted     
2:09:48     
to get to um U there were there for other go back to that later     
2:09:54     
but cool to see this Morgan yeah oh just I was just     
2:10:01     
gonna say that um yeah the the you know     
2:10:07     
people that I that I know care about these kind of architecture things you know you might     
2:10:14     
say it really speaks to just the Intel chipsets um     
2:10:22     
um baggage yeah you know that that like like yeah I mean there's there's there's     
2:10:28     
some cool things about arm but it's really that it just it doesn't have to it doesn't have to you know maintain     
2:10:37     
such such compatibil you know Legacy compatibility     
2:10:45     
right um uh and you know and that they've got a they've been ble to use     
2:10:52     
that to get a bunch of things like real power efficiency is kind of what I would     
2:10:58     
say is their um Hallmark at this point is like you know again everybody as you see with     
2:11:05     
the um yeah yeah uh as you see with the um     
2:11:14     
the organoids intelligence you know it's it's all about doing the same     
2:11:19     
Computing uh but just with with you know a thousandth of the power yeah and and     
2:11:26     
yeah so you'll you'll you'll like this um or you know like that's just a great     
2:11:32     
example because it's the this um this organoid intelligence platform is using     
2:11:37     
llms or you know they want to use these to do things like llms and um there's     
2:11:45     
also I'll again I'll post this in brain organoids even though this kind of more     
2:11:50     
of a neuromorphic Computing but um you know the Open     
2:11:57     
neuromorphic Lab that UCSC um had a spiking neural network for     
2:12:03     
large language mod okay and apparently that same PhD student just did     
2:12:13     
a like a self-driving um um framework and the     
2:12:21     
there's there's some interesting stuff about just um again     
2:12:27     
their um you know H having kind of more of an electrical engineering or computer     
2:12:33     
engineering perspective on um um what yeah what are what are the     
2:12:43     
best um one of the best algorithms to tackle and and you know uh kind of makes     
2:12:52     
makes some statements again about neuromorphic Computing that uh again I     
2:12:57     
think are are really valuable um so that yeah a nice a nice demo     
2:13:05     
there yeah um as well as like I just you know I haven't done I I've I've had a     
2:13:12     
couple raspberry pies around and I I I I've been meaning to do you know like     
2:13:17     
like I should be doing more Fedora testing and we there's a fedora arm you     
2:13:23     
know uh image um I could be you know I     
2:13:29     
could be trying some of these things but but that's cool to do the large language model     
2:13:38     
too I I you know it'd be interesting to try you know the Microsoft C I think     
2:13:45     
okay they've got like a they got a micro model yeah     
2:13:51     
that's what I was using in Microsoft yeah P3 but that was the Microsoft model     
2:13:58     
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I I I you know I also gotta get better with all     
2:14:04     
these terms yeah I mean like like what do say I was I was helping somebody with a     
2:14:13     
an enigma like U you know this is psychiatric neuroimaging processing yeah     
2:14:19     
and um we were dealing with it's like apne tools which are from Ni right and     
2:14:27     
and you know we're going through as you would like the Man pages apne is a very     
2:14:32     
Unix you know it's old school Unix tools and um and then you know because he's a     
2:14:38     
younger guy he's just like well let me just ask chat GPT     
2:14:44     
this you know and a couple couple of the Celsius people too they're like never     
2:14:50     
used Chad TBT like uh but I really you know and it was     
2:14:57     
really you know it was nice I mean even though I know it's never looked at apne     
2:15:03     
tools before it doesn't know you know right you know it's a It's ability to do     
2:15:09     
that kind of just on the Fly um yeah retrieval and and yeah was     
2:15:17     
was very cool um but I I it like llama isn't llama a specific framework     
2:15:26     
yeah llama is a type of model and that's uh a lot more parameters than fee fee is a reduced model okay I can't remember     
2:15:33     
the number yeah and I think they have llama in a llama too but it's like larger and the idea is that you know I     
2:15:40     
didn't want to make use a huge model because you're trying to get it's going to be a lot slower uh to try to run so     
2:15:48     
you know with the the hardware constraints I wanted to run A reduced model you could on an Apple silicon I     
2:15:54     
can run the Llama models um but I I didn't show those that demo but it you     
2:16:00     
know it works on on more powerful software and then of course if you have all the computational power in the world     
2:16:07     
you can run these big models very efficiently was that like an eight gig     
2:16:12     
Raspberry Pi or a 4 gig actually 4 gig four gig so yeah yeah I I I mean I'm     
2:16:20     
curious of of at what point does memory become a bottleneck like I haven't seen     
2:16:25     
anybody do these kind of reduced footprint uh versions of this yeah well     
2:16:30     
I mean you know I think I was surprised that it worked on the Raspberry Pi I mean I know that people have been like saying you know people been trying to     
2:16:37     
get these really small models onto small Hardware so yeah that's that was one of the things I wanted to try out Jesse     
2:16:44     
asked what would you like to do with this going forward yeah I'd like to you know see how small you get the models     
2:16:51     
and the hardware that's always good but also you know you could use this if you wanted to deploy a Raspberry Pi and a     
2:16:57     
robot and you could use that as like the the brains of the thing you could use a large language model or figure out how     
2:17:04     
to build like a some sort of model with a lot of parameters and say how big can     
2:17:09     
we get these models on this hardware and how small can we get the hardware and see how you know what that kind of     
2:17:15     
relationship looks like how that scales yeah it's it's done it's it I mean this     
2:17:21     
the scaling is certainly one the the other thing I mean you know when we talk     
2:17:26     
about putting it on on a robot what we also mean is like how long can that robot run right exactly yeah like like     
2:17:34     
like if if you you know because because yeah if it's doing the agency then     
2:17:40     
you're kind of using it yeah yeah you and and and yeah so um the the power     
2:17:49     
efficiency overall and you know and that and that speaks to again this open     
2:17:57     
[Music] neuromorphic you know talking about     
2:18:02     
large damage model for spiking your La yeah um I know where almost at the end     
2:18:09     
of time I just there was did you see the um this um spiking spiking neural     
2:18:19     
cell paper no I'll post the link to they're using     
2:18:26     
recurrent neural networks in some way to do spiking neural     
2:18:33     
networks and and yeah um and I haven't figured out whether     
2:18:41     
this is useful for spiking neural networks or if it's just useful for     
2:18:48     
recasting everything as the tried and true you know kind of stuff that's     
2:18:55     
already running in tensor Club I can I can take a model based on this thing and then recreate the thing yeah yeah yeah     
2:19:03     
which I think like yeah haven't Haven people done with that with ours before I'll post it at I'll keep it in     
2:19:12     
organoids or do we have a Computing Channel yeah we have a couple channels     
2:19:17     
that could be appropriate we never did start a an Al M Channel you     
2:19:23     
know dat science that seems that seems a big     
2:19:29     
catch all yeah yeah it     
2:19:35     
is yeah yeah good deal good deal yeah yeah you might you might want to check     
2:19:42     
out the the brain organized for some of the llm stuff of jeans though Bradley oh     
2:19:48     
yeah yeah yeah and we've been talking about that in in uh D.A worm where we've been talking about like how they're     
2:19:55     
building large language models for like protein sequences and Gene sequences and     
2:20:00     
yeah but there's there's another one there's another one that um that I I'd     
2:20:06     
be you know again it's like I don't have a good venue for to talk about this just in terms of     
2:20:14     
um I thought an interesting opinion piece on um this is the cell knowing a gene     
2:20:21     
the distributional hypothesis of Gene function oh yeah yeah yeah I saw that paper actually yeah yeah     
2:20:31     
yeah again you know there's there's just um we're we're living in interesting you     
2:20:38     
know bio Theory times     
2:20:43     
yeah yeah I'm gonna have to talk about that in Diva one that paper okay cool     
2:20:48     
yeah yeah okay good deal good deal all right well thanks for attending today and uh have a good week take care     
2:20:56     
take care bye

## NOTES:
Invisible walls, barriers to progress.

* psychotherapy, treatment to get to stability. 

* no framework for change.


Morgan: MetArc Discord. A few new Organoid Intelligence items.

* wetware paper. Another version of Dishbrain (Final Spark).

* number of problems to be solved. Computer engineering of organoids. 

* OI topics and approaches. Celsius biolab (lab automation).


Organoid culture -- getting a system up and running.

* QA, maintenance techniques.

* semi-guided endogenous oscillations (Muotri).

* 1) set out a protocol, 2) electrophysiology (unguided, semi-guided), 3) get to complex behavior. 


How many things would we want to track, reflect differences?

* interpretability, physiological measures, reflect differences.

* understanding complex signals --> 1) amenable to modeling, 2) use as neuro-bio-co-processes.


GENESIS computer simulation program (1994).

* focus on cerebellum. Ease of modeling.

* same unit, repeated (design principle). General purpose co-processor.

* what representations are fed into, universality.


Braingeneers -- mutual interests --> capture differences in expression.

* Human Regulome -- history of the ENCODE project.

* big tech approach to biology (Roche, Genentech).

* Computational Psychology -- PsychEncode (9 papers in science).

* history of ENCODE capture, Organoids @ Newcastle.


Open Neuromorphic -- SNNs for LLMs.

* get in touch with Morphological Computation and Coggraph.

* "beef" -- format of books, conferences with educational pedagogical point.

* pre-paradigmatic fields -- what is the structure? Book chapters, talks are not well-integrated.

* functional administrative framework. Synthetic, wide-ranging structure.


Twirlybirds -- great discussions. Conferences gives more time to meta-stuff.

* what they speak to. Cognitive Science project and computation.

* likeness of a machine to cognition. Nuance in paradigms aren't quite there, applied aspect (DSM --> agent and environment).

* structures, what are the tables in the dining hall? 


First level, second level -- no distillation, aggregation.

* center structured discussion ongoing spaces after the moment.

* major themes, topics that are blank, need to be followed upon.


People, groups who know how to do this. Go to first principles.

* methods won't generate the work we need to do. Education banner, JoPro stuff.

* discussion that needs to happen to push things forward.

* advice must be aware, guided to usefulness.

* framing time for discussions. How to move to the next steps?


Morgan: Foresight-run meetings. Filling out a group Word doc. Output for attendees.

* design for a Macy conference -- innovative approach.

* what is idea, where did it go vs. what is idea, how does it work.


Program, no program -- doesn't matter how stochastic, still a program (bounded system).

* different paradigm. Expressed intelligence not correspondant with states.

* how do you define AI, intelligences and behavioral responses.

* Q: make edits. Do more with intelligences, terms in Psych being well-synthesized. Models that were made.

* brain expands and contracts, focus on things (post-processing).


Looking for feedback -- bullet point for each section.

* what is paper going for? Single sentence summary. General systems theory.

* what is intelligence, intelligent response? Separate things.

* response vs. input, processing through a framework.


What are the best algorithm to tackle? Fedora ARM image. Microsoft Phi3. LLAMA models.

* Spiking Neural Cell paper. SNN -- Spiking Neuronal Networks.

* Brain Organoids -- LLMs for gene expression.

* Distribution Gene Function paper.



Adjacent to Developmental AI.

We can talk a bit today about the Ethical Considerations of Closed-Loop neurositmulation

Jes (OREL) says:
(I will. mostly just be listening for a while) 
Jes (OREL) says:
If you can wait until next week , I will havea lot m ore time to go through it fully . 
Jes (OREL) says:
looking forward tot. his paper and also more with adam too

sorry I got kicked out, found the call 
9:40

Jes (OREL)
Jes (OREL) says:
exactly . And itrelates to wwork n devAI, and development, and many niche topics 
Jes (OREL) says:
üëç 
Jes (OREL) says:
i was going to ask about judy fan yes 
Jes (OREL) says:
re morphcomp... so this is like a working group that published this ebook? It doesn't seem to be an event, but I'mnot sure what it is, or the group is? 
Jes (OREL) says:
second... I have "some beef" with something that comes up in academicy-things , that might fit for this ebook and other events I 've attended. 
Jes (OREL) says:
which I may have a constructive rant about if I have a few moments to do so 
Jes (OREL) says:
that monologue perhaps should be entitled "Jesse Has. Hard Time THat Every Conference Isn't Designed TO be Like one of the old Macys Conferences" 
Jes (OREL) says:
'with the help of the community we clarified the purpose' 
Jes (OREL) says:
is it basically like a kapggle competition? 
Jes (OREL) says:
üëç 
Jes (OREL) says:
"having to maintain legacy compatibility" is another interesting concept at large 
Jes (OREL) says:
forgive me if i missed it, but, what do you want to do with these thigns going forward bradly? more pi & llm projects? 
Jes (OREL) says:
yup 
Jes (OREL) says:
aside comment: morgan - is neurohacker (or neurhacker boston) predominatl in slack channels or discord?

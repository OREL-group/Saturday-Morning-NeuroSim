Transcript     
0:01     
hello hi hello good morning morning if you want to start with     
0:09     
something um I can do some very very broad updates     
0:17     
why don't you go ahead with your short updates and we can go from there     
0:23     
so my very broad updates for this week are     
0:31     
as we somewhat discussed um as we     
0:36     
discussed in the open source meeing for a little bit     
0:42     
uh the sort of main event is the was the     
0:47     
neurom match mentoring sessions this week and as a whole um I actually really like that     
0:55     
that happened and I'm really glad to have been a part of it     
1:01     
if it's too noisy here let me know I'll try it's fine that's fine     
1:07     
um nothing nothing too major from them to say other than I'm really glad that     
1:13     
it was it was there and I think you I'm really glad that it happened and     
1:21     
I I am curious that someone from one of the many things would want to check out the lab I think you kind of said the     
1:27     
same thing someone might be interested in that too [Music] um but it's it's a really interesting     
1:35     
primer for me most of my thoughts are most of my updates are sort of in the     
1:40     
realm of like future uh like I'm getting very excited about the coming sort of     
1:47     
fall semester stuff and I want to do things there I want to I really want to um maybe this something we can     
1:54     
briefly talk about today is um     
2:00     
just think about like internships and things we might want to offer or like if there's specific things we want to put     
2:06     
out there so people coming into the fall semester can can do um or look at or get     
2:13     
excited about or start posting uh we're we're there and I'm not you know 100%     
2:21     
finished with all my J Pro administrative infrastructure work but it's     
2:27     
um it's it's basically ready like like     
2:32     
all the things I've been trying to do on that side of thing there um so you know     
2:40     
things will be kind of returning more to normal normal as     
2:45     
August you know completes you know turns     
2:51     
to September um in terms of like reading groups and events and projects     
2:58     
but um     
3:03     
the mentoring sessions definitely made it made it a visceral     
3:09     
thing of like okay there are people here there are people curious about this stuff you want to do these things um as     
3:16     
I said last time it was really pleasant surprise to hear someone just kind of outrightly say yeah I'm really     
3:21     
interested in studying embodied intelligence and so just kind of as a reminder like even though sometimes it     
3:27     
feels very very very niche um or like just not     
3:33     
mainstream if we have stuff ready to do the things that we want to do and then     
3:39     
people come across it they'll they'll have a lot to to to connect     
3:45     
to um I don't think I'm going to have time to do something like the following but I     
3:52     
would really like to [Music]     
3:58     
um like like do something very specific like like a continuation of     
4:04     
Developmental brro vehicle stuff um like there's something there that could happen and I     
4:10     
think I know I'm really Meandering here but but I think one of the things I really like to do are advertise for essentially an assistant lab manager or     
4:18     
even if they're experienced enough a lab manager like Virtual Lab manager     
4:25     
um uh like they could go into social media or other things like that someone who     
4:31     
is um interested in spending some time with     
4:38     
lab Administration stuff uh and and what I mean by that     
4:45     
specifically is um there's     
4:52     
certain certain very small things uh and giv given my my experience     
5:00     
in the lab right now I think I know better how to direct those efforts than     
5:05     
before um as a side note like I think I'm very happy to to to do things     
5:14     
with with notion but I think for project     
5:19     
management and development of ideas things keeping that away from     
5:25     
notion is is a change that I I might make more intentional and by that I specifically mean just     
5:32     
having a templated structure of essentially Google Docs     
5:39     
and um a formalization of some of the project     
5:45     
things that's very accessible is something that I think between that and     
5:51     
just implementing you know with and with someone else or with myself then with     
5:56     
you or who whoever wants to do it but going through these different products space in the lab and kind     
6:01     
of giving them a little touchup but then also you know making     
6:08     
them it's sort of the balance between you know if if one if one wanted to they     
6:16     
could simply just go through all these different product spaces and make them you     
6:23     
know a present like like vitim more     
6:28     
project Orient or make them more like a thing ready to do in that sense and I     
6:34     
realized that almost certainly won't happen at at like every instance of what     
6:40     
we could do in that space but um and I don't I don't think     
6:46     
they I don't I don't like I would be really surprised if find someone who wants to do that that's that's great I     
6:52     
think much more likely is for a few key specific places we find someone who's somewhat interested in doing that kind     
6:58     
of nitty-gritty work but we work with them to basically get some things into a     
7:04     
much more like ready ready to launch or like you know where to where to pick     
7:11     
things up because I think so much the work is just where to pick things up and then where to     
7:20     
um sort of parking the car on the downhill slope kind of idea like can we     
7:26     
take some cars that are like almost in the junkyard and clean them up and then put them on a downal slope so when     
7:32     
someone's ready to drive them and go somewhere they're ready um and I don't     
7:37     
like I don't think that's going to be like a sexy thing to advertise for but like that's the work that I think needs     
7:45     
to be done for certain things to be a little more easier to happen so it's     
7:50     
balancing the raw nature of the war versus things people actually want to do     
7:57     
so um that's a little bit deep in the weeds and it's a little bit of an     
8:03     
idealization uh because I know the cter the counter argument to     
8:08     
all that is um you know in the current situation     
8:14     
that we have is mostly about just getting people to do what they want to do and that's great right so     
8:19     
I it's a bit of a balance but I feel like there are ways to do some structuring of that and it ties     
8:27     
into things I'm doing the show Pro ties into a few things um maybe a few things with plot Twisters     
8:34     
that are happening or will be happening I'm not quite sure but there's a little bit of some     
8:40     
emergent you know things in that space so     
8:46     
um uh I don't know if there anything that might be a segue to a     
8:53     
discussion or let's talk more about that later or yeah let's have a Le Administration meeting next week or     
8:59     
something like that I don't I don't really know how you're feeling about any what I said there um there's there's a     
9:05     
couple other things I might say but otherwise that that's I have a few other broader updates but that was a very     
9:11     
indepth thing about lab stuff so I don't know if you any comments yeah so I guess     
9:16     
we should try to have a lab meeting this coming week because we need to kind of plan out for the fall and um you know     
9:25     
that's always our time to hit some of these uh you know bring new people into the     
9:30     
lab kind of updating initiatives all that so yeah would like to have one um     
9:37     
and I think yeah okay um yeah part of that is like I want to reach out to both     
9:43     
honestly uh UC San Diego where I am currently     
9:49     
um there's some things there that that I'm I'm looking     
9:56     
to discuss and there see some certain that I forgot about it remembering now     
10:02     
like data science efforts that um I'm interested in furthering a bit     
10:07     
more and some things even from like the NLP course that I really liked or like the NLP and and the     
10:15     
the cap Stone I did on I think it was uh mental     
10:20     
health data sets and expanding um understanding bias in terms     
10:27     
of mental health and something like that uh that was a really fun project and I think there's a     
10:36     
a I'm sure I'm sure there's actually like a ton of data science ethics um intership somewhere     
10:45     
um but making some things around that kind of topic would be interesting here too and and fairly tenable like I don't     
10:52     
think it would be um you know hard one of the big things that I'm intentionally     
10:58     
focusing on jopro is like I want to you know seed or like sort of research     
11:05     
incubator and then vocation incubator and like I'm really trying to give very     
11:11     
specific uh opportunities like somewhat Niche     
11:17     
opportunities that may be harder to find um like that starting initial experience     
11:25     
that starting getting used to writing there maybe getting it reprint maybe maybe developing a project but like the     
11:32     
things that are a little bit more um harder to find so that I don't     
11:37     
think that's I don't think data ethics is one of them per se but doing some of that in the way that we we have a really     
11:44     
interesting Legacy in that space already both in terms of society technology but     
11:49     
also like some of the the cultural things even how we've been looking at like research um like there are ways     
11:55     
that could Bridge really easily into like Scientific Management research     
12:01     
management um all the sort of like uh you know the way we've talked about like     
12:07     
what influences field of development or you know we came very close to doing     
12:13     
some things on ethics boards and how how     
12:18     
uh things are implemented at at Tech organizations too from that angle so I mean there's a lot there     
12:25     
um but I want to reach out to ucsp I definitely need to reach out to you all     
12:30     
that me reconnect with them um I believe some of the structuring has changed there but there's still interesting     
12:37     
potential for what we're doing um and I really appreciate like we     
12:42     
we we partnered with both the research uh undergraduate research group at the     
12:48     
time and then some a course uh and that's a really cool     
12:54     
like that's a really cool thing that happened and it could happen again um     
12:59     
[Music] and then also like kind of the newer stuff that I'm excited about and if I if     
13:06     
I had if I could harness things here     
13:13     
um there's some opportunities with Boston area stuff and I feel like I'm     
13:19     
kind of you know um talking like I'm trying     
13:24     
to take over three mared major American US cities uh this which isn't the case     
13:30     
necessarily but like um there's some like both Bost and local things and and     
13:43     
um I just have a little bit more access to you know like like it's like if     
13:50     
you're uh if if you're certain student at certain universities like the class     
13:56     
of one that probably everybody knows about like if you're an MIT student you can do things that Harbor sometimes and     
14:03     
there's a lot of and that's not unusual like there's the proximity of stuff here is just so close so it's this element of     
14:11     
like understanding a bit more certain networks in those spaces it be really interesting to explore and do some     
14:17     
things um both some of it will be more of a mental health working group like we have people doing things in the social     
14:24     
work space here um we have think in the I think that one of     
14:31     
the things that I will sort of do a grand opening of will be the mental health working group I think one of the     
14:37     
titles I had for it was like mental health Paradigm and perspectives or something like that you know like something kind of kind of bland and and     
14:45     
and en llarge but with the idea of what you know we've been looking at the DSN     
14:50     
we've looking at these are the things we're looking at we talked about inside out we talked about uh like internal     
14:57     
family systems and I looked at political Theory recently and um I want to look     
15:03     
more at that and see if it um see a bit of     
15:09     
like where's the the science on it and what's sort of the edge of you     
15:14     
know uh a variety of things ofation so I mean that's that's an     
15:20     
adoped too um but mostly it will be about getting the ducks in a row so I can talk to     
15:27     
these different groups an institutions say hey here's what we're doing you know can we advertise for interns can we um     
15:37     
advertise for prod like products for working or whatever and go from there so that's that's in my mind is things I'm     
15:44     
trying to push forward through this weekend yeah maybe we can meet next week     
15:49     
I don't know what time uh you'd like to meet but we can talk about lab stuff     
15:55     
yeah future stuff well that's that's that's sufficiently I     
16:03     
there's more I can say like more and more and more details but that's that's my update for today well good uh yeah     
16:11     
thanks for the update I think there's a lot there first thing is is that we do want to have a lab meeting or a research     
16:18     
meeting probably in the afternoon sometime uh in one maybe Tuesday or     
16:24     
Wednesday maybe Wednesday I think all the neuromat I don't know if you're doing like the main the project     
16:30     
mentoring stuff but I think neurom match is kind of coming to a close right so we have time for that stuff yeah last week     
16:37     
was the last week we had two weeks of Mentor mentorship okay and uh yeah and     
16:44     
um more on that in a minute but yeah we'll find a time probably Wednesday because I teach three hours on Tuesday I     
16:51     
don't have a lot of uh patience left after that for     
16:57     
meetings um but yeah so yeah and then you know there are a lot of things kind of in the hopper here     
17:05     
we have I have a independent study course as fall and I think that's like     
17:10     
model building so that's something that might be the course is all about model     
17:16     
building well it's not a course it's like sort of an independent study where I have a couple of students and we be     
17:22     
working on building models so I'm going to be generating a lot of we're going to     
17:27     
be generating a lot of discussion know maybe some materials on that yeah that's I mean I'm excited to     
17:35     
see where that goes or help out with that because I know I know that's been one of that was always like the thing     
17:41     
that you mentioned like well let's have a an intership called model builder like someone a title about model builder so     
17:46     
like that's cool I'm very cous to see how that goes good yeah I mean there's     
17:53     
there are a lot of things that you can do with that I mean it's like from data science to a lot of the open source     
17:59     
models and you know like just digging into it and seeing what they look like     
18:06     
figuring out like you know there's a lot of hype around models there's also a lot     
18:12     
of mystery because people don't know how they work they just know it's kind of a black box or you know even if you're     
18:19     
like kind of more interested in you know models for like science just kind of     
18:25     
theoretical models or whatever those are also you have to understand how those     
18:31     
the assumptions that go into them how they work how do you test the model so there's a lot there but um you know we     
18:38     
should kind of I'm going to be in that head space this fall so we'll see where     
18:44     
that goes uh then you know of course you have your interest in some of the things     
18:50     
with uh Psychiatry and some of the theories there and we should definitely     
18:55     
try to find people who were interested in that and get them down the road of like realizing something of     
19:02     
course well even um like     
19:09     
uh uh you may remember vaguely anusa uh was one of the long a couple     
19:17     
years ago did some stuff she she she might want to do things in that space too she she has a lot of     
19:25     
um uh she has some experience there so she's kind of been someone was who kind of was like hey I might want to do this     
19:30     
so a number of people have been like okay well this sounds cool like like get get get to the place where you can can     
19:38     
you know share it and start doing it um so I think I think that will be a space     
19:44     
where more happens and I know we have like morg with the compation Psychiatry stuff uh but also like I know I know     
19:51     
people people want there to be a somewhat Project based thing that     
19:56     
they can contribute to right it's working through that so but yeah go on     
20:02     
sorry oh well yeah and then so that would be great if we could build like a Psychiatric Group or you know get some     
20:10     
something off the ground there because we've been talking about that for a while we of course been talking about some of the things that you and Jen have     
20:16     
been doing but you know I'd like to see this kind of move towards like a all the computational Psychiatry paper that we     
20:23     
mentioned a long time ago or you know have some sort of presence in that area     
20:28     
whatever theone that takes what that paper is at this point well I don't think it's anywhere it's just kind of a     
20:34     
thing that we've discussed but um I mean you know it's like how do you get to a     
20:39     
spot where you can like lay down a marker yeah show people that you're doing something or have something to     
20:46     
contribute I guess is more of the thing but um yeah that's and then of course     
20:52     
the the uh project management and lab management stuff and administrative stuff and that kind of bucket     
20:59     
so we have you know uh we have the discussions     
21:04     
we've been having in the open source meetings I think those have been really interesting especially yesterday we     
21:09     
talked about social capital and political capital and how those things     
21:14     
are part of managing projects so you want to manage a project you have to     
21:20     
have sort of the right organizational scheme like a you know people like agile     
21:26     
uh and they're allowed drop backs to agil as well as advantages but like people don't generally think about the     
21:33     
social and political capital or some of the things about some of the pro problems that they're trying to solve     
21:40     
with those methods so I think that's very useful to have the those things     
21:45     
grounded and then of course building the infrastructure that we have sought you     
21:50     
know it's always a a challenge to get your hands around say like the stuff we're doing we're generating video and     
21:57     
papers and just kind of gets subsumed uh you know by time so how do     
22:04     
we get the themes out of those pieces of or those     
22:10     
artifacts so that's that's another thing and I think that's you know not to be     
22:16     
you know I still don't think we have a good handle on how that would work but it's always a     
22:22     
challenge so yeah we have those three things and and I think finding people you know are interested in those areas     
22:28     
areas or you know we can recruit people or just kind of have discussions about     
22:33     
it and see where that goes or just try to produce artifacts like papers or     
22:40     
talks or whatever     
22:46     
yeah yeah definitely um Wednesday might be a good day for me     
22:52     
as well for next week I know we're not um couldn't FES isn't going to be that     
22:59     
that next week anyway it's going to be a general slot I don't know if it want to be that late or not but we can talk more with that later but ones that might be     
23:07     
good good deal um oh one other thing I'm I think I will     
23:14     
go physically to San Diego in the next month or two okay um I was going to try     
23:19     
to do it this summer but then I realized I think I'm going to try to do it     
23:24     
basically uh more so during course time and meet meet me people like do do some     
23:30     
meet some professors and and some student things there and uh that that can be a little a little     
23:36     
bit more like um we could we could try to plan some specific things around that whenever     
23:43     
that happens um I'm thinking kind of September right now but sort of like a I'd love to have sort of a I don't know     
23:50     
if I can do some like major joint us as the orl event or like like kind of like     
23:56     
the tour of of Nick Wick but but did the campus there or something um but     
24:02     
that's on on the on the docket but yeah that's that's yeah I don't have anything     
24:08     
more to sort of overly share at that point um but I have a lot of things like     
24:13     
I want to go gonna go do them uh well yeah I guess that's the fourth thing is     
24:20     
the Nick Wix or the the society ethics and TXU which has been kind of on the back burner restarting that around maybe     
24:27     
some oh yeah just going back and revisiting everything kind of our themes that are the strongest most interesting     
24:35     
I um I feel what's what's actually I can I guess I can give a bit of an update     
24:40     
from nck Wick so one of the things won't nobody nobody here except uh Brian mccor     
24:48     
who I I've been having I've for some reason I've been having like uh really interesting dreams lately um and and I'm     
24:57     
kind of like temporarily displaced the kind of is one of those moments where like you're in you're in the Time Passages kind of bit     
25:05     
and I think I think Brian mccor was in my dream last night I remember differentiating him between somebody     
25:11     
else and I'm like oh yeah like you or Brian so anyway um hi Brian I     
25:18     
occasionally see Brian on social media and it's always good Brian's a really cool guy he's I think he's doing a bunch     
25:24     
of music stuff lately um but outside of Brian mccor and I think     
25:31     
Sam Caro who isn't is his intern Sam got our new job um also J's doing something     
25:40     
um I saw her update on LinkedIn and she has a a new job she was you know someone     
25:47     
you always expect to uh you just know she's going to do well and I'm always excited to see where she goes Sam's     
25:53     
doing well and Brian's doing well and I'm mentioning them because they're both two people in the lab who we actually     
25:59     
physically met at nck before and my news is the only people that have any contact     
26:06     
CHS at all outside of those who saw that one video is the location for Nick Wick is going to be different for the first     
26:13     
time since I've ever joined them which is basically five years ago     
26:19     
um and we'll see where it's going to be but it could it could be in Albany proper     
26:26     
which would be very interesting and it it wasn't far away from Albany before uh     
26:32     
but the fact that it might be in Albany or some other cities it could be place called pipy which just sort of between     
26:38     
Albany and New York City um we don't really know yet but we're looking at and     
26:44     
for those who don't know I'm I'm a co-chair for the event for the last uh     
26:49     
for basically the last 18 months or so um and you know we're in a stage of     
26:57     
realizing okay we can't can't we can't we can't use our previous venue uh because it's it's just going to be     
27:03     
unavailable during the normal time we do it or we wanted to do it and um so we     
27:08     
have a new venue and that's cool for Nick Wick um and and and also that can     
27:15     
be an opportunity for people who want to help out people want to get experience with conference Logistics um or even     
27:21     
setting up like dis remember last time I kept saying oh we could maybe use moderators for XYZ we will actually     
27:26     
probably use them this year if people are more gungho we have people that are more a little more techsavvy and want to     
27:32     
run a Discord server around the event which I think is a great idea something I've kind of been pushing for we need a     
27:39     
little bit more support to do it so well we have opportunity we will have     
27:44     
opportunities for uh helping out with the conference helping out with the event when that comes up which will be     
27:49     
in April uh but there's things leading up to like we're about to put out the call cfp uh call for involvement call     
27:57     
for proposals call for um people to do research talks and first timers and uh a     
28:05     
great thing about NWI is that it's intentionally focused on giving people in particular women and Computing New     
28:12     
York celebration women and Computing but more so anybody who is um new to doing     
28:19     
events and and doing things in the tech space um and so on it's great great Community around that but that's     
28:25     
happening specifically for Nick Wick and we are we'll be having a new venue uh     
28:32     
potentially in Al and in other some other cities around the area now if it's     
28:37     
in Albany specifically though that'll be a very interesting dovetail between many of our other existing Albany     
28:43     
connections that said beyond Nick Wick um yes the plan for me has been I     
28:52     
basically uh Nick wi or Society ethics Tech as a group has been     
29:00     
um on Hiatus or just just I don't know on on a long vacation uh for most of     
29:07     
this year and I think that's been warranted and I missed it but it is     
29:15     
ready to sort of come back and I've given it a little more of a home I'm building a working I'm basically trying     
29:20     
trying to use like a structure called like working groups and and I'm like c f is is sort of the original first working     
29:27     
group Society of tech is kind of the second one in like my things that I've tried to develop um but having giving it     
29:34     
a little bit more structure and then opening up to intentionally doing things like n or other stuff again uh will be     
29:42     
will be will be coming back so it's like it's basically you know say Open Season     
29:47     
that s a little strange but they it's it's coming it's something that's no     
29:53     
longer going to be just sort of in the archive status and now happening again and I'm looking forward to that both for     
30:00     
like a submission to Nu but but also many other things that do tie into I think data ethics that do     
30:08     
tie into a lot of the um it is a really interesting time to be in that space as always like what's     
30:14     
happening administratively at these big organizations and then you know the more Frontline stuff too so looking forward     
30:21     
to that a lot yeah what are the working group structure uh what are those look like     
30:30     
well I mean that's basically a in terms of joepro I'm just     
30:35     
calling these groups working groups and what I mean by that is it doesn't sound it's basically     
30:42     
everything we already know it's just I'm formalizing them as joepro working groups in the sense     
30:48     
of when I make when there are new things and it's not so much me making them I     
30:54     
wanted to kind of make the structure a little bit more clear for people if they if they do     
31:00     
emerge like kind of around a topic sort of like you you could say like if we     
31:05     
wanted to in the lab like do like representational brains of phenotype as     
31:11     
a working group but like what I more so mean is uh something that has sort of     
31:20     
a not not trying to overly Define the project space um but more     
31:28     
ideally getting people into some of the specific roles and then     
31:34     
having like a space even just even in a very simple space there a simple way     
31:40     
like cognition futures or the mental health working group will be things that have sort of a statement about what     
31:47     
they're doing um you know who are the people involved ideally putting some like I'm     
31:54     
trying to make the blog post for that group all in one spot and then uh you know the the projects or     
32:04     
some indication of the projects um that have happened uh it's it's not really     
32:10     
anything fancy it's just it's just giving it a title and     
32:17     
giving it some structure and that's partly what I'm building to do with with joeo stuff is like where where can these     
32:24     
things sort of be housed and I think I'm taking a lot of I'm not I'm I'm taking a lot of inspiration from     
32:30     
how the media lab presents what they're doing the MIT media lab um and not even     
32:38     
in a sense of there's some in de facto there isn't really     
32:44     
anything different uh about the idea than what we try to do with like cognition futures or     
32:50     
Society ethics Tech um maybe if we could you know cognition futes has a standing     
32:57     
meeting which is is you know great even though it's on pus and maybe that'll happen with other groups     
33:02     
too but the very least um the idea of a working group is is the     
33:11     
sort of they are a thing they are an entity that's somewhat     
33:18     
clearly defined     
33:23     
and uh what was I going to say about um     
33:29     
and and trying to structure it in a way that's a little bit more intermediately tenable to someone     
33:36     
someone so when someone's coming by they have something more to look at then     
33:43     
uh well I mean I guess the old the older joepro website wasn't so bad like I've     
33:48     
been trying to have this sort of like page around you know was web page around     
33:53     
futures for a while Society eics tech for a while and they they exist but but     
33:59     
kind of updating that and putting them in a more formal structure than what the previous J for website had if that makes     
34:04     
sense yeah so like a lot of it's just for people coming by to see what it is but realizing that that can be tied to     
34:12     
like the infrastructural work that's very tedious for people trying to manage     
34:18     
things so there a longwinded answer but hopefully that makes sense yeah so I     
34:24     
mean it's kind of like you have formalization but you don't try to dictate what the bins are in terms of     
34:32     
like the what you're doing exploring different things kind of letting people     
34:37     
do their own Char their own course yeah and I mean I think I think     
34:44     
the working groups are maybe a little bit more directed in their B than what     
34:50     
we have in the lab but like it's it's     
34:57     
it it's not you know Joe Joe Pro itself it could do things like part of why made     
35:03     
Joe Pro is that if there are things that don't fit the structure of the lab they can just be joepro stuff if there's     
35:10     
things that we do want to do here like commition Futures like my vision of joepro is more     
35:15     
like joepro isn't a we're not it's sort of it's more of a facilitator or     
35:23     
coordinator kind of like maybe kind of like incf like I know incf does things     
35:28     
but but like uh you know for Google some code incf     
35:35     
isn't like teaching the mentoring or holding the meetings for GOOG somewh we     
35:41     
doing that and I feel like for the topical spe for for working groups     
35:48     
they're kind of going to be partner oriented so like if there was something at I don't know this is kind     
35:56     
of a stretch example but like a plot Twisters based you know educational     
36:01     
technology working group with plot Twisters as the sort of main partner for that thing that could happen there and     
36:08     
and it could be focused on that and then you know left left to be what it's about     
36:13     
and and doing it that way whereas you know cognition Futures and     
36:19     
Society ethics Tech are kind of already structured into those     
36:24     
groups um so yeah it's it it could be Your Own Adventure but it's a little more     
36:30     
like clear a little more clarity in its     
36:35     
project Focus or updates ideally and then you know they will     
36:41     
only it they will only go as far as you know there are people that do that so it's not I don't I don't have a sense of     
36:47     
I am working on all these things all the time it's more I'm trying to offer some     
36:53     
facilitation of things for when people do want to do that yeah     
36:58     
yeah I think that's good and I think you know usually even in orale we have like kind of generic stuff it isn't in a     
37:06     
project and then we have formal things that are in projects so yeah it's it's     
37:13     
definitely things that aren't really Pro related to a project yet or things that aren't really related to a project it's     
37:20     
not not a big enough chunk of things right exactly yeah so yeah it's     
37:25     
it's kind of interesting that you know how you've kind of built     
37:31     
that structure and yeah so yeah we should definitely talk about you know     
37:37     
how to set up some of these more immediate things getting people in the     
37:43     
structure of it because we've done this a couple times and we have materials on     
37:48     
it but you know just to revisit those so when we have our meeting please have that ready to look at like talking about     
37:56     
the yeah something that um Jen helps with okay uh     
38:05     
because Jen I don't think J I'm very have a very strong sense that Jen isn't     
38:11     
going to become any kind of a like assistant lab manager or um like     
38:18     
administrative person that way yeah um but almost like uh much but she     
38:25     
definitely is and has been Ina sort of like as like like curriculum and     
38:30     
developmental consultant for like how to do that and that's greatly     
38:36     
appreciated um and I think     
38:41     
her uh as much as she's available to do stuff like that on those things um I     
38:49     
will try to get her help so yeah right and again by the materials I mean     
38:57     
we had some project descriptions a while back I may have those actually so I'll try to get those out yeah and all that     
39:05     
stuff and I feel like um one of the things if I I I haven't totally pulled     
39:13     
this off yet but um both like one of the     
39:20     
things that I think     
39:26     
joepro um uh like I would love there to be sort of     
39:33     
a sort of like a I don't I don't quite know what to call it both for like working groups     
39:39     
which are much more like high level bigger thing uh that could happen and I have a few of them I have a few sort of     
39:46     
like working groups in my mind also like demarcate certain zones of like activity     
39:51     
like like cognition Futures versus mental health working group cognition Futures is much more to me theoretically     
39:56     
oriented and much more about bigger models and much more about like understanding phenomenology understanding like     
40:03     
cognitive science mental health working group is a little more clinical a little more on the ground a little bit more     
40:08     
what what is what what are people who are sort of doing these therapeutic or psychiatric or social related things     
40:16     
doing um and and not as high in the sky     
40:23     
um if you will but but like     
40:28     
the there are sort of spaces I'd really like to see things and spaces I personally would want to do stuff in     
40:35     
down the road so there's that kind of bigger scale thing and I I want to offer     
40:40     
you know much essentially what what this the standing the standing offer in the lab is like if you want to start a     
40:46     
project you can do it and and like if you want something that's related to Oro like let's use what we're doing here and     
40:55     
like facilitate that almost like as uh in this case joker as like a     
41:01     
uh like a onramp to doing things at orl and let's build a a project structure in     
41:08     
in the lab around what you want to do like if you want to go heavy into R     
41:14     
vehicle stuff or maybe theod intelligence guy wants to do it in inv body intelligence here but that kind of     
41:19     
gets to outside of working groups like I would love there to be sort of this almost like gallery of potential     
41:26     
projects that are kind of like the cards there's a Cris there's a description just things people can do like like in     
41:33     
in the context of this of the lab like okay like we have this cybernetic stuff     
41:39     
that's happening uh with a reading group too we have cognition Futures we have um almost     
41:47     
like this project management discussion we have the model building stuff and it's sort of like at the very     
41:55     
least something kind of all in one spot or people could just see oh what's all     
42:01     
these like you know cards almost like like laying out cards on the table I     
42:07     
want to pick one up and look at it like like getting that ready in the next month or two I think would be really     
42:14     
interesting and and what we can do so anyway I yeah I'm often like project     
42:21     
planning land we can we can talk about other things I'm sorry that's fine uh yeah well I think I was a great     
42:27     
discussion just in terms of kind of getting it back into our the Forefront of our discussions and what we might do     
42:35     
and yeah I'll think about that more about like how we might present it to the world and so that's always     
42:41     
good um Morgan how are     
42:48     
you it's still just uh Gathering myself in this this this morning     
42:54     
okay but listening things welcome so yeah this week we had a     
43:00     
couple of meetings we had our Diva wor meeting of course and we talked a little bit about     
43:06     
the G projects uh but mostly about some different topics     
43:12     
in uh biology uh we talked about Morag Genesis we talked about uh the     
43:18     
development of shape and uh limb development and some of those things and     
43:23     
it's kind of an interesting discussion uh and then we talked a little bit about artificial life 2024     
43:31     
the conference which is what just ended it was being held in Copenhagen we kind     
43:37     
of went over the website went through some of the Keynotes and things like that so definitely a lot of interesting     
43:43     
stuff at that conference uh interesting discussion about morphog Genesis and limb Bud uh     
43:52     
Dynamics and then some gck uh related things project related things and then     
43:59     
in on Friday we had our open source meeting where we talked more about projects we had talked about we had     
44:05     
updates from uh two of our students uh one doing things with uh graph Nur     
44:12     
networks the other doing things with large language models and uh you know so and then we     
44:18     
talked about I had a discussion at the end about um how you know people use     
44:25     
llms and their work flow and then also some things on uh the sinin approach to     
44:33     
kind of formulating problems with respect to the project that you're trying to     
44:39     
manage and then um we had a further further discussion about that and this     
44:46     
other discussion about uh you know social and political capital and project management so a lot     
44:54     
of interesting threads there we need to kind of pull together at some point but um that and yeah so we haven't had our     
45:01     
cybernetics meeting yet we had tried to have this uh two weeks ago but of course     
45:07     
then we had our uh neurom match mentorship sessions that kind of intervenes we haven't had     
45:13     
that uh yet since I think June or something like that so it's been a while     
45:19     
but we're going to revisit that soon enough and we'll get uh the ball rolling on that and then of course cognition     
45:25     
Futures which has been on Hiatus over the summer and we'll kind of come back to that uh so definitely looking forward     
45:32     
to all those things okay so um we have a lot of things in the slack that kind of     
45:38     
come up this is one of those things uh this is a paper and we have a lot of     
45:44     
channels one of the channels we have is data science ml so I believe this was     
45:49     
either in data science ml or in math or was crossposted this is an interesting     
45:55     
paper of on it's called Beyond uid an illustrated guide to modern machine     
46:02     
learning with geometric topological and algebraic structures and so uh we've     
46:09     
been interested in this in the both in the sort of the lab proper and in dorm     
46:15     
in a number of ways so in dorm we've talked we've done some work uh on     
46:21     
category Theory and development we've done uh contextual geometric structures     
46:27     
here in the lab which are these uh topological structures geometric     
46:32     
structures that describe uh different uh you know behavioral and     
46:39     
cultural spaces and then of course we're doing things with uh developmental graph     
46:45     
neural networks part of that involves topological data analysis and then of course we've done     
46:51     
things with complex networks which have this sort of geometric and topological structure     
46:57     
so there are a lot of themes in the lab that kind of uh are organized around     
47:02     
these things um and so this paper kind of talks about modern machine learning     
47:08     
these different types of structures and you know this is of course sort of a     
47:13     
theory paper but also very practical grounding of some of these Concepts in machine learning as it     
47:20     
were so our interest is not just in machine learning of course but in modeling system     
47:27     
so you know this but this is an interesting approach that kind of situates this these sorts of approaches     
47:34     
in how they're being used in machine learning so the abstract reads the     
47:40     
enduring Legacy of ukian geometry underpins classical machine learning     
47:46     
which for decades has primarily been developed uh for data lying in ukian spaces so you know we'll have for     
47:53     
example um a bunch of data points embedded in ukan space so you know we     
47:59     
think about a byari graph which is usually you know the type of thing where     
48:04     
you have say like uh that's a type of thing where you'll     
48:10     
have an X axis and a y axis and we have data points in that x     
48:16     
and y space and we have points and then we have to figure out their     
48:22     
relationship and it's ukian in the sense that if we want to find a dist between     
48:27     
two points we usually take the slope which is something like this so we can     
48:34     
calculate this distance here as sort of the U the putan distance so there number     
48:42     
of ways we can calculate the the putan     
48:49     
distance and then of course when we Orient ourselves across this uh Point     
48:54     
Cloud we usually draw like say a trend line line or we draw some sort of you     
48:59     
know trend line or we draw like a boundary around it and that can be all     
49:05     
described in terms of ukian geometry so that's what we mean by ukian     
49:10     
space and this is sort of been the norm and of course we can do things like build higher level or higher dimensional     
49:17     
representations like threedimensional spaces and this is where we have a threedimensional point     
49:23     
cloud and the three-dimensional Point cloud of course can also be described in a in uh sense where we have XYZ we have     
49:32     
a triplet that can describe then the shape of the     
49:38     
data and there a lot of interesting things you can do with the shape you know there's of course     
49:45     
topological data analysis but there's also like you know you can drive networks from this and you can have     
49:52     
those networks be you know idian in terms of their orientation in their in     
49:57     
their nature now it's it's good it's a very powerful set of techniques and     
50:03     
representing in the space kind of gives us this power of sort of using the tools that we have of distance and Trends and     
50:10     
summarizing Trends and summarizing shapes but there's more there are more types of spaces that you can use you can     
50:18     
embed things in higher dimensional spaces which are hard to to uh visualize     
50:24     
and you end up in in uh some of these spaces where you have things that are     
50:29     
very abstract and then you map that back down to youan space and you get things like you map um visualizations or you     
50:37     
get uh different types of uh dimensionality reduction visualizations     
50:43     
as well and they're they're represented these in spaces where you know it's kind of a wonky mapping of you know so like     
50:51     
this might be a umap visualization you see these all the time in like next gen sequencing papers where     
50:59     
they have to you know characterize the shape of the data so this is like it maybe like a     
51:08     
umap uh you know visualization and again you're just     
51:14     
taking these data at higher Dimensions you're reducing it down to two Dimensions you know there might be two     
51:20     
umap Dimensions that you're interested in so that's the kind of thing we're talking about with respect to     
51:27     
ukian uh spaces you can also have you can also map your ukian data or at least     
51:33     
like your point Cloud dimensional Point Cloud so you can have you can take the     
51:39     
three-dimensional Point cloud and you can map it to something else uh you know     
51:44     
some other type of space so from ukian space to like a hyperbolic space so this     
51:51     
point Cloud then can be take each point can be re the distance between the     
51:56     
points can be re represented in this curved space so the positive curvature and that's usually or a negative     
52:03     
curvature and that's usually with a hyperbolic space and that's good say for modeling an embryo Point Cloud because     
52:11     
the embryo of course you can take you know idian distances but you can also take hyperbolic distances and that's a     
52:18     
sometimes a better representation of the data because a lot of things happen in this curve space so you can go from ukan     
52:29     
holic and of course this requires you     
52:35     
know a different set of Statistics so that's kind of an aside to     
52:40     
like why we're interested in these kinds of you know uh spaces and these kinds of     
52:47     
mappings between spaces so you know we're we have a lot     
52:52     
of powerful techniques for Idan spaces they're very simple to to sort of represent     
52:57     
uh data and and get these kind of distances and this has you know been     
53:03     
very powerful for modern machine learning yet modern machine learning increasingly encounters ritually     
53:08     
structured data that is inherently non- idium uh these data can exhibit     
53:14     
intricate geometric topological and algebraic structure we saw this with respect to our umap representations     
53:22     
which are these high dimensional spaces that have been reduced so you know we can do this on a ukian space but we can     
53:29     
also use a different kind of space uh maybe not hyperbolic maybe there's some     
53:35     
other space you can use there are a number of options here but the point being is that the idian is sort of the     
53:42     
basic type of Rel uh space metric space and then hyperbolic is maybe a curved     
53:49     
metric space and you can have other types of metric spaces that are more     
53:54     
complex now in in machine learning we often have data that have this intricate     
53:59     
geometric topological and algebraic structure from the geometry of the curvature of SpaceTime which of course     
54:07     
is uh famous you know famously this sort of these different types of uh spaces     
54:15     
with a positive curvature to other types of data uh like topologically complex     
54:21     
interactions between neurons and the Brain to the algebraic Transformations describing symmetries of physical     
54:27     
systems and of course I just talked about the embryo how we might use sort of a hyperbolic space for     
54:35     
that um extracting Knowledge from such nonukan data necessitates a broader     
54:40     
mathematical perspective so you need to be able to think non in a non- ukian fashion and how you know and it's hard     
54:47     
to do because those ukian spaces are very intuitive we're very used to that and it's that in fact kind of the way we     
54:55     
think about naviga space when we walk down you know walk around a city we     
55:01     
often have these kind of you know this this sort of ukan Grid in our minds or     
55:06     
this idian space where the distances are sort of you know straight line and we     
55:12     
can you know there's the street is curved but it's a straight line typically don't think about like the     
55:18     
curvature of the earth when you're navigating somewhere you think about a flat map so if we you know lived in a     
55:25     
world well we do live in a world world that's non- ukian in that sense but you know we don't often don't think about     
55:31     
the curvature of the earth when we're planning a trip across country so it's     
55:36     
it's somewhat counterintuitive at least to what we think about in terms of our     
55:41     
own navigation although it's it's there it's always underlying the actual data of the     
55:47     
world so extracting Knowledge from such non-an data necessitates a broader     
55:53     
mathematical perspective echoing in 19th century Revolution that gave rise to     
55:59     
non-city and geometry an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with nonan structures so now     
56:06     
we're using nonan structures in modern machine learning this is of course something that we use in topological     
56:13     
data analysis but you know getting it to work in a machine learning context is     
56:18     
really the challenge here so the goal here is to generalize classical methods     
56:25     
unconventional data types with geometry topology and algebra so we have these     
56:32     
tools in mathematics we have also uh different types of spaces that we can     
56:39     
use um and you know we can map things from ukian space these other types of     
56:44     
spaces and back again and machine learning techniques are based on sort of ukian spaces or ukian assumptions and we     
56:53     
want to take non-an assumptions and include them in these models so in this review we provide an     
57:00     
accessible gateway to this fastb field and propose a graphical taxonomy that     
57:05     
integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework we subsequently extract insights into     
57:11     
current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in the field so this is good     
57:18     
this is a nice uh looks like a nice paper and it goes talks about sort of     
57:23     
the origins of idian The ukian View which goes back to uid     
57:29     
and the elements of geometry and so this is sort of our basic understanding of     
57:34     
space and shape how we analyze space and shape at the very basic level um and so     
57:41     
you know the Idan view is characterized by flat planes and straight lines and this remained unquestioned until the     
57:48     
19th century only then did mathematicians Venture Beyond to develop the principles of nonukan geometry on     
57:55     
curved spaces their pioneering work revealed that there is no singular true     
58:00     
geometry and you know this is where you get this you know we we think about SpaceTime which was being developed in     
58:07     
the very early 20th century and you know thinking about how that is curved and of     
58:16     
course we understood you know uh sort of coordinate systems on the surface of the Earth but you know kind of working with     
58:23     
those coordinate systems as a curved space you know that was something that was kind of emerging at that time too so you     
58:31     
know something that's uh critical to the operation of satellites and things like that so this is definitely kind of     
58:38     
coming into its own during the 20th century um and     
58:44     
so uh you know there are a lot of examples we could use they use neurons and like SpaceTime but there are other     
58:51     
examples as well the non-an Revolution was part of a greater trend     
58:56     
generalization and abstraction in in mathematics in addition to expanding the     
59:02     
realm of geometry mathematicians proceeded to Define more abstract Notions of space freed from rigid     
59:09     
geometric Concepts like distances and angles so if you notice something about our idian spaces we have two types of     
59:17     
like kind of uh you know sort of fundamental things here we of course     
59:23     
have our distances so for any two points we have a distance between     
59:31     
them and this distance is represented Maybe by D and we can have a set of     
59:38     
distances represented by di so we have di is inclusive and D     
59:45     
which is like going to be like our set of distances so we have our distances and those can be characterized by a     
59:52     
metric you know so that would be like d would equal you know like the dist the difference     
59:58     
between Y and X on a two-dimensional plane so we might have like this uh look     
1:00:04     
at the slope of the position between Y and X or X and Y and we can end up with     
1:00:11     
this number so we have a number which is usually we 2.4 okay and then all the distances are     
1:00:18     
uniform we know that maybe what they're talking about is like a fundamentally different way where the actual reference     
1:00:24     
frame for this is curved so when you you have a curved reference frame is kind of like the surface of the     
1:00:31     
Earth where you have these These are this is L latitude and     
1:00:39     
longitude the surface of a globe and we have two spots here and when we use a     
1:00:45     
flat map we usually calculate a distance that's kind of straight line but in fact     
1:00:51     
that distance is curved so the distance between these two points is curved and this is also a     
1:00:57     
distance but it's not the same type of like distance that you would see here this is actually kind of in a straight     
1:01:05     
line embedded in a straight line coordinate system so our distances are     
1:01:10     
you know pretty easy to calculate we need to have a better mathematics ver we need to have use a     
1:01:16     
different set of tools to calculate the distance on a on a sphere and so that's     
1:01:22     
kind of what they're getting at with this the other is that you have angles and of course our angles our angular     
1:01:29     
measurements are quite important for sort of this coordinate system so if we have these two points D here or we have     
1:01:38     
our distances here but we have our two points so let's take this and this let's     
1:01:45     
define this as X this is y and this is Zed and we have our distance between X     
1:01:51     
and Zed which is XZ and we have XY and then we have this angle so this     
1:01:59     
angle is an angle between the two and we might represent the angle with a one     
1:02:07     
which is this uh sort of the the the I     
1:02:12     
guess you could call it a vector space or uh so you know you have this A1 which is     
1:02:20     
the the sort of the angle between these two distances how that diverge so this     
1:02:26     
might be interesting for a number of things and of course we have in machine learning we have descriptions of the     
1:02:32     
angle between two vectors and so this is where we have A1 which is the angle     
1:02:39     
that's an important thing because you want to know kind of the origin point and how things diverge from that origin     
1:02:45     
point or you want to know how two lines intersect and what the effect is on that     
1:02:51     
intersection so there are a number of applications using angle but now in this kind of a situation where you have a     
1:02:58     
globe the globe is actually going to have angles are going to have to be treated a little bit differently I mean     
1:03:04     
you still have angles but they're different on on the surface so that's what they're getting at you     
1:03:11     
need to have a whole new set of tools basically to look at these higher kind of uh these higher level spaces or or     
1:03:20     
specialized types of space uh this gave rise of the field of     
1:03:25     
to ology which examines the properties of a space that are preserved under continuous transformation such as     
1:03:31     
stretching and mending and of course this is important in developmental biology we talk about the cival worm     
1:03:38     
with some of the things with morphogenesis so you have like basic models of morphogenesis which are about     
1:03:46     
differentiation and you know uh morphogen gradients and sort of the way     
1:03:51     
that those things form patterns but then of course you have the soft material aspect of     
1:03:57     
morphogenesis which is where you uh you know not only get a bunch of cells that behave like different types of materials     
1:04:04     
so sometimes they behave like a fluid sometimes they behave like a solid and you have these jamming transitions that     
1:04:12     
describe those different uh you know the differences between those phases of of     
1:04:17     
uh you know Collective behavior of the material but you also have these stretching and bending Dynamics so you     
1:04:25     
know like a bunch of cells will form a tissue that tissue can behave like a solid it can behave like a liquid     
1:04:32     
depending on what uh stage of development it's in or its configuration     
1:04:37     
in the embryo but you also have to have this compliant behavior of the material     
1:04:42     
so it has to be able to stretch and bend without dissolving and so you know we     
1:04:48     
can we talk in you know Diva worm we talks often about the mechanics and the     
1:04:54     
physics of that process but there's this need to represent these kind of Transformations mathematically     
1:05:00     
and so you have to do this with topology you have to use a different kind of     
1:05:06     
mathematical description you can't really describe those sorts of bending and stretching Dynamics with the idian     
1:05:14     
space so this is where they kind of talk about basically why you would need want to use     
1:05:21     
this and of course you have these toy models such as the dut and coffee mug     
1:05:26     
which are topologically equivalent and one can be continuously deformed into the other so you know we think of a     
1:05:32     
doughnut and know coffee mug is two very different things but topologically they're the same thing and so you know     
1:05:39     
that sort of equivalence is important the understanding those objects and how     
1:05:44     
they're like you know characterized how they're represented but also you know     
1:05:50     
how they might be categorized in different ways other than like the typical sort of     
1:05:56     
feature space that we're used to in machine learning uh so yeah and then now this     
1:06:05     
revolution is unfolding in machine learning so they're starting to build models that incorporate these aspects so     
1:06:11     
in the last two decades a burgeoning body of research has expanded the horizons of machine learning moving     
1:06:17     
beyond the flat ukian spaces to embrace the rich variety of structures off offered in Noni and geometry apology and     
1:06:24     
abstract algebra so this is where you know we're doing things like geometric statistics and     
1:06:30     
there's some citations here from 2006 and     
1:06:36     
2023 there different types of uh uh deep learning approaches of geometric deep     
1:06:43     
learning topological deep learning and equivariant deep learning which is of course these citations here and these     
1:06:50     
are from the 2020s um and so there are all sorts of     
1:06:55     
different so equivariant deep learning and topological deep learning are very important in Graal networks geometric     
1:07:03     
deep learning also but not as you know this is has applications in other areas as     
1:07:09     
well in the 20th century non-an geometry radically transformed how we model the     
1:07:14     
world with pen and paper in the 21st century this will work with machines so     
1:07:20     
our machines need to have these representations so they talk a little     
1:07:26     
bit about geometry and algebra and the differences between them the machine learning data can possess explicit     
1:07:32     
spatial structure such as an image of a brain scan or a rendering of a protein     
1:07:37     
surface so this is where we have these models where we have like a protein     
1:07:44     
structure uh or a brain scan which has a spatiality to it that we want to capture     
1:07:49     
and of course like I showed you with something like this where we have a point Cloud we might want to capture     
1:07:56     
the shape of a sphere we can use eidan an eidan embedding or hyperbolic embedding but we also have these types     
1:08:03     
of things where there is not an inherent spatiality like a umat visualization     
1:08:08     
this is a gene expression which means that we don't really have a native space to it doesn't have a native spatiality     
1:08:15     
but we can represent it with a native spatiality or at least a spatiality that we can nap to a     
1:08:21     
visualization so that's a difference there um     
1:08:28     
even when the data is not overtly spatial a data set can be naturally conceptualized is a set of samples drawn     
1:08:34     
from an abstract surface embedded in a high dimensional space so we want to     
1:08:40     
build these abstract surfaces when one embedded in a high dimensional space we sometimes want to make that a lower     
1:08:47     
dimensional space and represent it on a like a two-dimensional or three-dimensional surface sometimes we     
1:08:53     
just want to know that abstract surface and what it looks like in terms of some sort of     
1:08:59     
description because understanding the shape of data that is the shape of the space to which this data belongs can     
1:09:06     
give important insights into the patterns of relationships that give data its meaning so we want to understand the     
1:09:13     
shape we don't want to reduce it down to something that is easy to visualize or     
1:09:18     
to reduce it down to a idian space we want to just let the data speak about     
1:09:24     
its own space what is its native space What are the spatial relationships that     
1:09:29     
are interesting what are just the structural relationships putting aside spatial relationships what are the     
1:09:35     
structural relationships that are interesting how are thing how do things have a distance how do things have     
1:09:42     
angles that can be represented in not just equian space but other spaces as     
1:09:49     
well so you know we we have to think about topology geometry and algebra so     
1:09:55     
the kind of give you this table here where they talk about the topological the geometric and the algebraic     
1:10:01     
properties uh and the sort of things that we have to think about so like I said you know on the Whiteboard we have     
1:10:09     
our geometric principles we have distances we have angles and we have of course the     
1:10:15     
measurements of the distances and angles we saw those measurements now for topological     
1:10:23     
representations which are different geom metric representations we have things like     
1:10:28     
connectedness and continuity if we think about graphs graph theory for example we     
1:10:36     
often think about connectedness and we think about continuity if we think about the example     
1:10:42     
of the coffee mug and the dut those two things look very different but because     
1:10:48     
there's a hole in the coffee mug around the handle and there's a hole in the dut     
1:10:54     
in the middle we can think of those in term having a common     
1:11:00     
connectedness so those shapes those topologies of a a common connectedness     
1:11:05     
there's also a common continuity do you have a hole or do you not have a hole and how are those things     
1:11:11     
there so we're interested in relationships we're interested in the you know sort of the common     
1:11:17     
relationships in that way and of course that affects our feature space because     
1:11:22     
in Geometry we know we have a feature space or we might have angles we might     
1:11:27     
have distances we have those features on a surface or we might have like clusters     
1:11:34     
or things like that but in in something like topology you know we'll have a structure so we     
1:11:41     
have our coffee mug and our so we have we have our coffee mug which is     
1:11:51     
here and we have our dut     
1:11:58     
these two things share the sort of interstitial space     
1:12:03     
they also have a curvature about them and you can describe those things     
1:12:09     
you can describe that those as having common features so you know we're interested maybe in not just these     
1:12:16     
spatial relationships with structural relationships so these are common structural     
1:12:22     
relationships and so we would think of this as having sort of a common set of     
1:12:34     
features and so actually this is important in terms of     
1:12:41     
embryos because embryos were what kind of     
1:12:47     
similar you know you might have like a a drop embryo that has like straping     
1:12:54     
and a zebra embryo that has like you know you start to get the formation of     
1:12:59     
this tadpole that's going to come out of this set of cells uh and so you know there     
1:13:06     
are different Transformations that occur in development uh but you know you can't     
1:13:11     
really describe it in terms of distances between cells because in your softway you have the     
1:13:18     
cellularization phase where things go from the solid to these cells and then     
1:13:24     
the zebra fish you have this transformation where you go from a bunch of cells to this     
1:13:31     
uh this this fundamentally different structure so you know these are import this is maybe an important way to     
1:13:38     
characterize these different types of systems and then of course we have algebraic properties which is symmetry     
1:13:45     
and invariance and so in in algebraic properties we of course don't worry about distances and angles we worry     
1:13:51     
about symmetry or you know the left right paing things or the different you     
1:13:57     
know different fold pairing of things that's very important in say embryos and then in variance which is you know what     
1:14:03     
are the things that are kind of common to all things and then that's of course a set of     
1:14:09     
Transformations so we're interested in these different aspects of the data so     
1:14:14     
this has a lot of use in machine learning a lot of use in analyzing uh systems in     
1:14:21     
general uh so we provide an accessible concise introduction to the essential     
1:14:26     
mathematical concepts for readability we Define the concepts primarily linguistically here and we refer to the     
1:14:34     
reader to the works of brunstein 2021 Owen 2021 uh XII 2023 a     
1:14:43     
2023 uh for their precise mathematical definitions so this is uh you know kind     
1:14:49     
of guiding us to some of these uh topical uh sort of Deep dive ronstein of     
1:14:56     
course is a big name and graphet works and you know some of these other people     
1:15:02     
of course have done a lot of work in this area and this is all very recent uh these are all very recent     
1:15:08     
references so this is an emerging area Okay so given the generality of     
1:15:14     
topological structures topological spaces can be quite exotic as we just kind of discussed they're not the same     
1:15:22     
as sort of that you put in uh these Clan assumptions we often make of uh in     
1:15:29     
machine learning within this paper we do not consider continuous topological spaces and we explicitly restrict the     
1:15:36     
term topology to discrete topological structures such as graphs cellular     
1:15:42     
complexes and Hyper graphs and so these are the kinds of structure so we've been     
1:15:48     
having this discussion in D.A worm about graphs and Hyper graphs and so you know     
1:15:54     
we have of course graphs which have this sort of it's interesting because you     
1:15:59     
could represent a graph topology as a idium topology so if we have our     
1:16:06     
graphs you know we go back to just draw a simple graph where we have nodes and     
1:16:13     
we have edges we draw lines between     
1:16:18     
them and that's that's s looks like a idian structure it's fine     
1:16:25     
and but then of course you know we want to know things like we don't necessar we maybe want to know the distance between     
1:16:32     
nodes we want to know that we might also want to know the connectedness of this structure so we might want to look at     
1:16:39     
path length from edge to edge or we might want to look at like other     
1:16:45     
attributes so if this graph has some depth to it as you can see it kind of has like this     
1:16:52     
depth to the structure but we also have its width and a     
1:17:00     
height and this is assuming the graph is embedded in in like a spatial set of     
1:17:06     
relationships so we might actually not care about those spatial relationships this might just be an abstract graph     
1:17:13     
might be a representation of different values in a number line so there's no spatiality to this graph it's just kind     
1:17:20     
of there and we're just drawing lines you know maybe like a a common a     
1:17:25     
commonality or distance metric and then graphing it out like this so this is not     
1:17:31     
explicitly a equid and representation this has topological aspects to it now     
1:17:37     
in a hypergraph you have these nodes that are sort of hyper nodes and then within it you     
1:17:45     
have individual nodes and so this is something we're doing in Dil when we're doing hyper graphs of embryos where we     
1:17:53     
have these hyper nodes and then we have edges between these uh nodes     
1:18:00     
here and you know there you know so they're kind of grouped into     
1:18:06     
these these hyper nodes these nodes are kind of all connected together and then     
1:18:12     
so you have these hyper nodes you have the     
1:18:18     
nodes and so then you end up with these hyper edges which are these sort of     
1:18:24     
bundles of uh edges that go from node to node so there's this now we have this sort of     
1:18:31     
you you could describe this in a idian fashion but it's really more of a higher level description that we can use to get     
1:18:38     
the most out of this representation so that's kind of the difference between like you know these     
1:18:44     
kinds of structures that are maybe look at first past to be ukian but they also have a lot of other like topological     
1:18:52     
properties so there are a lot of things you know we have manifolds which are geometric     
1:18:57     
measurements uh a manifold is a continuous space that locally resembles     
1:19:02     
or is homeomorphic to ukian spaces in the neighborhood of every point in other     
1:19:08     
words it is locally linear and is not intersect itself uh the locally it     
1:19:13     
resembles a flat space it's Global shape May exhibit curvature with that additional structure the manifold can be     
1:19:20     
seen as a soft and elastic surface so the manifold is like this sort of spa     
1:19:25     
this surface that describes all of the data and it can have many different types of uh shapes to it it's not this     
1:19:33     
sort of uh two-dimensional space or three-dimensional space that we find theplan     
1:19:39     
representations we have this sort of curve surface and it just follows where the data points are so it doesn't try to     
1:19:46     
fit the force the data into this two or threedimensional space so we don't have     
1:19:51     
to do things like data reduction we have this space that just describes every data point and that's the manifold and     
1:19:58     
then we can visualize the manifold but we don't make any a priority assumptions     
1:20:03     
about the space itself so a manifold might you know have a very complex     
1:20:10     
surface and you know we don't you know maybe even discontinuous I guess so might be something like     
1:20:17     
this and you know manifold has a lot of uh relationships of dynamical systems     
1:20:23     
theory often times in dynamical systems theory you have a phas bace you want to     
1:20:28     
describe and that face bace is not you know it's where the Dynamics are so     
1:20:34     
these points are on a manifold we might use these points to you know have like a phase space or we can then you know     
1:20:41     
analyze the trajectory of the system so this is a manifold and it makes new assumptions     
1:20:49     
about sort of the the metric space it's just kind of like all the points um     
1:20:57     
yeah and so actually we talked about homeomorphism which is of course important in     
1:21:04     
cybernetics because the good regulator can be described as a     
1:21:09     
homeomorphism of a real system so in the good regulator and we     
1:21:14     
just finished a paper on this we have our system and we have our model which     
1:21:20     
is the regulator and there's this mapping between the two and the the regulator is a homeomorphism     
1:21:27     
of the system so if the system is described as a manifold then the regulator also has to     
1:21:34     
map every point in this manifold to some space that the model has so for example     
1:21:41     
if the regulator is a bivariant system and it might be     
1:21:48     
idian it has to take this manifold and it has to map it to this     
1:21:55     
equity in space so sometimes regulator you know you can't do that you have to     
1:22:01     
approximate it so you have this mapping from non- idian to     
1:22:07     
idium and you know we talked about uh good     
1:22:13     
regulation and the problem here is that we have to have a model or     
1:22:19     
a regulator that Maps sort of the topological complexity of the system     
1:22:25     
if we can describe a system with a manifold and we map it to a idian system     
1:22:31     
or by idian representation then we lose information in this mapping the nonan     
1:22:38     
idian mapping we lose information we lose the capacity to regulate that     
1:22:44     
system so we lose a lot of that capacity and it's a problem because and of course     
1:22:50     
we talk about like a model of the system being having to be sort of almost as     
1:22:56     
good as the system itself or things like that this is a limitation of of course models with     
1:23:03     
respect to the system so if a model is you know uh doesn't have the same information as the system itself then it     
1:23:10     
you know doesn't isn't able to regulate that system as well so you know we have of course models in our head mental     
1:23:17     
models representations and we act upon them and of course the real world has is     
1:23:22     
a system with a lot of complexity and our mental models or our     
1:23:27     
representations kind of deal with that by sort of you know pairing down that complexity and modeling it as maybe more     
1:23:34     
of a idian space that means of course we can do just basically you know good     
1:23:40     
enough operations on the system on this manifold but we don't have the capacity     
1:23:46     
to be perfect we don't have that perfect maping so I think that's an important Point that's you know with respect to     
1:23:53     
cybernetics and the good regulator to but it's it's an important point in machine learning too because our models     
1:23:59     
in machine learning are trying to basically capture everything in a system and that homeomorphic mapping is is a     
1:24:06     
critical concept um this is not something well we kind of touched on it in the paper where you know we're     
1:24:13     
talking about like how machine learning models are kind of dealing with the real world and you're trying to build a world     
1:24:19     
model uh as this regulator so this regulator is acting as a World model to     
1:24:25     
the system but there are limitations of course on how much the regulator can be a world model     
1:24:32     
so uh so then you know gets they get into a lot of different manifold and metrics so you know the romenian     
1:24:40     
manifold is the thing we often use in SpaceTime to represent this positive curvature this leads us to a renan     
1:24:47     
metric which of course is like the metric on a globe where you have a distance between two points but it's     
1:24:52     
curved and it has its own sort of uh rules for deriving the distance you     
1:24:58     
also have of course geodesics which are on the curved manifold or ukian sort of     
1:25:04     
version of straight line distances on a curved manifold um and so yeah there are     
1:25:10     
different ways you can represent distances in these spaces then they talk about structure     
1:25:17     
the structure of data so you know we have our data points and we're putting     
1:25:23     
it into a mod model and the first thing we really want to know is what is the structure of the data is our data     
1:25:29     
structure rich or structure poor so sometimes our data is really structure Rich sometimes it's very say highly     
1:25:36     
organized and we're in luck sometimes it's very hard to characterize the structure of the data and that's when we     
1:25:43     
have problems of course in terms of accuracy and classification accuracy and other things and learning from examples     
1:25:51     
sometimes we need a lot of examples sometimes our examples are out of distribution and we can't really learn     
1:25:56     
very effectively from so this is all sort of you know plays into this as well     
1:26:03     
when the structure is ukian it's easy to get find the structure and the data when the structure is say geometric or     
1:26:10     
topological we need to think about those things to kind of get at the structure it's a little bit     
1:26:16     
harder so we generally encounter two types of data either data is coordinates     
1:26:21     
in space so this is where we have uh positions of an object in 2D space or     
1:26:28     
data is signals over a space so for example an image is is a an image that     
1:26:35     
has this sort of color signal which is red green blue and we have a     
1:26:41     
three-dimensional uh representation of that signal so every image has a set of     
1:26:47     
colors it has a set of red green blue values in each pixel that's a three-dimensional signal and we can plot     
1:26:54     
that out in ukian space or or maybe in a 2d space um that space can be     
1:27:01     
ukian which is you know interesting it maybe yields us some sort of uh Point     
1:27:06     
cloud and that's you know we have to interpret that so we might have a point cloud of     
1:27:12     
RGB values or we might look at something like a topological model where we look     
1:27:18     
at the commonalities um or we might have this sort of homeomorphic mapping or we take     
1:27:24     
it and we build a model of the color values and what they represent and you know so that that     
1:27:31     
gives us different types of information that we can use um and so this is an example here of     
1:27:39     
Thinking Beyond uid this is ukian space the way they represent this as a sort of     
1:27:46     
a square uh you know ukian distance between nodes in this network you have     
1:27:53     
this ukian space Cas but if you add topology you end up with like graph topologies cular     
1:28:00     
complexes which are these simplies where I think we talked about this last week     
1:28:05     
where you have the shapes that you can describe in a in a graph network uh     
1:28:10     
hyper graphs where you have nodes within hyper nodes and those hyper nodes are connected and then you have a more     
1:28:17     
General representation which is a combination of say like cellular complexes and Hyper graphs so this is     
1:28:23     
where where you have these sort of topological structures being derived from this very simple graph uh topology     
1:28:30     
or in this case it's just a lattice that's connected uh this is idian space without     
1:28:37     
nodes it's just a coordinate system uh and you can do this again with a simple     
1:28:42     
uh you know lattice where you define things the coordinates at right angles on a two-dimensional surface but then of     
1:28:50     
course if we add geometry we end up with spheres and spherical Co systems we end up with this kind of     
1:28:56     
hyperbolic space where there's this negative curvature aspect and you have     
1:29:02     
you know those kinds of coordinate systems you have Tauruses which have a hole in the middle so you have this sort     
1:29:09     
of uh you know this coordinate system that's discontinuous and then you have a     
1:29:14     
general where you have things like different types of uh toai that are deformed and so they're different types     
1:29:21     
of shapes you could have a Taurus it's hyperbolic in nature and you know that     
1:29:27     
that's that adds complexity uh then you have Eid and distances or Idan space where you're     
1:29:34     
calculating a distance between two points and of course you're adding algebra into that so now when you add     
1:29:40     
algebra into that you can have translation so you can have two two points with a distance and then you can     
1:29:46     
translate the distance to another set of points or in a different orientation so you can have translation     
1:29:53     
you can move things over in a coordinate space you can have rotation where you think about the angle and     
1:29:59     
Transformations with respect to the angle you can have reflection where you can reverse those uh vectors that result     
1:30:07     
from the distance uh then you can also have translation and rotation so you can kind     
1:30:12     
of shift the coordinate system but also rotate the origin point or the the     
1:30:18     
destination point and change the direction of your um vector and you can     
1:30:23     
think about all these things in terms of this common distance metric where you're     
1:30:29     
just kind of transforming the distance in different ways and learning things about the     
1:30:34     
data so yeah they have a lot of interesting points here these cards uh     
1:30:39     
so card C1 is uh just a point in equ quity in space and this is you know we think     
1:30:46     
about like our basic our canonical training sets so if we think about the     
1:30:52     
iris data set which is a set of iris flowers and there just a lot of     
1:30:57     
different uh instances of that Iris and you know we think about the differences between them we can actually     
1:31:03     
represent those with a ukian space quite effectively and that's fine but we want     
1:31:10     
to go beyond that so we have our points in ID in space and we have our points on     
1:31:15     
a manifold and the manifold is something like a spherical representation where     
1:31:21     
data point can be uh you know on any point in this spherical     
1:31:27     
representation so we might have the geographic coordinates of a storm event or an object uh different objects on the     
1:31:35     
surf different points on the surface of the Earth uh card C3 is point in topological     
1:31:41     
space so we have our topological space Omega each point in that topological     
1:31:47     
space correspond to a node in a graph so we might be interested in the graph of a     
1:31:52     
social network we can represent distances between the edges but we can't just simply assume that those are idity     
1:31:59     
and we might need to embed that in the topological space then we have these of course uh     
1:32:06     
different kinds of modifications so we have points in Idan space that are equipped with group     
1:32:12     
actions so this is where we have uh data points and Idan space that have been     
1:32:19     
equipped with the group action so group actions enable us to model and Preserve symmetries in the data so this is like     
1:32:26     
what we're talking about here with this these kinds of algebraic Transformations we can do things like     
1:32:32     
preserve symmetry but also kind of represent the problem in different ways so uh group     
1:32:39     
actions enable us to model and preserve symmetries a group action on the flower dimensions in our Iris data set could be     
1:32:47     
the change of units from centimeters to millimeters so we want to understand our Iris data set in different ways with     
1:32:54     
different types of coordinate systems or like we do with synthetic data or data     
1:32:59     
augmentation we might want to translate and transform those iris images kind of     
1:33:05     
you know skew them in different ways or rotate them so that the model can learn     
1:33:10     
you know what these flowers sort of the higher level structure of these flowers so this is something that we might do in     
1:33:17     
like different modes of machine learning where we want to really kind of generalize with the learning     
1:33:24     
uh C5 is point and manifold equ equipped with group action so this is where     
1:33:30     
there's a notion of a group action to a manifold so an example of this is a change in coordinate systems on the     
1:33:37     
sphere changing the origin of longitudes so you're changing where the longitude     
1:33:42     
latitude positions are so you know this is where we can make rotations on a     
1:33:47     
sphere so we might think about a storm that happens at the same geographic     
1:33:52     
location in the real world and we might think about this across different spherical representations so     
1:33:58     
we want to be able to preserve the information content but have different representations of those     
1:34:06     
events card C6 is point points and topological spa space equipped with     
1:34:11     
group actions and this is where we might have a graph graph of people equipped with an     
1:34:17     
action that can change the way indexing is done on the data set so the order in     
1:34:22     
which we index people does not change their social relationships only the way we represent this data in the computer     
1:34:29     
so this is where we might do permutations on our data and you know we     
1:34:34     
we we have to you know kind of think about how we can do that in topological space so that those are our six kind of     
1:34:42     
points here and you know they kind of give examples of these kind how you know     
1:34:48     
our higher level representations or topological representations or albra     
1:34:54     
algebraic representations or geometric representations are useful to machine     
1:35:01     
learning so oh you have a new person here Trevor     
1:35:08     
hello and Jesse is coming hell Hi how are you doing well just sorry I was late but     
1:35:16     
just want check things out oh great uh would you like to introduce yourself or     
1:35:22     
I sure yeah I'd be happy to um yeah uh I can turn my video on um let me see um     
1:35:30     
yeah so I um uh am studying right now I'm trying to get into medical school     
1:35:36     
I'm a little bit older of a candidate um but uh I'm uh very interested in Neuroscience     
1:35:43     
related things and um and just uh yeah check on things out so yeah there's     
1:35:49     
nothing supering my my background I have a computational background so um this studied bioengineering uh that's what my     
1:35:55     
Ms is in my um my undergrad I did uh I made I did made my own degree I called it applied science but um so yeah I a     
1:36:05     
allot this mathematical stuff I have like linear algebra um differential     
1:36:10     
equations but some of this stuff's a little bit over my head but I'm trying to keep up so okay well yeah they they     
1:36:17     
thanks for attending and of course we do a very broad variety of things here so we do a lot of you know we do     
1:36:23     
mathematics stuff we also do biological stuff and so it kind of switches back and forth so uh     
1:36:30     
yeah and I assume you know Morgan or you met Morgan um I I don't no actually I just I     
1:36:37     
was looking um on your website and and I I I saw the link to this and just thought I would check it out so I I     
1:36:43     
don't know anybody yeah okay well welcome yeah thank you nice to meet you welcome     
1:36:50     
welcome yeah so yeah Morgan is yeah yeah sorry sorry I'm I'm driving     
1:36:59     
so um I I pulled over that's just just to be clear uh but yeah love love to know you     
1:37:08     
know what um what got you interested and you know what what kind     
1:37:13     
of things um you might be interested in talking about um I love I love the name     
1:37:19     
applied science you know I try to call it General engineering but the the College     
1:37:25     
of Engineering didn't like that so we ended up with applied science applied science is great yeah no     
1:37:32     
I appreciate yeah you know I I'm a oh sorry pleas speak yeah no I just gonna     
1:37:38     
say like uh did you um you like have a thesis topic or you know is there     
1:37:44     
particular particular things that you're still kind of working on on the side and things like that um for sure yeah so um     
1:37:52     
I I basically I I spent a a while doing it like a a drug Target Discovery thing     
1:38:00     
totally unrelated to Neuroscience um so I I um like scanned the proteome and     
1:38:06     
found like the drug Target for um inory bowel disease that one could use for like small molecule development um but     
1:38:14     
um uh yeah I have a bunch of wacky ideas here and there um I I feel like I don't     
1:38:20     
want to waste everyone's time today talking about them but um yeah you know     
1:38:25     
cool um yeah I'm just a little bit uh isolated and so you know I haven't been     
1:38:31     
in the academic world for a while and so um that's why I was really excited to stumble across um you know an online     
1:38:39     
public um environment like this that um just it can give me a little more Taste     
1:38:44     
of something intellectual that I could exposed to well that's good yeah that's kind of     
1:38:50     
what we do it's what it's What attracted me to yeah yeah yeah um I'm sorry I'm not super familiar     
1:38:58     
can you give me a little of your background Morgan oh so I I'm do psychiatric     
1:39:08     
neuroimaging um you know so it's mostly like MRI computational analysis MRI data     
1:39:16     
um but um but I I also you know had a kind of you know     
1:39:21     
preds um nurse science experimental P background very     
1:39:30     
cool all right um so yeah welcome again and uh yeah so we we do a lot of     
1:39:37     
different things in the meetings we explore a lot of different things we were having a conversation earlier about     
1:39:43     
like our administrative stuff or like getting people involved in different projects so um that's something that you     
1:39:51     
know is kind of we go from like different types of administrative stuff to topics that are wide ranging so you     
1:39:59     
know you know don't feel intimidated it's just kind of like some of these things just have to like um let wash     
1:40:07     
over you I guess is the way to think about it for sure yeah I'd love to hear more about that um perhaps later I feel     
1:40:15     
bad interrupting your um your leur now oh no problem yeah I actually finished with that paper so I don't know if     
1:40:21     
Morgan had any thoughts about it and we've been talking about yeah yeah I mean you know I I love     
1:40:29     
the geometry of Statistics you know like um that yeah I've always found it a     
1:40:36     
fascinating um fascinating area and you know I I     
1:40:42     
know that um my my own um my own attempts learning     
1:40:48     
linear algebra um uh it helped me to think about it geometrically you     
1:40:55     
know so yeah it but which sorry I I I am driving     
1:41:04     
so which paper were you covering okay you weren't covering the     
1:41:10     
the the paper by um that uh Christian is     
1:41:15     
on is it that one or let's see uh so let's go back up to the title this is     
1:41:21     
uh yeah Christian Sho make oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay     
1:41:27     
so this is the the recent one that they published yeah yeah this is the one that was in the one of the channels and yeah     
1:41:34     
I mean I shouldn't say published they they dropped it in by AR well yeah AR     
1:41:40     
yeah yeah that seems to be the standard machine learning is to get yeah but yeah     
1:41:45     
yeah so yeah we you know we've been kind of nippling around the edges of graph neural networks and D.A worm we've kind     
1:41:52     
of been talking a little bit about some of these topics here in the group and so uh I I mean I'm really interested to see     
1:41:58     
like where some of this leads like you know we we kind of have this you know     
1:42:03     
the machine learning typical standard model which is like you know you put     
1:42:08     
data in and you build a model that's sort of opaque and this doesn't help I     
1:42:14     
guess because it's really kind of hard to really get your head around what's going on um but you know we think about     
1:42:21     
it as kind of magic and so um be interesting you     
1:42:28     
know yeah the the um you know nurx are     
1:42:33     
the Moab mother of all BCI benchmarks the the same group that developed that     
1:42:41     
you know because the kind of the pi for it is in in France um and his his the     
1:42:49     
the kind of um PhD group that that they all came out of is is totally focused on     
1:42:55     
this ranian geometry for for classification yeah and so um what's the     
1:43:06     
um there's a there's a python toolbox that they     
1:43:11     
develop um that um I think I think um Alex     
1:43:18     
grol recently took over um what's it called um     
1:43:23     
I'm I'm I'm blanking on its name right now but um yeah I mean this is you know     
1:43:30     
it really and and there the the Moab paper shows and as well as like some     
1:43:37     
previous papers from that same group like like this this ranian you know kind     
1:43:44     
of approach or you know you know kind     
1:43:50     
of including including the geometry improves the classification performance     
1:43:56     
basically yeah so I mean it really it really does have practical practical     
1:44:02     
benefits and and the um um and yeah like     
1:44:07     
the reason that we haven't heard from Christian in a while is that like he and I I wouldn't be surprised if some of     
1:44:14     
those other people um have a start up here of course in s     
1:44:19     
Frisco as you do um but yeah yeah so good good yeah I'll     
1:44:28     
I'll definitely catch the catch the vide for some more of that because     
1:44:34     
yeah yeah you have to go over it a couple times to and I'll post the link to the paper as usual um yeah so I mean     
1:44:42     
is on aside I had a question about like what you just said like someone was asking me if you go into like industry     
1:44:49     
versus Academia what are the expectations like after you go to graduate school and     
1:44:56     
you know we're doing this mentorship discussion so I was saying basically that in Industry you're not publishing     
1:45:02     
as many papers you don't have that kind of Freedom necessarily um because you're you're kind of constrained by like doing more     
1:45:10     
practical things or you can't say certain things about what you're doing or so     
1:45:17     
yeah well yeah but I mean I I think it's important to get across to people that     
1:45:22     
like there's still you know you're still on a you're     
1:45:29     
still on a perhaps um unrealistic     
1:45:34     
schedule you know like like it's not to say you know like so your your your your     
1:45:42     
output isn't necessarily paper but it's product yeah you know or you know it's     
1:45:49     
it's a contribution to to a product and um and you know and those those     
1:45:58     
deadlines aren't necessarily you know based on your choosing or based on you     
1:46:04     
know where you are with your understanding of the of the topic at the     
1:46:10     
time you know depending on how math oriented we're talking about here you know right like     
1:46:17     
uh so you know it's um     
1:46:23     
uh yeah I I I had similar thing you know so at our open house for the community     
1:46:30     
bab um bunch of neuros you know aliot     
1:46:35     
introduced me as like neurot X representative as well as the person working on organoids and so a lot of the     
1:46:43     
neuroscientists came up and were were asking you know I think I think I mentioned this at the gck meeting that     
1:46:50     
the you know Nur scientists coming up and saying how do how how can I yeah     
1:46:56     
what are what are the industry positions which you know where I can use my Neuroscience     
1:47:01     
background right and and that was a kind of difficult conversation because you     
1:47:07     
know um it's it's like I I don't know how many Neuroscience jobs there are but     
1:47:13     
I think you know any any BHD is obviously you know is a great candidate     
1:47:20     
to be a data scientist you it's like especially especially people who had a     
1:47:27     
you know a very um you know did analysis focused um Neuroscience PhD right that     
1:47:34     
that you know they they probably had to learn a lot of software engineering a     
1:47:39     
lot of you know telling a story with data tell you know a lot     
1:47:45     
of obviously a lot of the the math and and statistics potentially machine learning     
1:47:54     
um yeah did did do what um what were the uh the the the mentor mentees asking     
1:48:03     
about in your case well a lot of the things you just mentioned like they were just very interesed okay I mean they     
1:48:10     
weren't like I wasn't sure if the mentees would be like H how do I get     
1:48:16     
into PHD programs or or you know like would they be focused on Academia or     
1:48:21     
would they be focused on industry well I think just all those things kind of like you know what like because you know you     
1:48:27     
don't know you can't like I I think I said something about like it being the dark arts in terms of knowing how things     
1:48:34     
translate and how you get into like a PhD program or how you use your degree     
1:48:39     
yeah like you know you just yeah dark arts but uh yeah I mean I think yeah you     
1:48:47     
do develop those skills and conversely we've had discussions about like that     
1:48:52     
need more people with like software engineering backgrounds in Academia because we have we build all software     
1:49:00     
and we don't did you see the um the transmitter article about you know Neuroscience phds needs need more you     
1:49:08     
know more software engineering training not that article but     
1:49:14     
yeah it was just pretty funny the posts that people had in terms of all the     
1:49:19     
different all the bad practices that they've seen oh yeah yeah we're pretty funny     
1:49:27     
uh yeah a folder you know all your code in a folder called final and then in     
1:49:33     
another another folder called really final yeah     
1:49:39     
yeah um yeah yeah the stories were pretty funny that     
1:49:44     
in the comments well yeah I mean that's that's because you're not like uh paid to like     
1:49:51     
M you know you're not paid to Main things too so you're just doing it through expediency and that's so yeah     
1:49:58     
yeah yeah yeah and and you know you know and it's funny because it's like you you     
1:50:04     
kind of hope that industry I mean we were we were special because we were in a kind of regulated you know being     
1:50:10     
clinical we had to be we were developing software under ISO 9000 right so it was     
1:50:16     
like you had to have full traceability for for all your code um     
1:50:23     
which was you know a real crash course     
1:50:28     
yeah oh that's because you're doing like clinical stuff and you have to be accountable yeah yeah yeah yeah I gotta     
1:50:35     
say it was that you know I think I don't know if it was harder for me or harder for the the engineers who had 20 plus     
1:50:42     
years of you know coding experience get used to     
1:50:50     
this yeah yeah yeah so I mean it's     
1:50:55     
yeah so that's yeah that's a good discussion to have you know about like the needs of in in science about like     
1:51:02     
how we need to manage our infrastructure and that was something we talked about in the first part of the meeting so you     
1:51:08     
know we in our open source meetings and I maybe you should come back to this I think last year we talked about uh     
1:51:15     
research software engineer that that sort of uh job     
1:51:20     
description is something that is needed in Academia so you know we do a lot of     
1:51:25     
software development just because we're building software to do the kinds of things we want to do with     
1:51:31     
analysis we're building you know systems infrastructure in our experimental     
1:51:36     
design you know if we use an instrument we build something but we don't manage it we don't maintain it so we have a lot     
1:51:43     
of academic software packages out there that are like poorly maintained they'd     
1:51:48     
be really it would be really nice if they were maintained because sometimes they're very useful if you have like a     
1:51:54     
problem and someone else has tried to solve it so you know there is this need for like research software engineering     
1:52:01     
and there is an emerging field that's called research software engineering and it's basically you know we can have     
1:52:08     
people who their specialization is to sort of apply best practices to building     
1:52:14     
software and maintaining it making sure it runs so we don't have to reinvent the     
1:52:20     
wheel and you know it's I don't it's kind of an emerging area so there you     
1:52:26     
know there are people who are giving talks on this but there isn't like um     
1:52:32     
you know I don't know if there's like a commitment to it by I say the funding agencies that's that's where You' really     
1:52:38     
have well yeah certainly in the UK it was it was you     
1:52:43     
know it was essentially the the research software Engineers kind of gathering     
1:52:49     
together to try to you know create create some momentum for for support and     
1:52:55     
for V visibility on the issue yeah you know um at least that was     
1:53:02     
the that that's how I ran into things like the software sustainability Institute and stuff like that but but     
1:53:10     
they they were doing I forget what it was called at the time because     
1:53:16     
um I was kind of helping with their social media stuff then but     
1:53:21     
um yeah I mean yeah it's it's you know     
1:53:27     
and like Microsoft taking a I mean you know how many how many kind of student research repos are are on GitHub or you     
1:53:37     
know um other other sites and you know     
1:53:43     
how much I mean yeah what what role will co-pilot always have you know eventually     
1:53:50     
have or tools like it in terms of I mean you know there's this argument     
1:53:57     
that certainly advisors have where it's just like you know students needs to write to write codes you know we we     
1:54:04     
don't want we there's there's a a respect for open source projects that     
1:54:10     
provide tools for students to use but there's also at least I mean and this     
1:54:15     
could be a bias from the analysis group but you know like obviously you know we' we've got to learn how to write     
1:54:21     
algorithms too right and and yeah yeah so it's like going back and forth     
1:54:28     
between kind of like the educational demands and the kind of the research software engineering you like you said     
1:54:34     
you know yeah plus like computer scientists will come into the project and laugh at you if you are like trained     
1:54:41     
as a computer scientist and write an algorithm versus like you know it's like a kind of a problem of like well I don't     
1:54:49     
know if it's a problem of training but like these tools are kind of being used more broadly than     
1:54:55     
the sort of where they were originally designed so like a lot of this stuff with like topological data analysis you     
1:55:03     
know you have tools and people build the tools and they might be like an expert in topological data analysis but then     
1:55:10     
you go to apply it to say like a brain science data set and I want to know something about the     
1:55:16     
brain is that going to ma is the tool going to match my expectations if I modify it is it like     
1:55:23     
according to the rules of the field and so there are all these things that you run across that yeah yeah well     
1:55:31     
Jeremy Howard's got a got a a funny bit I forget what     
1:55:37     
um I don't know if this was just a recent like Twitter thread or something but it was it was a pretty brutal thing     
1:55:44     
about the difference between you know researcher algorithm development     
1:55:50     
and and Tagle     
1:55:56     
winners you know and and yeah just that     
1:56:01     
like his his great respects for kaggle winners and the kind of the kind of     
1:56:08     
approaches that that that come out on top you know I mean you know both from a     
1:56:14     
coding perspective and from a um you know chosen approach     
1:56:23     
yeah like like he he seemed to suggest that we should all you know we should     
1:56:29     
all enter the Thunderdome to to uh improve our you know to to to make ourselves     
1:56:39     
yeah fitter uh and you know I I I'm not going to do     
1:56:45     
it justice but I thought his his description of it was you know was pretty brutal but but you know like he     
1:56:52     
said like like you know these are the winners like like these are the     
1:56:57     
approaches that you know in some cases are coming out like so much better and yet they're not necessarily using the     
1:57:05     
the you know the the the algorithm to Jour you know yeah     
1:57:10     
um yeah yeah it was I I I usually you know no matter     
1:57:17     
what you might think of his style like you know he's he's got a very practical head on his shoulders yeah     
1:57:25     
right yeah it's kind of depressing as like a researcher you know you see like spend all his time like developing these     
1:57:32     
techniques and then someone comes up and just throws stuff together and it works so right right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah     
1:57:41     
oh yeah I just I just did that with XG     
1:57:48     
boost yeah totally totally     
1:57:53     
yeah so I don't Trevor I don't know if you are familiar with our slack which is     
1:58:00     
another tool that we use to interact with each other awesome yeah I think um I I joined     
1:58:08     
your Discord but I don't know about the slack oh yeah well the slack would be the place to like kind of get into the     
1:58:13     
more General discussions so then there's a link on the website the slack invite so you can go through that     
1:58:20     
invite and see if you can join in um and then you know we can there are a lot of     
1:58:26     
conversations there that we kind of talk about in this meeting and so it's good I'll check it out     
1:58:33     
thanks um I wanted to throw a comment out as well um you know this perhaps is     
1:58:38     
only tangentially related but I I um I watched a lecture um by Dr Tomas Lozano     
1:58:45     
per Perez perhaps you know him he's an MIT robotics professor and um towards     
1:58:51     
the very he was talking about how to make a generalist robot and at the end of his lecture um someone was asking him     
1:58:59     
um it's a question and and he he answered that essentially in his mind and he's been working robotics forever     
1:59:05     
he thinks that the principal challenge of Robotics is um how to factor the data     
1:59:11     
and so as you were giving um as you were reviewing this paper um that's kind of     
1:59:17     
one of the things I was just thinking of because a lot of like uh you know especially in robotics it comes like de     
1:59:23     
composing shapes and um there's there's a natural relationship I think to some     
1:59:29     
of what you were saying in robotics anyways um I'll throw a link in the chat here if you get bored I don't even know     
1:59:37     
if yeah oh oh yeah yeah yeah thanks sure     
1:59:43     
all right um so if there are no more questions I'll finish up here with um     
1:59:51     
another article I don't let's see let's see where we are with this you doing the Kevin Mitchell uh let's see     
1:59:59     
this one maybe yeah this is uh this was the one that Kevin Mitchell posted or     
2:00:04     
was this the other one I can't remember um let me see if it's in here     
2:00:11     
no that's not it uh was this the one uh Morgan that that Kevin Mitchell posted     
2:00:18     
or I can't remember it's it's it's very small um so     
2:00:23     
I can't read it but if you could read out the title it's like generative yeah     
2:00:28     
this is criticality explains structure function relationships in the human brain so I might     
2:00:35     
actually yeah yeah that that that's I mean I'm I'm super interested in that too but but um yeah that the the     
2:00:42     
Mitchell one was definitely like um uh you know evolutionary you know genome as     
2:00:51     
like generative model something like that like I I can't remember the exact     
2:00:57     
title but that that was the the Twitter um I think I just you know I think I     
2:01:05     
dropped a Twitter Thread about that in by bio Evolution I'm I'm happy to hear     
2:01:11     
about the criticality you know I'm glad you know yeah yeah yeah yeah so let me let me mention this so I I wanted to do     
2:01:18     
this in uh Diva worm because it's kind of relate very related to what we're doing there but this is a paper Kevin     
2:01:25     
Mitchell of course is a neuroscientist who's also geneticist and he's you know     
2:01:31     
he's interested in this preprint from him and Nick Cheney and it's called the     
2:01:37     
genomic code The genome instantiates the generative model of the organism so you know this is this is     
2:01:44     
kind of a passage from it so uh how does the genome encode the form of the     
2:01:49     
organism what is the nature of this gen genomic code so this is kind of highlighting that there are some common     
2:01:56     
metaphors we use when we think about genes and how they contribute to the organism especially in development or in     
2:02:03     
just general like how the genome is unpacked the information The genome how     
2:02:09     
does it become like a phenotype and so there are some common     
2:02:14     
metaphors that people have used U like blueprints or programs so when you hear the term developmental program that's us     
2:02:21     
usually or developmental blueprint that's usually you know the implication is that the genes sort of serve as a     
2:02:29     
blueprint to the the phenotype and so the problem with that of course is that it fails to capture the complex indirect     
2:02:37     
and evolutionary Dynamic relationships between the genome and organismal form and the sort of the     
2:02:44     
constructive processes that produce it so it's it's hard to kind of model those     
2:02:50     
things using the blue print metaphor or the program metaphor and so we've talked     
2:02:55     
about programs in computer science and how you know it's like we have this program where you go line by line and it     
2:03:03     
execute something and of course people use programs in in um in synthetic     
2:03:08     
biology you know they use things like uh they build programs around like a     
2:03:13     
bacterial genome and they can do things like execute different functions using     
2:03:19     
bacterial uh DNA and you know a transcription and producing uh different     
2:03:26     
types of uh macro molecules or sometimes even some sort of phenotypic change in     
2:03:31     
the bacteria but of course that's in bacteria and of course you have more complex genotypic relationships more     
2:03:40     
complex phenotypes so you know we've only really been able to get a sense of running programs and     
2:03:46     
bacterial uh systems and so that's that's what he's kind of getting at here     
2:03:52     
that there's this sort of scheme that we can use uh that relies upon the     
2:03:58     
generative model of the organism so they build this analogy with variational     
2:04:04     
autoencoders where the genome does not encode either organismal form or developmental processes directly but     
2:04:11     
compromises a compressed space of latent variables so these latent variables are DNA sequences so what you do is you take     
2:04:18     
the DNA sequences you build a weight and space face which means that you know it can have a lot of different mappings to     
2:04:25     
things in the phenotype uh and then you put those together as a solution so you use that     
2:04:33     
latent space to build kind of a you know a phenotype or you map a lot of the     
2:04:40     
genes to different things that are going to come with those genes so when we talk about a genetic genotype phenotype     
2:04:47     
relationship that map is going to be encoded in that Laten space and then we     
2:04:53     
just sample that light and space to find different ways to build a phenotype and that matches much more     
2:04:59     
with like what we see with very complex uh genotype phenotype relationships in     
2:05:06     
humans where it's you know we maybe have one gene of large effect but then we find that there are a lot of genes of     
2:05:11     
very small effect and you know if we look if we think about like you know uh     
2:05:17     
like uh mental uh mental disorders or diseases often times there these you     
2:05:24     
know large scale searches for the genes associated with it we find that maybe there's like one gene of large effect     
2:05:31     
and a lot of genes of small effect that are sort of associated with that thing     
2:05:37     
and you know it's you know we don't it's hard to to kind of get it you know when     
2:05:42     
we find genes associated with that it's hard to understand that in terms of the statistical models that we have so this     
2:05:49     
is kind of moving in this direction of thinking about this as a generative process but more specifically is using     
2:05:55     
lateen spaces to model that sort of you know all the possible things that it     
2:06:00     
could be and then sampling from that light and space to find specific uh     
2:06:06     
relationships so you know you have basically they're using a connectionist network with weights that get encoded by     
2:06:13     
a learning algorithm that kind of goes through development and finds Solutions     
2:06:19     
so that's the basically the paper that they're this this pre-print yeah this is a very intriguing approach and I've uh     
2:06:28     
I've been interested in this kind of idea of using gener or thinking of development as a generative process and     
2:06:35     
thinking about that more specifically in terms of the representation and how that might be uh     
2:06:41     
we might use our models of generative AI to look at     
2:06:48     
that okay so our paper here criticality explains function relationships in the     
2:06:53     
human brain this is uh I don't know I'm not familiar with these authors but you     
2:07:00     
know it's an Engineering Group with some uh biologists medical people so you know     
2:07:07     
they're kind of looking at this idea of criticality which is this idea where you     
2:07:13     
know you don't have a linear response you have sort of this critical     
2:07:19     
uh response where you have a bunch of changes that you know have to occur to     
2:07:24     
reach a threshold then once that threshold is reached you get this large scale response so it's a nonlinear     
2:07:31     
mapping of effects you get these cumulative effects that are expressed as this large scale change and that's you     
2:07:38     
know we think about the uh Avalanche model where if you drop grains of sand     
2:07:43     
on a pile a sand pile you can have you know they can fall on the sand pile and     
2:07:49     
build the sand pile up but you know that introduces stresses that can be cumulative and eventually those stresses     
2:07:56     
lead to an avalanche which is a a large scale response to these sand grains     
2:08:01     
being piled up and there these uh displacements that occur at different time scales and so the response is     
2:08:08     
nonlinear and so that's what they're getting at with criticality and they're looking at these structure functional     
2:08:14     
relationships so you know the structure of the brain the function of the brain um I've been interested in this for a     
2:08:20     
long time this this kind of notion of these critical responses in the brain and of course there's the critical brain     
2:08:28     
hypothesis which suggests that the brain operates at this crit in this critical regime where you have these you know uh     
2:08:36     
effects that are nonlinear that there are these signals that happen you know that sort of accumulate in the brain and     
2:08:43     
then there are these large scale responses either through like um you know spiking or some output of the ner     
2:08:51     
neural network or in cognitive response so that's that's what they're getting at     
2:08:57     
here and there was a whole conference I think last year or the year before on brain criticality that we've talked     
2:09:03     
about and so uh if you look up brain criticality on Google you'll find this     
2:09:09     
conference and there were a whole bunch of talks on this people kind of explored this topic     
2:09:15     
um so let me get into the abstract here um healthy brains exhibit a dynamical     
2:09:22     
repertoire with flexible speo temporal patterns that occur at both the     
2:09:28     
microscopic and macroscopic scales so you have all sorts of patterns that are     
2:09:33     
you know kind of action potentials uh small micro circuits large     
2:09:40     
scale circuits in the brain and so there are different scales of activity here uh     
2:09:46     
and so this is where we want to capture a lot of these things sometimes things happen at the action potential level and     
2:09:53     
they affect the micro circuit they don't affect the macro circuit as much but over time those micro circuits change     
2:10:00     
enough so that it has a sort of a nonlinear effect on the micro circuit so that's kind of what they're trying to     
2:10:07     
understand here um how to fix structural connections yield a diverse range of     
2:10:13     
dynamic patterns and spontaneous brain activity so how do you go from like     
2:10:18     
things happening at the level of action potential potentials and Connections in these micro circuits two large scale     
2:10:26     
brain activity changes so if we're measuring something like a a EG uh     
2:10:32     
recording you know we're observing these changes but they're things happening at very small scales that are affecting     
2:10:39     
these signals but we want to make the connection between those we hypothesize     
2:10:44     
that the observed the relationship between empirical structure and functional patterns is best explained     
2:10:50     
when the microsc topic neuronal Dynamics are close to a critical regime so in     
2:10:55     
dynamical systems again going back to that you have these critical regimes you     
2:11:01     
have these sort of regimes where the system is poised on the edge of chaos or     
2:11:07     
poised at a sort of a phase transition so you know you you usually have like a     
2:11:12     
stable State and then you have this sort of uh by stable state or critical state     
2:11:20     
where the system is close to sort of a a transition phase so you know the system     
2:11:26     
can be easily tipped into a transition by you know relatively small     
2:11:31     
number of changes that's opposed to operating in a stable state where the     
2:11:37     
system is basically you know protected from changes in state and that may be     
2:11:43     
useful if you're you know if you're in an intentional state that needs to be maintained versus when you need to     
2:11:49     
change shift your attention very rapidly so you can think about this in terms of attentional     
2:11:55     
resources and I wrote I wrote a paper with some co-authors on something like that uh several years ago was published     
2:12:02     
uh where we looked at attentional capacity and how attentional capacity can be poised at those in those critical     
2:12:10     
regimes where you know instead of like you can focus your attention but if you     
2:12:15     
have a distractor in your environment it can shift the system this critical regime where it can shift into different     
2:12:21     
states on demand so this is an interesting question with respect to cognition as well as just kind of brain     
2:12:29     
activity uh using a modular spiking Neal Network model based on empirical     
2:12:34     
connectto so they're using data from connectum that exist and then they're building the spiking neural network     
2:12:41     
model and of course spiking neural networks have like this uh aspect of     
2:12:46     
action potentials instead of just assuming weights you're looking at spiking activity and they they have this     
2:12:53     
output of spiking U so they're different tools than your artificial neural     
2:12:59     
networks we posit that multiple stored functional patterns can transiently reoccur when the system operates near a     
2:13:06     
critical regime so we can have these functional patterns that kind of recur and you know we want to can maybe     
2:13:14     
visit all of the different types of functional patterns as we go through our lives as we go through dynamic     
2:13:21     
behavior um you know say for example you're driving your car down the streets     
2:13:27     
of San Francisco like Morgan and you want to be able to like detect you know     
2:13:32     
obstacles or you know pedestrians that dir out in the middle of the street you want to have those patterns at the ready     
2:13:39     
so you can respond appropriately and they need to be able to reoccur     
2:13:44     
transiently um and this is the kind of thing that you want from a critical regime you want to be able to switch     
2:13:49     
between modes of of of activity you want to have those patterns at the ready to     
2:13:56     
uh Implement I guess way to put it um when you're in this sort of dynamical     
2:14:01     
behavior so that's very different from what we're thinking about when we think about like psych standard psychology     
2:14:08     
experiments where you present same object and people respond to it in a certain way and then you think about     
2:14:14     
those things as discrete states that you know you're in and you think about like     
2:14:20     
maybe what a focus State versus sort of a non-focus state and we're thinking     
2:14:25     
about this in terms of dynamic Behavior where there's continuous Behavior where     
2:14:30     
you're having to shift your cognition your cognitive resources your brain activity in ways that you know aren't     
2:14:38     
like typical just kind of uh linear switches um so that's and then of course     
2:14:45     
we're thinking about structural functional relationships and we're thinking about brain networks and then we're thinking about how those brain     
2:14:51     
networks change and unfold with this kind of dynamic the the requirements of     
2:14:57     
this Dynamic Behavior the connections in this model are chosen so as to force the network to     
2:15:04     
learn and propagate suited modular spatio temporal patterns which basically means that it's forcing it to this     
2:15:10     
critical regime it's forcing it to sort of find the right pattern for the right     
2:15:16     
Behavior to test our hypothesis we employed Meg and tractography data for     
2:15:22     
from five healthy individuals so this was a clinical study where they had Meg data they had tractography which is of     
2:15:30     
course uh you know looking at the structure and Meed which is looking at the     
2:15:36     
function we show that the critical regime of the model was able to generate realistic features and demonstrate the     
2:15:42     
relevance of near critical regimes for physiological brain activity so you know this paper it's     
2:15:50     
very clinical Ally oriented um and you know the idea that there's this leld theory that posits     
2:15:57     
that the brain self-organizes into a critical regime near the edge of a dynamical phase transition or the     
2:16:04     
balance between Global inhibition and excitation play a crucial role so you     
2:16:09     
know there's there's this aspect of criticality at the level of inhibition     
2:16:15     
and excitation there's also this critical regime at the sort of cognitive level where where you're shifting     
2:16:21     
between different behaviors different states and so this maybe leads to     
2:16:26     
functional optimality because you can shift between different states on demand     
2:16:32     
as opposed to being stuck in a stable state which you may need to have for certain cognitive functions or certain     
2:16:38     
brain functions but you also need to be at this uh sort of this critical State     
2:16:43     
at the edge of two states or the edge of multiple States uh it has been proposed that the     
2:16:50     
brain experiences both continuous phase transitions with what they call scale-free Avalanches which means that     
2:16:57     
there is no sort of characteristic time interval for these Avalanches they occur     
2:17:03     
at different time intervals so if I'm poised at the at the sort of the boundary of many different states I     
2:17:10     
might say well you know it might make sense to look and see if you transition     
2:17:15     
from state to state at a certain time interval so you spend a certain amount of time in one state then you switch to     
2:17:21     
another state then you switch to another state and they roughly even out to sort of this uh you know uh standard amount     
2:17:30     
of time or this mean amount of time with very little uh variance and we were     
2:17:36     
talking about last week on non Marian systems versus marvian systems and how     
2:17:42     
like in marvian systems you have this sort of random nature of exploring different states and so there's this     
2:17:49     
sort of uh statistical signature that is sort of V     
2:17:55     
highly variable so you go into different states at different amounts of time and     
2:18:00     
there's no real sort of regularity to it that's what they mean by scale-free Avalanches The Avalanches are     
2:18:07     
distributed at different time intervals and if you sum those intervals up over time you see that there's no     
2:18:14     
characteristic time uh uh amount of time or time scale that's represented here     
2:18:21     
these Avalanches occur at random and they occur all throughout the the inter     
2:18:26     
the the dynamical uh interval that you're interested in so we have these scale-free Avalanches     
2:18:34     
that occur and we don't really know in terms of neural Avalanches why they occur they might be because you uh     
2:18:41     
stress out your neurons that they undergo phase Transitions and you know maybe they're     
2:18:48     
more of them at certain times if few of them at certain times and those effects accumulate and propagate throughout the     
2:18:55     
system but we don't really know but anyways the outcome is that there these skill free     
2:19:00     
Avalanches you also do see discontinuous transitions so the transition between     
2:19:06     
two different modes of behavior or two different modes of your micro circuit are very     
2:19:11     
discontinuous they don't just easily move from one state to another they're kind of they shift very     
2:19:18     
abruptly and these kinds of changes are beneficial to self-sustain replay     
2:19:24     
activity and memory functioning so when you're trying to consolidate memories or when you're trying to encode a memory or     
2:19:31     
recall a memory these kinds of changes is kind of discontinuous Transitions and continuous     
2:19:37     
phase transitions can be and scale fore Avalanches can all be beneficial to     
2:19:44     
memory and encoding memory ining memory and so forth so their interest here is     
2:19:49     
in some in terms of memory functioning some in terms of like kind of thinking     
2:19:54     
about the topology of learning and different micro circuits and how those behave in terms of time and you know so     
2:20:02     
there they kind of get into a lot of that here um let's see their results are     
2:20:08     
you know they kind of talk about it's very much uh both sort of uh talking     
2:20:16     
about like uh uh uh plasticity but also     
2:20:22     
in terms of you know heavy in plasticity but also in terms of these sort of     
2:20:27     
dynamical systems so you're experiencing heavy and plasticity in these micro     
2:20:33     
circuits and there's this dynamical systems approach that they're using sort of     
2:20:40     
characterizes um yeah this is one of these papers where the figures are in the back so let's see if we can find     
2:20:47     
some figures to talk about here     
2:20:55     
um so this is uh the schematic representation of our Network so before     
2:21:01     
learning you have a bunch of neurons that have this leaky integrating fire rule that's associated with them and     
2:21:08     
then during learning You're Building these neuronal networks that are sort of modular they have different components     
2:21:14     
that separate they can be separated out and there is information being transferred between them each neuron has     
2:21:21     
this sort of plasticity that you know modulates what how they connect to other     
2:21:27     
neurons and so you end up with this connectivity Matrix after learning that results from this uh process and there's     
2:21:35     
this process of learning that is you know has these dynamical systems properties     
2:21:41     
basically U this shows the firing rate and then things like the order parameter     
2:21:46     
and Order parameter fluctuations which are dynamical systems descriptions of sort of these this     
2:21:54     
change these changes in firing rate due to plasticity due to the needs the functional needs of the network and so     
2:22:01     
on and so forth so as the order parameter increases or decreases that is basically a measure of     
2:22:08     
the amount of order or disorder in the network and when there's greater disorder which is of course as uh the     
2:22:15     
order parameter decreases you get this uh you're in this dynamic you're in this     
2:22:21     
sort of critical State when the order parameter increases you're kind of a fixed to one state and the critical     
2:22:28     
thing to notice here is this cycle and this cycle between the red and the blue function here is what they call     
2:22:35     
hysteresis so where there's you know when you uh pose a challenge to your neuronal     
2:22:41     
network your neuronal network can respond either by maintaining its state     
2:22:47     
or it can respond by being driven closer to instability so when it's ding closer to instability     
2:22:53     
you get this hysteresis which means that the response is is sort of a de you know a decrease     
2:22:59     
in order relative to the driving factor which is this red function so I drive my     
2:23:05     
fact I drive my network by this sort of input it's in this sort of order it's in     
2:23:11     
order or it's increasing order and then as I the response of the network can be     
2:23:16     
in decreasing order because the network can't respond appropriately to the pressures of the input so the output is     
2:23:25     
and the order parameter decreases and you end up with a system that's you know     
2:23:30     
needs to sort of uh it decreases in order so what will happen is your system     
2:23:36     
will be poised at this sort of critical state where you know no matter what the     
2:23:42     
the challenges of the input are the system can can provide an output that's     
2:23:48     
reasonable or adaptive and so you know and a lot of times the phase transition     
2:23:54     
will be an Abrupt shift to account for this so that this hesis is lessened so     
2:24:00     
you see in the second graph that hysteresis the response is much closer to the input response and so there's a a     
2:24:07     
less less of a difference between the input and the output or the increased     
2:24:13     
order and the decreased order and so here you see that there isn't really much of a gap at all there's very little     
2:24:18     
hysteresis and there's you know it's operating in this second order phase transition where     
2:24:24     
it's made this change uh and that's so that's that's basically what we're looking at here um     
2:24:32     
in terms of the order parameters it's describing this this ability to respond     
2:24:38     
appropriately and you want to decrease the amount of change in the order parameter over time that's where you get     
2:24:45     
into this critical region that's where you have these phase transitions uh and so yeah these are a     
2:24:51     
lot of very dynamical system like plots where they show differences in the order parameter fluctuations in your order     
2:24:57     
parameter and how that respon relates to their Network and you know there are a lot of     
2:25:03     
measures you can use the phano factor and other trps of inner stimulus intervals to     
2:25:09     
characterize this I've done a little bit of work with this um but it's it     
2:25:15     
basically describes sort of you know time fluctuations in the time series     
2:25:20     
series and how you can account for the order parameter um and then this is a neural     
2:25:26     
neuronal Avalanche so this is our probability uh versus our time scale and     
2:25:35     
our spatial scale and this shows kind of the critical region which are the green     
2:25:41     
and the blue and the subcritical region in Red so you have these this is basically a distribution of all the     
2:25:48     
responses and the neuronal avaline just have what they call long tail so this is     
2:25:53     
where you get these responses that are low probability responses or lower than     
2:25:58     
the mo median response but you get they're you know they're rare kind of rare events that occur and so when you     
2:26:05     
get these Avalanches you get a distribution of events um these this     
2:26:10     
tail describes this long tail describes the presence of these Avalanches so if     
2:26:17     
you think about that model of the sand pile where dropping uh sand grains on a pile of     
2:26:24     
sand you know sometimes you get these displacements of sand which are these uh     
2:26:29     
rare events in in the scheme of things but they describe you know these kind of     
2:26:34     
changes and so up here you would have like where you drop grains of sand and     
2:26:39     
it contributes to building up the pile and there's very little change but down here you get this uh critical these     
2:26:47     
these these phase transitions which is where you drop a grain of sand and it triggers an avalanche and you get a     
2:26:53     
large scale change and those are much rarer but they do occur and they occur     
2:26:58     
at random intervals so it's hard to kind of predict but it's also hard to characterize them because they're at a     
2:27:04     
very you know they happen at a very low with a low probability and so when     
2:27:09     
you're operating in the critical region you see a lot of these changes when you're operating in the subcritical     
2:27:15     
region you don't see a lot of these changes because you're operating in this sort of equilibrium     
2:27:21     
so you can measure these neuronal avalanches and they've actually used synthetic data for this so you can model     
2:27:28     
the uh changes and you know you can get a sense of what they should look like     
2:27:34     
and that's what they're doing here um I know it's very hard to get your head around this but basically this     
2:27:40     
describes this kind of avalanche process and it describes these kind of lowf frequency events that contribute to     
2:27:46     
large scale change and the basically that's that they're     
2:27:51     
describing okay I think that's enough for that paper um I think we're pretty     
2:27:57     
much done with it um I just wanted to go over that I know that you were interested in uh Morgan in that paper     
2:28:03     
and uh it seems like we're also glitching out in the um session here so     
2:28:09     
I don't know if we want to finish up with any comments     
2:28:15     
uh yeah sorry I I just got home um yeah uh you know uh Amanda and I have been     
2:28:23     
been really interested in this particular topic of course and um have     
2:28:28     
been you know we we've covered in a kind of separate group we've covered some of     
2:28:34     
the papers that um that focus on methodological questions about you     
2:28:41     
know Computing criticality and Computing Computing things about you know System     
2:28:46     
Dynamics like that um and uh you know reliability of those     
2:28:53     
measures or you know looking looking across the many different measures that people use in the in the     
2:29:01     
literature and of and you know importantly you know what happens when     
2:29:07     
uh in anesthesia regimes and things like that you know drug drug challenges and     
2:29:13     
things like that in terms of how does that um how do those criticality measures change or how do this kind of     
2:29:21     
other nonlinear time series analysis measures change and yeah really     
2:29:27     
interesting I I I I I know I dropped that I haven't had a look at it properly     
2:29:34     
um just because I I was curious about sorry my I also just fed I came home so     
2:29:40     
I just fed dogs um um yes I hear you I hear you um     
2:29:47     
and the just just in terms of how structur would come in you know because a lot of     
2:29:53     
these have been traditionally you know EEG or you know in this case measures     
2:30:00     
you know really just time series measures and so I was curious about the     
2:30:09     
the how how the structure would be uh important in the in the discussion but     
2:30:15     
um maybe I could say more next next week yeah that would be good yeah let's let's put a pin in this and     
2:30:22     
revisit it um it's really fascinating paper I think they've done a good job of     
2:30:28     
kind of characterizing these neuron andal Avalanches so hopefully hopefully     
2:30:33     
also I I'll hear back from people who attended computational neurosciences in     
2:30:39     
um down in Brazil okay and see you know because like like this would usually     
2:30:46     
be you know a subtopic then definitely you know I I would I     
2:30:54     
wouldn't be surprised if there were a couple workshops or you know pre-conference things that were     
2:31:00     
specifically focused on this kind of this kind of work or you know particular     
2:31:05     
measures yeah of this yeah yeah looks like Trevor had something to say sorry     
2:31:12     
yeah actually I I had nothing to     
2:31:18     
say well any yeah so well good good to good to have you though yeah yeah thanks for attending     
2:31:24     
and uh be sure you know to join our slack if you're interested and um yeah     
2:31:29     
that's where we put a lot of these papers so we'll have more conversation there thank you yeah it's nice meeting     
2:31:35     
both of you as well and yeah hopefully we'll talk more in the future yeah all right thanks have a good week all take     
2:31:43     
care thanks so much

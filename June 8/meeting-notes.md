## NOTES
Paper: “Depression, Emotional Contagion, and Mirror Neurons”. 

technically-involved course, most applied course.

concept from the course: role of computation-dominance in CogSci.

how do you involve computation in more normative ways?


Relationship between data science and ethics.

what is the work that can be done with theory?

tie to decision-making. Explicitness about creating, interpreting the model.

demarcate decision-making. Making a computation model — benchmark.

data ethics viewpoint, leadership management.


Model —> Output —> Chosen/Not Chosen.

coupled in interesting ways. JoPro — medical institution apps.

addressing some of the more salient public health, social work aspect.

#research-mgmt. Naming an ongoing conversation. Research space management.

cool Summer of Code, Plot Twisters stuff.

posters for brain conference. Enjoy having posters.

infinity — do poster graphics. Audio/visual mgmt.


Explanability in AI — focus on foundation models. 

lack of computational basis. LLM conference.

* YouTube cast — foundational issues with the topic. LLM Summer School on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLi6wOa1-Q4&list=PL2xTeGtUb-8B94jdWGT-chu4ucI7oEe_x&index=7). 

* LLMs and explanability. Methodology for open-loop stimulation. Good starting draft.

* language model is shallow (?). Paper submission is about building a foundation model.

#music Slack channel. 


Brain Organoids -- Madeline Lancaster -- use organoids as a processing unit. Grow a long time before network behavior emerges (morphological intelligence).  

* morphogenesis --> connectivity --> network maturity.

* contagion in Psychiatry. Mechanisms -- important.

* contagions for Psychiatric perscriptions (Goldacre's open perscriptions website).

* Glazier's computational Epidemiology channel. In #research-mgmt.

Morgan, can you post anything re the comptuational epdimenillgy or the James G work in the new "research-management" channel I made? There's a tie to somethign I said at the start of the meeting I might want to follow up on 

## TRANSCRIPT 
0:01     
hello     
0:07     
see so     
0:16     
weird excuse me hello I'm seeing I don't know if J's     
0:23     
updated or is it it's me but like I'm seeing all different     
0:30     
like speech uh like it's actually presenting     
0:35     
me with like what what stuff is going on but also like I don't know     
0:43     
why Okay no Okay I want to disconnect this my     
0:49     
devices are trying to connect and I'm seeing the different like feedback uh or like volume indicators     
0:56     
anyway not important I I don't know if it's a just the update or just because I'm using     
1:02     
stuff anyway how are you all     
1:11     
right um yeah I don't know who else is going to show up     
1:18     
so all right so uh do we have any updates Jesse do you have an     
1:24     
update um well I just found this I just found I     
1:32     
literally uh have this open which is not an update it's it's kind of a if I just     
1:38     
just looking for this paper that someone's connecting like     
1:44     
um depression and emotional contagion and     
1:50     
mirror neurons which is sort of an interesting blend and I like it's I     
1:56     
don't know how to feel about it yet beded the paper I thought that was interesting     
2:02     
because Marin ARS are sort of that thing and you know I was actually originally     
2:09     
put off by it because I'm like are you the way it was presented to me felt like     
2:15     
um oh well now we know about you know this neurons so that's that's it was it     
2:23     
felt like it was overly justifying some like because we have this neuron neuronal based theory that the     
2:30     
environment doesn't matter as much anymore I like well you know but I don't know I don't know     
2:36     
um I haven't read the paper I would just saw a discussion which maybe was biased     
2:42     
by the people the source that I saw from um outside of that here we go on the     
2:49     
paper just I share here um my updates are     
2:56     
basically you know finals related nothing that interesting     
3:02     
um but it's it is a lot of um it's been a very very interesting     
3:09     
term in the sense of I'm taking one course that's the     
3:16     
most technically involved in cumbersome and another course that's in another way     
3:22     
like the most directly applied course as far as communicating Eng gener with ideas around data     
3:29     
and it's it's really interesting to see them JS opposed against each other     
3:35     
um but but um I'm glad I've taken both of those     
3:40     
courses and     
3:45     
um I I we haven't really had the opportunity to get into some of the materials here in the lab but I think     
3:52     
over the next few months I will like there's there's there's some things that are um     
4:01     
there's some things that are I'm I'm making relable in a second     
4:07     
I'm sorry     
4:13     
here um there's some very interesting things     
4:19     
because [Music]     
4:27     
um there's one one of the more interesting Concepts from one of the courses that we Haven never it's come a     
4:36     
a while ago but I'm mentioning here because it's already time this morning talk about it     
4:44     
is um it hearkens to a lot of the things we've talked about in cognition Futures     
4:50     
and cybernetics group basically about the role of computation and coming before the course my sense     
4:58     
was computation and sort of its role like     
5:04     
like the dominance of it in in what has been you know I guess mainstream     
5:09     
cognitive science and cognitive science and its influence related to psychology     
5:15     
and and and sort of this mechanistic testing and and     
5:21     
and you know very very much sort of both     
5:27     
the actual approach of it in that mechanistic sense but also like     
5:34     
um um it's just the the the the even at a broad level like the analogy of mind     
5:41     
is the machine and so on and likening it to this computation I kind of have     
5:50     
been of this sort of relative I don't want to say bias but sort of uh     
5:59     
I've just been wondering what like my my sense of what what how to involve computation in doing some things that     
6:07     
matter in in maybe more normative ways or in in terms of I don't know like I I     
6:16     
I'm not being very articulate about this right now um so I apologize for     
6:23     
that but I've came to this course kind of feeling a little bit unsure like well     
6:30     
like how how can we use um what like what what is the the     
6:38     
relationship between let's say data science and data ethics really going to     
6:44     
be or what should it be like how can they inform each other what what can what can data science what can what can     
6:50     
computation or Interac with computational mediums do for for this     
6:56     
and I guess I was coming to from a very skeptical perspective um uh and where I am now I did I just     
7:05     
did a terrible job of trying to do a you know how it started how it's going so     
7:10     
basically how it started is just sort of uncertainty and skepticism and like     
7:16     
what's what what what is there to be what is the work that can be done on some problems that I'm concerned about     
7:25     
using like byproducts of computational things like like data but also like how     
7:30     
do you relate to that and where I am now is basically um quite excited     
7:38     
about the relationship between attempting to make     
7:44     
computational like by making a model of anything in this case like     
7:50     
something like in the data science or data analysis of a recommendation for a policy like like or or or a a how how to     
7:59     
how to do something there's a there's a tie to decision making there's a there's     
8:04     
a tie to um signing off on     
8:11     
something and I'm intrigued by this     
8:16     
because there's been much talk in the course about you know explicitness um     
8:21     
about uh I'm losing the words right now but but but there's been a very interesting     
8:27     
sort of um to to try to just speak to the takeaway and doing a very very bad job     
8:34     
of being articulate this morning um I to get my coffee has to     
8:39     
say uh it it's mostly just been this process of realizing there are things     
8:45     
there's creating the model and there's interpreting the model and there's a way that creating models and interpreting     
8:50     
them and seeing the results and seeing how it works can be tied to affecting or     
8:56     
demarcating decision making and related related um like choices who is who is     
9:03     
making the choice to do it and why and in this way I guess I'm realizing this     
9:09     
the potential I don't want to say power because it's a little bit off the mark but I think there's a a use to all of     
9:16     
this that I haven't grasp F before which is about modeling making a computational     
9:24     
model of whatever it is and having a benchmark to assess performance     
9:30     
as a means by which you can sort of triangulate or ju toose a decision or signing off on a decision and saying     
9:38     
okay this decision was made it so it's almost like less about the model and more about the fact that you can tie     
9:44     
well we chose to implement this model on here why and then you can compare whatever whatever the choice is     
9:51     
to previous choices or alternate choices or alternate modes performance and     
9:56     
that's a leverage that I haven't fully grasp the use of     
10:01     
for so I know I'm a little bit unclear still in saying this but like that     
10:07     
there's there's there's a there's a much much much more articulate way and that     
10:12     
other people have said that I'm sure to get at what I'm talking about but from a quote unquote data ethics Viewpoint     
10:19     
that's appealing but also from a it kind of ties into some of what what     
10:25     
we're talking about with the leadership management and everything everything else but also Al     
10:31     
like the there's a certain art and means of engaging things     
10:38     
that I'm just beginning to really understand how to do which has to do with both okay you have a model the     
10:46     
model has an output the output is and the model are used or not used and     
10:52     
chosen or not chosen and it's a almost like an indirect     
10:57     
way like it feels very inverse and I'm sure I     
11:03     
don't know if there's a better way to talk about it but it's it's almost like like the models are nice but I'm     
11:09     
concerned how it if like decision ties to the model in a in     
11:14     
a uh it feels like it's coupling it     
11:20     
somehow in a ways that I haven't done before so that's a very inarticulate way to talk about some like an actually very     
11:26     
deep issue in one of the courses I'm been dealing with um I don't know if you have any comments     
11:31     
on that before I say other things that's sort of a first pass of it no it's just     
11:39     
interesting yeah um and then other like broader updates are     
11:49     
um just a tremendous amount of stuff with with Joe Pro that I can't wait to     
11:54     
not have all like I haven't really been able to push a lot of things forward the last few weeks in particular what I'm     
12:02     
doing well I have been pushing things forward it's just it's not in the visible way um like there's there's the     
12:11     
mental health working group which is sort of what I'm involving the DSM project into and that's been really     
12:16     
great to to see other the things there um I'm considering doing something just sort of     
12:22     
evaluating trying to do a little bit of evaluation in terms of     
12:27     
um a lot of uh medical institutions are trying to do     
12:33     
these apps that are yes like weirdly LM or shat bot base but these attempts to     
12:42     
um you know address the accessibility issues to address the the the shortage     
12:47     
of staff to address Outreach to address these things and I'm I really curious to sort of do     
12:55     
um a a broader evaluation of that both from a what what is the app doing     
13:03     
somewhat tacal flly but also a is it Ser is it creating the services that it wants to to do you know is it actually     
13:11     
is it actually helping people is is it addressing some of the     
13:17     
more you know so what it be it it would be interesting because I have a few people interested in this face and     
13:24     
they're sort of looking at okay is this going to be a from from the like uh     
13:30     
human related side or the public health or me or soci uh like social work area     
13:36     
is this providing a service or is it extending a service is it actually     
13:42     
having a benefit to either the administration the staff or or the stakeholders of of the patients um     
13:49     
looking for these looking for this help and then on the technical side like what     
13:55     
is what's the quality of the actual information being being replied to is it is it just like     
14:02     
in advanced chatbot is it is it just hype is it just oh everybody else is making some kind of LM based gen AI     
14:09     
thing we need to have our own version of it and here is something that Loosely Works in that direction that's sort of     
14:15     
like a a project that uh might might come along that I'm curious about doing     
14:22     
because um because of what I said before about tying decision- making but also like um     
14:31     
one of like there's a I don't know if I want to go down this road but in the future I could see a very interesting     
14:37     
like career path essentially being in this sort of evaluatory space     
14:43     
of what is it doing um like and and and what is is is this thing attempting to     
14:50     
to bridge uh is is it technically achieving what     
14:55     
should do and is it hitting the mark for the actual like real world problems within the within the domain that's sort     
15:03     
of one one one thing that's going on uh and then there's been a lot of this     
15:08     
discussion recently about um like I I made a new channel in the     
15:13     
Flack about research management and that's like     
15:19     
definitely um I feel like that's that's basically just naming a conversation     
15:25     
we've been having for years here like I'm I'm I don't I'm not calling it     
15:31     
research manager but like we're trying to just give it a space to crystalize and then between what we've already had     
15:38     
here for a long time and then meshing it with something that want to do with joepro about yes Mentor training but     
15:46     
also like Mentor like like how to do the mentoring and how to do this management     
15:53     
almost like research Space Management I feel like it's a conversation that's just     
16:00     
um is really important and I I always I always see people kind of coming up on the side or like here's here's how every     
16:07     
my lab here's how we you know use GitHub for our our project management here's how to write an effective paper here's     
16:14     
here's how I like free free fill a paper that can SM things in our lab here's     
16:19     
here's how I try to run a conference but there there's not really like a a central as they're kind of always very     
16:27     
disperate and and not really you know     
16:32     
um connected in any way and I feel like that's another angle of Interest going     
16:38     
forward on that so you know there's a bunch of I could I could say I could spend     
16:44     
like I don't know 20 more minutes talking about all these different kind     
16:49     
of things here that but it's it's just it's kind of me it's kind of me um one     
16:55     
waking up still and two um there's a lot of like uh back     
17:03     
backlogged things that like we normally talk about cognition features of the S weeks reading group which met this week     
17:10     
and um there's just a lot churning and I look forward to I went looking forward of Summer um both for everything I said     
17:19     
for Joe Pro for continuing they really cool um Google summer code things that     
17:25     
have been happening like haven't been able to really take a deep dive into the latest developments yet but like it's     
17:31     
been very exciting to see all that and then plot toysters too like hopefully um there'll be a little more     
17:38     
return to some things like I think I think um all the time about the     
17:46     
inclusive gaming conference um and the people and like connections that have been made from there so there's just there's this like     
17:55     
full uh full up amount of things that are just like the ground is very fertile and and     
18:02     
the seeds are there there's they're you know going to be harvested in the summer basically and I'm looking forward to     
18:09     
that just time up is that's great yeah that's     
18:14     
great uh yeah L there uh look forward to looking at the slack     
18:20     
channel uh I see you know you created it and I think that's good that's needed to have     
18:25     
like something specific for that although you know we kind of had some of those conversations in lab edmin     
18:33     
but uh I think it's a broader conversation I think that's a good thing     
18:38     
to have I've been think specifically for the lab that's been like for in like I     
18:46     
think lab's been a little bit more like how are we burning our lab right but     
18:53     
yeah exactly we've been having the conversation for a long time and and I     
18:59     
think like I don't know if that's I guess I'll put it this way I don't know if it's going to be a big you new you     
19:05     
know project for Orel to do but at least kind of a space for us to throw our     
19:10     
ideas right now and then I might formalize a bit more as it goes     
19:17     
along yeah uh yeah I mean and then you know there's a lot of kind of tie-ins     
19:23     
between research and project management so that we talked last week the and uh     
19:29     
the open source meeting about the um voytech lab and their approaches     
19:36     
to things and then of course with data science we have these pipelines where they kind of fit into research     
19:43     
management kind of implicitly uh and I know it's something you're interested in so but there are     
19:50     
other kinds of like you know management of resource uh like references and     
19:55     
resources for you know doing things those are things we could talk about as     
20:01     
well um     
20:07     
yeah uh there's paa hello hey hello can you hear me     
20:16     
yeah so I think today I'm just you know maybe we'll wrap it up in about 20     
20:22     
minutes if Paul wanted to give an update then you know we can finish up and and     
20:28     
know you know keep it short I I have had     
20:35     
terbly me terribly in a good sense I'm trying to finish two posters did I tell     
20:41     
you about the two posters I'm working on no um I have two postures at the     
20:46     
conference called [Music] brain God my mind is using together it's     
20:54     
called brain something and it's a big I mentioned it     
20:59     
a few weeks ago and mor ofan picked it up and he said oh yeah I want because     
21:05     
I'm in that that week and I have two posters     
21:11     
I will share them with you later I didn't want to now and it's nothing big     
21:18     
but is important I started enjoying having posters uh because you know I     
21:25     
don't know at some point I thought I started down at posters I thought for     
21:30     
students right but um it's a good     
21:35     
opportunity to you know pop in into a new environment and show your face and     
21:42     
say what you're working on the poster interface is beautiful it's called um     
21:47     
Infinity it's a platform where you do the public you know sometimes do the post     
21:54     
Graphics download the PDF it's a new platform     
21:59     
and it does everything you just create the poster dynamically online you speak the narrative into the microphone if you     
22:06     
want to say something about the slide and it's it's not and um finally they're     
22:12     
finished but they're not they're already enough and I have a few more things to     
22:18     
touch then I am trying to finish a paper uh I have I was invited to a special     
22:25     
issue uh and which is by the end Jun on explainability of artificial     
22:31     
intelligence which is a bit of refi     
22:36     
topic by explainability is kind of old but I think there is still a lot to say     
22:44     
and um the key Point here is that I think I can     
22:52     
try to focus on the explainability of foundational model so I can go back to     
23:00     
that Foundation model issue um and look at it and say how     
23:06     
explainable is the foundation model and and then you realize that yes Foundation     
23:13     
model are everything that literature says from Stanford machine learning     
23:20     
onwards but I have proed a couple of notes in in the lab and I had the moment     
23:26     
of um enlightenment saying there is uh the lack of     
23:33     
enological basis of foundational models in my view is resulting in possible     
23:42     
problems which are now being fortunately picked up and at this L conference that     
23:51     
I am attending is are you guys attending the language model part uh no no where     
23:58     
is this oh it's amazing it's it was shared     
24:04     
by by you it was shared on the lab and and so     
24:10     
this is one of the reason why despite being very late and despite me being completely busy and having promised to     
24:16     
have the summer off I come back to the lb because uh I find very     
24:21     
useful um inputs that I have you know have been feeding into the paper that     
24:28     
the work that I'm going to do and then finally you think I'm going to post to     
24:34     
this conference it's amazing it's amazing and it's all been video cast in YouTube so even if you're not online and     
24:41     
watching it in real time you can pick up all the CL there's 10     
24:50     
days large large langage and there people talking     
24:56     
like     
25:02     
um amazing I just listen to you know kind of something is     
25:09     
happening and he's having you know and then there's been Mitchell from     
25:15     
the S and lots of other people that we want to know about so I will post the link you can watch later but the thing I     
25:22     
want to tell you is that have you had the chance to look at my abstract by the way uh yeah I did uh I haven't really     
25:29     
gotten into it though uh did you submit that to the uh special     
25:36     
issue yeah I did submit it and am I supposed to get an answer from     
25:41     
them you might yeah you might nudge them uh but they'll take a while to respond     
25:47     
to you I guess uh but who did you send it to or did you submit it so yeah well     
25:53     
I submitted it bya the form and I received the acknowledgement that they had been submitted I know he has been     
25:59     
sent but then I didn't take any further action so I suppose they will say yes     
26:05     
will I get your right the paper or maybe I I mean I'm just some sometimes the     
26:10     
abstr is not set I suppose they would let me know if that's the case I guess yeah yeah I     
26:17     
would wait a while and then if you don't hear back for a while you could nudge them and see if they're you know if they     
26:24     
still want to do it so do you have any to say about the abstract itself I mean it's It Was     
26:31     
Written very quickly yeah but I I took the chance to throw out all the points     
26:36     
that I want all the things that I wanted to say and of course if it is accepted we can talk about it whenever you have     
26:42     
time and pick out things that we want to develop and drop the things we don't want to develop and have good discussion     
26:49     
but if you have any immediate feedback that would be great yeah I don't really have any     
26:54     
immediate feedback uh but yeah if we can like break it down into pieces you know     
27:01     
generally like once you get to the uh outline stage then it makes it easier to     
27:07     
make comments on but yeah it looks interesting uh you know again you have to like parse it out and figure out what     
27:15     
parts you want to emphasize and you know work from     
27:21     
there so I think the bottom line is that this there is there issues with the kale     
27:27     
the foundation issues is chaos the is not understood I think you     
27:34     
know is maybe is not it's not communicated properly and you know I     
27:39     
don't know just that's very foundational but let's talk about it as let's talk to accept it and then we can talk about it     
27:48     
and and we can develop it in whatever way you know contributors will feel like     
27:55     
Jaz do you have anything to say about the the you had a chance     
28:03     
to short answer is no um is in my finals     
28:08     
era so I don't have haven't looked at in at all okay sorry to impose that one and um     
28:18     
that's fine so um that you know let's hope it's accepted open up discussion     
28:25     
and oh yes je the summer school Sky writing press that's important one and     
28:31     
it was shared by I think Morgan who come on hello     
28:37     
Morgan yeah that that's what you were referencing earlier yeah that is and and I been I     
28:44     
call on to that and it's massively important event for me mostly because     
28:51     
it's it's a 10 days pack and it's um     
28:56     
it's um is webcast on YouTube you see for me that is very important because this this     
29:04     
talk and some of the talks are you know could maybe a little bit more to be honest I mean unless you're really     
29:09     
interested in everything some of them may be less interesting than others you know the whole point of this conference     
29:17     
is very important it feeds directly into some of the things that I'm doing about     
29:23     
inability so basically when you go to this conference and you listen to the thought to realize that despite being     
29:32     
deeply involved in machine learning and computation well     
29:38     
beyond where I am uh these people are coming to grips that you know there are limitations as     
29:46     
to what we're doing there are risks and uh and there in some of it it could well     
29:51     
be all a big waste of time it's good to hear that people I mean people are happy     
29:57     
to present their work and their result but I think it's coming out that this     
30:02     
machine learning and AI could be a little bit sometimes um self you know it's a     
30:09     
nameing itself it's an interesting thing to do when people can afford energy     
30:15     
learn but it is I think the state of the art in the field so it is worth keeping     
30:20     
an eye on and I think that's that's about it it from me and I will wait for     
30:27     
the for me the next big thing now is doing my making my own deadline ining     
30:33     
this conference that hopefully Morgan is going to and um and see if this AB is accepted to     
30:41     
work with to in is small still use paper in some other publication so thank you     
30:49     
for for giving me this place to you oh yeah no problem I also saw that you had     
30:55     
posted some things on the uh I guess uh Hussein's idea on ethical feedback and     
31:04     
stimulation and he posted those yeah where is he let me grab     
31:13     
him is not here I'm joking basically hin H me with the direct message saying hey     
31:20     
you wanted to have I suggested same bu of     
31:33     
paper this and I said we need methodology yeah are to much stuff too     
31:39     
many and he bology which I think WR     
31:51     
by and the way why it is because now we     
31:56     
know that that you know it's like I have done it before you to write my pit uh     
32:02     
and I'm just encouraging I think it could be that we need to have a b resch but also it's a good start I mean it's a     
32:09     
great half draft we now need to drill into those points which are the the two     
32:15     
things that the methodology paper theology should do are not described     
32:23     
because the language model was shallow I have tried I have hard to get into the     
32:29     
language [Music] model I want provide for me and it     
32:34     
doesn't go into any level of di so that's the human I mean you can     
32:40     
use that and then you have to do bit of work yourself and then maybe uh uh I     
32:48     
would also restyle the the Tex because it's now so obvious that that's the     
32:54     
Gemini style it's so recognizable don't you think yeah yeah     
33:01     
yeah yeah yeah it looks interesting I I I don't know you had a you you had kind     
33:08     
of proposed some things in the post in uh the slack so uh you know it looks like there a     
33:16     
bunch of action items in there and if people want to participate they can do     
33:21     
so uh but yeah we might have to have like a we might have to spend some     
33:27     
devote some time to it where we you know kind of walk through some of those     
33:33     
things sure feel IGN them I have a very intense verst of     
33:41     
creative ideas I am hyper one of I have a you know hyperactive brain and some of     
33:48     
them are worth Ming down so I put them out and some of them I may well go back     
33:54     
to later or if you like or if anyone likes them like you know to do the language model based on the rap lyrics I     
34:01     
think that's mindblowing idea whether I have we have the time when that's     
34:08     
another isue but I write it down sometimes just for ponics so that I will remember I said it otherwise it just     
34:15     
goes into the bucket of things that are just thought and never actually so at Le     
34:21     
it's an Ence don't feel that you have to follow on any of the things that I say I     
34:28     
rush them for my own Rec but if anything stimulates your own your own those     
34:35     
[Music] Spikes all right well that sounds good     
34:40     
thank you and I'll take a deeper look at your abstract too because I I mean I looked     
34:47     
at it I didn't really dig into it you know but I think the conversation will     
34:52     
come like after we you know maybe outline it and figure out how you can     
34:58     
actually write it out because that's always the way it you know that's always     
35:03     
the way it seems to work out yeah yeah know Jess yeah I could it could be I     
35:09     
haven't even looked at it again I just done it there and then I I read it the     
35:15     
next day to make sure it wasn't too terrible at least that they could interpret it and then but um that's it     
35:23     
you know it's just there it's there and it's there now it's editable so even if whatever purpose annotate with     
35:32     
thoughts and it needs a lot of collaboration and I want to say one thing on that in that paper Abra I could     
35:40     
say that I'm going to write a foundation uh which is probably not in     
35:48     
the sense that I don't think I can we can write by months without I don't have to     
35:56     
do that in but um a reference     
36:01     
model for a foundation model yes so you know I may have to rephrase and some of     
36:08     
the things I I set up to do but at least it gives you Direction yeah yeah that sounds     
36:17     
great uh again yeah it's you know sometimes you get overly ambitious but     
36:23     
sometimes there are ways to like kind of you do have to write out a foundation model I think for this kind of paper uh     
36:29     
you just have to like hit the points and how that might be done or what are the major issues in the field because I     
36:35     
think what they're looking for is to take sort of the idea of like a lot of     
36:42     
what's going on in AI uh and to sort of figure out you know how do we think about world     
36:49     
models how do we think about uh intelligence but like you know we want to cast this sort of more theoretically     
36:58     
so or cast this in more of a way to kind of think about those higher level things     
37:04     
so a lot of AI researches is generating papers and benchmarks and things like     
37:10     
that and people haven't really stopped reflect on what's going on uh and so that's I think that's what     
37:18     
they're trying for uh I know the the call for papers wasn't like really     
37:23     
focused and I think that's kind of why because is it's just really about they     
37:29     
want to get some ideas out there but at the same time you want to make it a very focused effort and say this is what we     
37:37     
can do in the future but you know we don't have to like build     
37:43     
this definitive thing that's you know because it's like it's a special issue     
37:50     
it's not it's notable I realize I overstated but but but it's just yeah I     
37:56     
mean we can try if it's interesting and if we have discussions and can build around it     
38:03     
I think there are some good ideas and we can go as far as catching them down as the architectural pillars or     
38:11     
something yeah all right that sounds     
38:19     
good uh hello Morgan     
38:29     
good morning good morning uh I think that's I just wanted     
38:35     
uh today I just wanted to give you know see if people had updates and do a check-in I didn't really want to do a     
38:40     
whole meeting today so uh you sound a bit under the weather     
38:46     
yeah that's I hear you it's okay yeah I'm I'm fine I     
38:56     
did what do you anyways yeah thanks for giving me updates and we'll we'll keep going on uh checking in on slack thanks     
39:03     
for creating that new Channel Jesse yeah I'm looking I I I'm assume     
39:09     
we're gonna wrap up now basically right like I so yeah okay um my only my I also     
39:17     
I want to say oh sorry sorry I W to say one more thing I also created a new channel it's a music channel a what have     
39:24     
you seen it which one Music Channel music I yeah it's a soundtrack I because I     
39:32     
don't know you but music resonates with with their brains in a big way and uh I     
39:39     
I find uh music both stimulating and the     
39:44     
the response to to stimuli so sometimes I have some scholarly or work related     
39:51     
talks and some music comes up and when I share it with people people seem to     
39:56     
enjoy the flow so I I have opened the music channel I have not asked     
40:01     
permission to Jazz our lab manager can we have music and it was related to the     
40:08     
rap so is it okay if this music is a little bit uh use explicit language I     
40:15     
normally listen to very decent things including church music like a lot but occasionally there is a rap track and     
40:23     
it's a r so that's I wanted to just mention that     
40:30     
um youall defer it brly about music in general but     
40:39     
um yeah I mean if if there's some research you want to organize around that that would be fine just make sure     
40:45     
you invite people to it I don't go sorry you have to invite people     
40:51     
to it um to start it off because it doesn't automatically do that so people won't know     
40:57     
there yeah I would I would invite people to it like you can invite Bradley and me     
41:03     
and whoever if you want to invite people and then maybe make a small a brief introduction about what the channel is     
41:09     
and then post it in general kind of like what I just did with the other one uh the research management one like you can     
41:16     
just explain it or give it some context and let know about it because people will have no idea unless they go all the     
41:23     
way into the channel browser and look for it um so that's sort of the town of     
41:28     
making new channels in the way that we have S right okay I I would do that thank you for your advice no problem     
41:35     
yeah it sounds interesting yes I think there I think there's an appropriate place for as a     
41:41     
child of like 90s um what what was what was the 90s gangster rap um has a     
41:49     
special place in my heart so but yeah I'm curious what you do with it and I I didn't get to look at I didn't get to     
41:55     
look at the um you made a post about the music project     
42:02     
as well which sounds interesting but I look forward to looking excuse me     
42:08     
looking at that a bit more um in a week or so myself so it's good I mean all the     
42:14     
I think I think I think the the high level message is yes thank you for doing all this stuff and you know you're     
42:21     
learning the ways to talk about it in the lab and I appreciate that you're doing that and and and I think you know     
42:27     
I want to encourage you to keep um you know sharing ideas and and developing projects because that's the     
42:33     
something we is a great space to do that here because we offer a space for that and you know eventually the prodject can     
42:40     
develop um over time so it's good to do that and encourage that for anyone to     
42:46     
watching this that you can you have the opportunity to do that too     
42:52     
yeah yeah so Jesse do you want some say some last minute things     
42:58     
oh um I mean I probably said most of it earlier     
43:04     
um just uh I'm hoping I don't know if it's going to be next week but the following     
43:10     
we after that might be the return of commiss Futures not the return of the map song but the return of commition     
43:18     
futures um is is it's still there and I appreciate people kind of thinking with     
43:23     
that I've been thinking quite a bit about um how to structure structure it and to     
43:30     
pursue some some of the stuff like the main state will probably still be just the reading you know reading group as it     
43:35     
has been but um oh speaking of that I I     
43:40     
saw uh Tom Tom froze okay at talking to     
43:46     
Levin about eruption Theory and put that in there so I haven't I haven't gotten into that yet but I think that'll be you     
43:53     
know in in a in a coming soon attraction that looks fun get into um yeah when I have time I want to     
44:00     
look at the it's nice as Paula said um the LM summer school has their     
44:07     
recordings on YouTube and some of them are very good too lens they're Josh tenom I really want to look at the Josh     
44:12     
tenom one I haven't really the inter with Josh tenon for a while um and     
44:17     
Melanie Mitchell's on there too Blake Richards or Richards blink     
44:23     
um names are confusing with me sometimes in the way l out here and then Wolf's     
44:28     
there um and some many other people that'll be cool um and     
44:34     
then um that's pretty much it um I I there's     
44:42     
other summer plans that are kind of on the verge but I'm not sure yet so hopefully more more updates for next     
44:49     
week but um yeah I'm just I'm kind of I'm kind of coasting into finals land     
44:56     
and passing through it and then on the other side will be a fun summer so forward of that     
45:04     
yeah that's all for me all right H well oh go ahead Morgan yeah sorry um sorry I     
45:12     
was late and um sorry you're not feeling well there Bradley um the uh brain organizes uh was there's     
45:23     
a couple things in there one is just a a talk from Lancaster which of course is     
45:29     
is you know required viewing um and really interesting um you know more more     
45:38     
of an overview but um but she makes some great points um especially about     
45:44     
organoid intelligence so this is you know how to potentially use organoids as     
45:50     
a um as a you know pre-processor or     
45:57     
processing unit if you will you know yeah in a in a somewhat neuromorphic way     
46:02     
and and her her point is that um what     
46:08     
she sees from looking at organoid development is that     
46:14     
um you've you've got to grow them a long time before you're G to get anything     
46:21     
like Network behavior and and I I think that's that's something that's come out     
46:26     
in a lot lot of a lot of cases uh from from a lot of groups um uh but hasn't     
46:33     
been really incorporated into the the people who are focused on organoid     
46:39     
intelligence um which is is somewhat of     
46:45     
a you know it's it's one thing to talk about um you know all these great Energy     
46:50     
Efficiency properties of of organoids and things like that but you know doesn't does doesn't sit too well     
46:58     
interesting but how long well again it's going to depend but     
47:04     
but I think what um it's going to depend on what your you know your specifications are but you know her     
47:12     
certainly her main point is that you know you you you're gonna you're gonna     
47:18     
want something that's like you know in Udo time um to get you know real real     
47:26     
Network properties and which which was which was very much the point of     
47:33     
um you know which was to some degree the the original point from from Alison     
47:38     
nitry and um and Bradley vek you know that that um that that's when they     
47:46     
started seeing you know spontaneous oscillations and and you can you can     
47:53     
certainly imagine or you know let's not so spontaneous like but in endogenous you know structural     
48:02     
activity um and and that um would     
48:07     
certainly make sense that you know from from kind of neurophysics standpoint a lot of you know Alpha and and things     
48:16     
things like that you know are are derived once you're starting to see kind     
48:21     
of network properties emerge um so that that that was that was     
48:27     
and just her her overview in general about you know like the State of the     
48:32     
State of cerebral organoids as in all things um was was um always um always     
48:41     
great um the there I put in another talk there from um Alonso Arius oh um yeah I     
48:52     
thought I thought that was really good too you know it's um     
48:57     
he you know for those of us who who certainly um enjoy Dennis Noble's um     
49:06     
critiques if you will modern synthesis uh you know     
49:12     
Alonso Aras has a lot of good push back on that um and you know he he has a lot     
49:22     
of respect but a lot of push back and I thought that that that was a really it     
49:28     
was a really nice um overview of kind of both you know his career and the     
49:35     
development of of you know molecular biology in the past you know 30 40 years     
49:41     
um that was that was great to see and and great to see where kind of he saw     
49:47     
you know cracks and things and and you know good good areas that um that that     
49:54     
he thinks would be you know in which it would be fruitful to focus so that that that was really nice     
50:03     
I I'm into his book that he wrote on cells like I guess he's has     
50:09     
this interest in like he has this hashtag uh not by jeans alone or     
50:15     
something and it's like this is on the cell so you can you can see I mean the host was the host kept on trying to get     
50:23     
him to to you know place place like Michael Levan Dennis Noble and who else     
50:32     
it was like so where on the Spectrum are you relative to these gu you know right     
50:37     
right which is like yeah you know and he     
50:43     
um yeah so he he wasn't he wasn't looking to pick a fight but he he he did     
50:50     
he did have plenty of push back you know so he he was the first to say like Lan does a lot of experiments that haven't     
50:56     
been repli K and it wasn't that wasn't to say he     
51:02     
didn't believe them he was just like like you're you you know you're     
51:07     
definitely you're definitely at the Forefront if nobody's even trying to replicate you right or the people who     
51:14     
have you know aren't sure that they've they're doing it right or they're not seeing the same thing and and I think     
51:22     
that does it it's yeah it it should give     
51:28     
us especially with um just the problems     
51:34     
of you know like even mad mad Lancaster talking about the problems of     
51:40     
reproducibility in in organoids but like this this can be this can be without any     
51:47     
you know Bad actors this can just this can honestly be a a problem of you know     
51:54     
um yeah just preps or you know different different um     
52:00     
different takes on on various problems and you know that that this really does     
52:07     
need more you know it just needs more people looking at it to flesh these things out um and with regard to Dennis     
52:15     
Noble it was definitely like he wants to you know this idea that     
52:23     
um phys you know for him like you said like like alons the the the cell is     
52:33     
the unit of analysis is the appropriate scope yeah or you know yeah and and um     
52:42     
you know which is which is also certainly you know why he has an affinity to Le even though he's still     
52:48     
not sure that yeah everything's been everything's replicable there um but um     
52:56     
was definitely it was definitely worth going over i' I'd love to read his books then if there was some good uh he talked     
53:02     
about some foundational papers he's written and and it was interesting to to hear that he started as a biophysicist     
53:09     
oh yeah but it was like I I started I started too early right there wasn't     
53:17     
enough physics that was relevant so it sounded like you did a lot of chemistry yeah um     
53:23     
and yeah there was um also just a well one just quick last thing I um I     
53:33     
saw that just put in something about contagious depression or you know     
53:39     
contagion in Psychiatry is is kind of hot right now um and uh I just wanted to     
53:48     
say one thing which is like it it is it's definitely important to look at um     
53:54     
it is um I I could think of some reasons why you know in terms of     
54:01     
mechanisms I think it is important because you know again     
54:06     
we've the situation that people are put in where they've they've got these these     
54:12     
feelings that they're hard to describe and so if somebody if somebody gets a     
54:17     
label then it's nice to know that you've got a label too right um the the one     
54:23     
thing I wanted to say was just an analysis that we did a long time ago which was contagion among psychiatrists     
54:31     
in terms of prescriptions and you know and and that     
54:37     
it seemed you know it's something you can do from open prescription Ben gold acr's website um and it's it just     
54:46     
relates to the fact that you know because because drugs are trial and error that you have doctors that have     
54:52     
particular prescribing you know um goto and you know they of course pass     
54:59     
those on to their to their students or mentees and you know it it's um it like     
55:08     
in um like in uh James glazers work you know like     
55:13     
computational epidemiology is actually widely applicable in all sorts of other domains yeah yeah that that that is that     
55:22     
is also of Interest yeah that that that uh that that kind of yeah contagion     
55:28     
model is is really like com after Brad Brad you oh I was you     
55:38     
know gonna say that's sounds like cultural Evolution where you have like     
55:43     
train like a mentor and then a trainee sort of copying the uh practices of the     
55:49     
mentor and that kind of perpetuates itself yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure for     
55:55     
sure well I wanted to say that I     
56:02     
notic also     
56:08     
ter and that so it's because the hypothesis     
56:16     
is that we resonate you know like when I come to I     
56:29     
[Music] first and I think it's very likely that     
56:36     
people interacting with with certain uh     
56:42     
States automatically like there's some     
56:49     
[Music] for therefore yes it is     
56:57     
but it can also be posi L I think like     
57:02     
create     
57:13     
virtu and about the fact that dementia ised as hypothesis I have spend time     
57:36     
had yeah yeah that sounds good     
57:41     
uh so any other comments before we go um just just my my chat thing like I     
57:51     
I think there's something what I don't really want to get into it now I think we'll you know kind wrap up right now     
57:57     
but if you could post what what Morgan was talking about some of the computational epidemiology stuff and how     
58:04     
it translates to other fields I think that might tie in something I said earlier so I want to look in that a bit more talk about it on slide because     
58:14     
there's it's tying a little bit into well and something I said earlier I don't want I don't want to get do it     
58:20     
again um but but yeah thank you for that and     
58:26     
yeah s Santa Fe Institute did something on that too     
58:34     
okay all right well yeah thanks for attending uh I think we'll wrap it up     
58:39     
here for today and uh you know yeah have a good week take care feel better all     
58:46     
right than bye thank you bye thank you bye

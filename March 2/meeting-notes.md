## NOTES
Ajad Ishmail: GSoC-curious. Congrats to us for finishing the BoC paper.

* cross-over between two groups (GFRG, CybRG). Work on DSM project -- do some things here.

* restoke the internship fire. Adverts for positions, etc.

* unique things we can do. EI conference (diverse intelligences, languages). Submit to DISI.

* Neuromatch --> NeuroAI course (advanced).


JoPro meeting -- manifestos, organizational issues. what working groups will look like?

* foundational research -- interdisciplinary (foresight-like). SEMF.


This week: COSYNE. #neuroscience-networks

* Making Modern Science book (Peter Bowler) -- historical computational -- fluid dynamics linkage.

* Neuromatch networking event. Neuro-, Climatematch. 

Nick Halper -- Neuromatch CEO, NeuroTechX, NASA (transition to open science).

* #open-science channel. Governing dynamics of clouds, ideal gas laws on a sphere. Multiscale phenomenon.


Proposals: scope, timeline.

* showcase your thinking. Lot of focus on developing researchers (developer, professional advice).

* topics (demo or die, getting/receiving feedback).


Crafter --> Mindcraft -- more efficient.

* Reinforcement Learning with World Models. "Mood" of the conference (cybernetical flavor).


In what ways can we summarize -- gain information.

* Ken Stanley -- left Open AI. Maven social network. Based on serendipity (Greatness Cannot be Planned book). 

* ML Street Talk podcast. Follow Topics, not Personalities.

* arXiv sanity preserver. ACT-R, bringing them into Network Brain Modeling and ML modules.


Architectural approaches to meta-cognition.

* meta-cognition is an exciting approach. Neurosymbolic.

* Meta-brains and AI debate focus. Hybrid Models. 

* Leabra, Randall O'Reilly. 


dBV approach -- Meta-Brain components. Meta-cognition model.

* EI Workshop approach. Meghan Peters (Philosophy, meta-cognition).

* confidence in beliefs, other foundational aspects.

* where does meta-cognition come from?

* paradoxes, what do I think that I think? Epistemic barrier (see BoC).

* Philosophocal Notions fo the Self. Fine line, Adam Saffron inspired.


Saffron -- body, maps, and dissociative disorders. Embodied models.



Simple closed loop of neurofeedback -- needs to be discussed more. Random Matrix Theory.

* ethical AI-assisted closed lopp stimulation.

* XAI/discussion-based paper, outline.

* Doc needs to be updates. Neuroethics Hackathon and closed-loop stimulation. #society-ethics-tech channel.

* hardware data, explanability.

* AI ethics journal as target, Cybernetics journal.

Jes (OREL) says:
snippets of updates for me: lots of work on JOPRO administratively, and, there's mentoring work in development also ; I'm appreciating the break from Cognition Futures as I finish up the term and make other changes ; The inclusive gaming conference has yielded a lot of positive contacts, plot twisters is still on break but looks to do more later this summer. Also I had a NYCWiC 2025 first meeting for that conference this week and it's exciting to see new volunteers and ideas come into play. 
Jes (OREL) says:
whose notion? 
Jes (OREL) says:
ok

I'd like to see more examples of using discord 
Jes (OREL) says:
that link in the slack 
Jes (OREL) says:
unforunately doesn't work any more 
Jes (OREL) says:
if you can find another updated one

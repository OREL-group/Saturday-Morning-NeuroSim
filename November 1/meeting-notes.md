[Bell Labs as an Innovation Powerhouse](https://youtu.be/-877yF9H70M)

[Sarrah Bastawala discusses the GSoC Mentor's Summit](https://youtu.be/Yhpcb_1ALGs)

## NOTES
NetLogo --> doesn't need to be accurate, but scenario-building.

* find the right computational representation.

* we are more theoretical than CHAOSS (management tool, not understanding). 

* what are the goal of open-source sustainability.


Technical Achievements --> LLMs, RLs, ActInfs.

* cursor 2.0 -- team focused on LLM models.

* Asimov Press backstory -- Astera Foundation, ARC institute, Future House (https://www.futurehouse.org/).

* focused research organizations. 


Host the next phase of this discussion (Ken Liu and others). 

* AugLab summit -- what is the curriculum that should exist -- know that your work will contribute.

* Knowledge Generation does not equal Science. Dan van Zant.

* Asimov Press -- started with biology training, JSchool writing skill. PIs can craft a great story.


Future Science: just making papers vs. creating other artifacts.

* AI can help innovation (if the problem is volume).

* systemic awareness when we are training people.

* illiteracy RE: domain of knowledge. Trained generations of people to "not get it".

* fast changes not incorporated.


mershin --> label-free research group @ MIT. ekkolapto computational group.

* person moving in from Substack --> intentionally creating communities around ideas.

* experiences acquired via residencies.

* "Bell Systems Engineer" -- category and mindset.

* Systems Engineer: serve as a connector, weak tie with different research group.


Deeply processing realities -- update on what different types of organizations can do.

* what domain spaces could a Bell Labs function in things that are fit to market vs. innovation and associate topics (start-up).

* needed curricula -- Cosmos Institute. Seminars, problem space (Create org, training people), sobriety of theoretical space and domain va. real-world relevance.


Legitimacy and Funding-producing places. 

* not taught in school, things that dominate careers.

* build a new Bell Labs, sense of it being underground (people need to build it).

* Sensorimotor AI club -- examples of addressing "real" problems (ekkolapto as well).

* literacy, Praxis, etc needed. Bell Labs don't fall out of the sky.

* empowering people to framing problem, common topics).


Mershin -- presented at a Hackathon (ID problems for ekkolapto). Molecular infomration.

* Sarrah presentation: 3-minute lightening talk -- unconference (problems, common topics.

* metrics --> vision around Agent-based Modeling. Cntributor retention or cost-work optimization.

* "good enough (better)" vs. "perfect" --> project velocity and health.

Jes (JOPRO) says:
also I can't find it but the person who recently left substack after founding it and why they made substack the way they did

Jes (JOPRO) says:
id like to send this article to someone i know who worked in Bell.

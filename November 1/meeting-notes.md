## NOTES
NetLogo --> doesn't need to be accurate, but scenario-building.

* find the right computational representation.

* we are more theoretical than CHAOSS (management tool, not understanding). 

* what are the goal of open-source sustainability.


Technical Achievements --> LLMs, RLs, ActInfs.

* cursor 2.0 -- team focused on LLM models.

* Asimov Press backstory -- Astera Foundation, ARC institute, Future House (https://www.futurehouse.org/).

* focused research organizations. 


Host the next phase of this discussion (Ken Liu and others). 

* AugLab summit -- what is the curriculum that should exist -- know that your work will contribute.

* Knowledge Generation does not equal Science. Dan van Zant.

* Asimov Press -- started with biology training, JSchool writing skill. PIs can craft a great story.


Future Science: just making papers vs. creating other artifacts.

* AI can help innovation (if the problem is volume).

* systemic awareness when we are training people.

* illiteracy RE: domain of knowledge. Trained generations of people to "not get it".

* fast changes not incorporated.


mershin --> label-free research group @ MIT. ekkolapto computational group.

* person moving in from Substack --> intentionally creating communities around ideas.

* experiences acquired via residencies.

* "Bell Systems Engineer" -- category and mindset.

* Systems Engineer: serve as a connector, weak tie with different research group.


Deeply processing realities -- update on what different types of organizations can do.

* what domain spaces could a Bell Labs function in things that are fit to market vs. innovation and associate topics (start-up).

* needed curricula -- Cosmos Institute. Seminars, problem space (Create org, training people), sobriety of theoretical space and domain va. real-world relevance.


Legitimacy and Funding-producing places. 

* not taught in school, things that dominate careers.

* build a new Bell Labs, sense of it being underground (people need to build it).

* Sensorimotor AI club -- examples of addressing "real" problems (ekkolapto as well).

* literacy, Praxis, etc needed. Bell Labs don't fall out of the sky.

* empowering people to framing problem, common topics).


Mershin -- presented at a Hackathon (ID problems for ekkolapto). Molecular infomration.

* Sarrah presentation: 3-minute lightening talk -- unconference (problems, common topics.

* metrics --> vision around Agent-based Modeling. Cntributor retention or cost-work optimization.

* "good enough (better)" vs. "perfect" --> project velocity and health.

## TRANSCRIPT
0:01   
Hello. Morning. How are you?   
0:09   
All right. Few minutes to get going here. All right. Got to get the dogs out.   
0:15   
All right. Hello. Bey.   
0:24   
Hi. How are you? All right. Good. Hi.   
0:33   
So, uh, did you have any updates you'd like to share with us or?   
0:40   
Um, no, nothing really. So, today we had college and we held a ML marathon for   
0:47   
our juniors. That's it. Yeah. Okay. And yeah, apart from that, I I texted you about uh the Microsoft research   
0:54   
internship. So, I'm just going to apply and   
1:00   
I think that's it. Okay. Well, that's good. Yeah. Go ahead   
1:06   
and apply and I'll be happy to write your letter when they request it. Yeah. Okay.   
1:11   
Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. And it looks like Sarah will be joining us. Um Yeah.   
1:21   
Yeah. I spoke to her last week, I think, about uh like she had gone to Germany, right?   
1:28   
Yeah. Yeah. For the mentor summit. Yeah.   
1:33   
Hello Jesse. Also, oh go ahead.   
1:39   
Yeah. Sorry. I was just going through like I like remember I asked you about the like how I can continue working in   
1:46   
oral. So I haven't yet completely had a look at what you said like you sent me a link about representational brains and   
1:54   
uh phenotypes, right? So I'm still having a look at it. Yeah. Okay. Do you mind if I add like uh about oral   
2:02   
in my resume? Like I've already mentioned GOC in my resume but apart from that if I separately add about the   
2:10   
lab, is it fine? Yeah, it's good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.   
2:15   
Yeah. It's usually you know if you have experience at the lab, you know, I mean it's kind of beyond GOC now. So yeah,   
2:24   
it'll be fine. Okay. Okay.   
2:30   
Good. Hello, Jesse. How are you?   
2:46   
All right. Uh, so yeah, I guess Sara contacted Okay, Sara, I guess. in the   
2:55   
Slack that she would be wanting to present today. I don't know. She's   
3:00   
probably getting online. So, we'll we'll try to do that. Um and then I have some   
3:06   
things I want to talk about. Um you know, and then of course we'll have our usual discussions,   
3:12   
but I wanted to kind of go over this week or what we've been doing   
3:17   
recently. So uh this week of course we had the diva war meeting and that was um   
3:26   
Leilith gave a present he was one of our GC scholars he gave a presentation on   
3:32   
his spatio temporal lineage idea which he's now turning into a paper. So one   
3:37   
going over like a lot of the technical details of what that's going to look like.   
3:43   
We also talked about uh pseudo embryos and how people are taking gastroloids   
3:49   
and building mono embryos or models of embryos out of them. of being able to   
3:55   
replicate spatial restriction and other gene expression patterns of   
4:01   
mamalian embryos in gastroloids is interesting work   
4:06   
and you know that's uh something we covered and uh then de or then uh for   
4:11   
the active inference institute symposium is coming up in I think two weeks it's   
4:17   
the 13th through the 16th or something like that so that's something that you   
4:22   
know you want to sign up for and I have put a sign up link in the general   
4:28   
channel for people to sign up at um you know if you want to attend the zoom   
4:34   
session that they have you need to sign up otherwise there is probably going to   
4:39   
be a live YouTube stream so you can watch it there too but you know you   
4:45   
might want to join the zoom channel okay um so we've had number number of   
4:53   
interesting things pop up in the Slack. The first thing is this um article that   
4:58   
Hussein posted in the Slack. So this is um it's I guess some sort of Substack   
5:04   
article by Eric Gileiam and this is on engineering innovation.   
5:11   
How did places like Bell Labs know how to ask the right questions? And an alternate form of this title is   
5:18   
why all applied research organization should hire a Bell style systems engineer. So if you recall your history,   
5:26   
Bell Labs was set up as part of the United States Bell service which was the phone monopoly that existed in the early   
5:35   
to mid to late 20th century. And so   
5:41   
there were a lot of people who worked there who turned out a lot of prolific work. Uh chief among them being Claude   
5:49   
Shannon who developed information theory, developed a number of uh of   
5:54   
animallike robots and did juggling and study juggling   
6:00   
you know and things like that. So he was very prolific. But the whole environment there was really a place where a company   
6:08   
had a lot of money and they had a lab and they would fund the lab um and and   
6:14   
they'd be very generous with their funding and then the people who they hired would do the sit there and think   
6:19   
about problems and come up with you know write papers and and and develop applications.   
6:25   
So it was you know they didn't really have to go for their own funding. they just had their, you know, everything funded and they were able to get their   
6:33   
work accomplished unimpeded. So you know but what this is saying is   
6:40   
that there's this set of skills that you know a bell style systems engineer that   
6:46   
kind of magically appear in people which you know I guess right away from the   
6:51   
title my skepticism is that if you don't have the environment how do you have the   
6:56   
Bell style systems engineer because as you know Bell Labs is no more and we   
7:02   
haven't really had a a true replacement for Bell Labs. We have we have other corporate labs where people do   
7:09   
information uh research and other things like that but we don't really have a bell labs anymore. So it doesn't   
7:16   
necessarily make sense to say a bell style systems engineer when maybe what you really mean is an interdisciplinary   
7:23   
systems engineer or something like that. And then the question is where would they come from? um do we need that   
7:29   
environment to replicate that type of person or can we get that from just   
7:36   
people you know going to interdisciplinary programs and coming   
7:42   
from other places and then you know putting themselves out on the market. So   
7:47   
that's that's kind of where this article is coming from. So um it starts off many   
7:53   
new science orgs are looking to pursue research that has the positive aspects of both applied research and basic   
7:59   
research. So this is kind of the distinction that a lot of uh research   
8:05   
units make. They're either doing applied research or basic research and you know   
8:11   
balancing both of them is sort of important for this kind of style of   
8:16   
systems engineer. Uh it's something that Claude Shannon did quite well. But again, you know, this is something that   
8:22   
in in the modern era is kind of lost because people are kind of the culture of the modern day world is, you know,   
8:30   
choosing one or the other. To me, this is a very reasonable approach. After all, the applied versus   
8:37   
basic research distinction has always been a rather arbitrary one. And again, yeah, it's arbitrary because usually,   
8:43   
you know, if you're an engineer especially, you're kind of doing a lot of applications,   
8:49   
but oftentimes you have to engage in basic research and and they don't really call it that necessarily, but you do   
8:55   
that. And every engineering paper, you usually have like a section where you have to derive a proof or put some   
9:01   
equations down to state your assumptions and things like that. So, that's pure research or basic research in a sense.   
9:09   
Uh, you know, if you're doing bioengineering, you might have to do a lot of basic research to get to the   
9:14   
point where you can build an engineered um, you know, an applied thing, an   
9:21   
applied artifact. Some research projects feel like they're   
9:27   
squarely in one bucket or another, but it's not always that clear. Applied research is meant to be research with   
9:33   
immediate applications in mind. But of course, applied research could stumble upon something that leads to a   
9:39   
fundamental insight. Basic research is meant to be curiositydriven research without immediate applications   
9:46   
in mind, which is a decent definition. I would add that basic research is about   
9:53   
things that don't, you know, are agnostic to application. So basic research isn't, you know, it's it's   
9:59   
driven by curiosity in the sense that you have to kind of come up with a question and test that idea as opposed   
10:05   
to having something there as a it's kind of like a toolbox or a package and then applying it to a problem. It's just a   
10:12   
different mindset. Um, and you know, it's it's it's actually necessary for   
10:18   
the killer applications, but it's not part of the same research   
10:23   
pipeline. uh but of course it could quickly lead to a killer application. In   
10:28   
the universe of possible courses of research there exists many questions that in the end will satisfy the spirit   
10:34   
of both applied and basic research. The natural follow-up question is, is   
10:40   
finding the subset of golden problems really feasible? Which is kind of um you know, if you   
10:46   
could find research problems that involved both basic and applied domains,   
10:52   
you know, could you find those problems? I mean, you can find, you know, pure   
10:58   
research problems that are interesting and that have, you know, that are give a good result, but they're not very   
11:04   
interesting from a an applied standpoint because you can't really apply it to any kind of technology, at least one that   
11:10   
exists today. And so, and the same thing holds true for applications. Sometimes applications   
11:17   
are trivial to someone who wants to uh you know is more interested in knowledge   
11:23   
production and things like that and only there's this maybe this small area of   
11:29   
problems that kind of cover both. And so you know the idea is that if you want someone who's both good at basic problem   
11:36   
solving and applied problem solving they have to kind of engage with these problems to get gain that skill set.   
11:44   
One's knee-jerk reaction might be that it is not not replicable in any kind of systematic way. It is a matter of   
11:51   
unreliable personal taste. The history tells a different story. The mid 20th   
11:56   
century's uh great American R&D lab show us that selecting profitable uh courses   
12:01   
of research that satisfy the spirit of basic research has been done at a high level with large re research   
12:08   
organizations over the course of several decades. And so in this piece he dives into Bell Labs, how Bell Labs ensure   
12:15   
that their researchers are working on the right problems. And so this is part of a series examining uh where modern   
12:23   
applied research labs can learn from the great dragons of industrial research and development places like Bell Labs, G   
12:30   
research and DuPont research develop uh and development. So this is you know these I I don't know   
12:36   
if DuPont lab still exists. uh I don't know G I don't think G research labs   
12:42   
exists in the same form but the you know the culture that they had at that time   
12:48   
is what he's interested in. So um these institutions were you know storied at   
12:54   
the time they had Nobel Prize winners in their in their research directory um and   
13:01   
they were also profitable entities so they were able to take their innovations and sell them on the market. So you had   
13:07   
these applications that could be sold for profit, but you also had these basic   
13:13   
research questions that were being answered that then fed into that pipeline to produce more uh applied   
13:18   
research that could be uh marketed. And so that's kind of the idea. Um they had   
13:26   
their differences, but they all stumbled upon many aspects of managing their research operations that were rather   
13:31   
similar. The managers of these organizations and other researchers at the time often felt the management   
13:37   
decisions they made were common sense rather than some great discovery.   
13:43   
Uh however, these common sense decisions are things we often don't do today but almost certainly should.   
13:50   
Okay. Um so continuing Bell Labs has become   
13:55   
legendary in many tech circles. There's no secret why um famous ideas like   
14:01   
information theory, communication, satellites, solar batteries, transistors, and countless other   
14:07   
communications related innovations trace their origins back to Bell Labs in one way or another. Idolizing Bell Labs for   
14:14   
its outcomes is very fair because its outcomes are extraordinary.   
14:21   
In recent years, many have begun to idolize Bell Labs for its processes, and there's nothing conceptually wrong with   
14:27   
that. If a place has consistently fantastic outcomes and seems to have some secret sauce that is super additive   
14:35   
to the productivity of its researchers, why would we not seek to replicate it? I   
14:40   
find this uh paragraph interesting. Uh you know, we think about like how   
14:45   
innovation proceeds and how to model, you know, innovation. this might be kind   
14:51   
of a key to to doing that. So, thinking about Bell Labs for a minute. Um, if you   
14:56   
can think about the process by which people do their research in Bell Labs, if you can break that down into like a   
15:02   
workflow or a set of workflows, uh, it'd be very I don't know if anyone's done that like in a formal way,   
15:09   
but that would be kind of interesting to do. and then have um this sort of uh how   
15:16   
do you get uh what they call he calls super additive productivity. So that   
15:22   
means that you have productivity that where if you combine different steps or   
15:27   
different things that you do in your research process that you get greater than an additive outcome basically some   
15:34   
sort of multiplicative or emergent outcome of that process. So if I do some   
15:40   
basic research and then the same team is doing the applied research, they have   
15:45   
some advantage of you know intellectual advantage over a team that would just take the basic research out of the   
15:51   
literature, pluck it out and apply something uh to   
15:56   
uh you know try to create an application from a set of findings. So that's kind   
16:01   
of where uh it would be interesting to see if we could model that in some way   
16:07   
and and and get interesting insights out of it. Um the issue is is that many who idolize   
16:14   
Bell's processes seem to fundamentally misunderstand how the operation worked.   
16:19   
The most notable misconception is that many put Bell forward as a poster child of how idle curiosity and that purist   
16:26   
kind of basic research can have a role in industry. looking at the historical sources,   
16:33   
that's not exactly an accurate takeaway. So, Bell did a lot of astonishing basic   
16:38   
research, but its research, while basic for an applied R&D lab, was not nearly   
16:44   
as free as many imagine, or rather it was embodied in a different kind of freedom. Equating the freedom of   
16:51   
a fine hall mathematician at the Princeton Institute of Advanced Study and a physicist at Bell Labs in in the   
16:57   
1950s is not really an accurate way of looking at it. So Bell was an industrial   
17:04   
R&D lab. To an industrial R&D lab, the mission is everything. Frank Jwitt, the   
17:10   
founding director of Bell Labs once said that his new industrial R&D lab was to be and this is a quote an instrument   
17:17   
capable of avoiding many of the mistakes of a blind cut and try experimentation.   
17:22   
So this is where you know in a lot of pure research we will kind of think   
17:28   
about a problem and then try to um fashion an set of experiments to test   
17:35   
their idea. And so, you know, this is kind of the way we usually do things and   
17:41   
we just kind of figure out what works and what doesn't and then get to um you   
17:46   
know, some experimental design that kind of shows how this works. It shows the   
17:51   
the sort of the effect. Uh it is likewise an instrument which   
17:57   
can bring to bear an aggregate uh or creative force of any particular problem which is infinitely greater than any   
18:03   
other uh greater than any force which can be conceived of as residing in the   
18:08   
intellectual capacity of an individual. Okay. So the focus on applications   
18:14   
leading the research is not the one not one that faded over the course of Bell's lab's lifetime. John Pierce, his 35-y   
18:21   
year career. He was there from 1936 to 1971. Uh   
18:29   
he was there for most of the existence of Bell Labs said this of what made Bell Labs a success. This is again a quote.   
18:37   
Someone depended on them for something and was anxious to get it. They were really needed and they rose to the need.   
18:44   
So this is kind of where you you had entities you had you know people who had   
18:51   
an interest in solving a problem and they came to Bell Labs to solve that problem and then there was an interest   
18:57   
in you know uh taking that application and making it successful.   
19:04   
People who see Bell Labs as a bastion of freedom in private sector research are entirely mistaken. Bell was a pretty   
19:10   
damn pretty damn free for a private sector lab. It's just that it was a balancing act. Uh so in the Bell Labs   
19:18   
there were these young Turks which are usually people who want to change things younger people. And this is Jim Fisk. Uh   
19:25   
so Jim Fisk along with Pierce, this is John Pierce, uh who helped shepherd it   
19:31   
in its famous balance of deep research with careful problem selection said the following of Bell's philosophy and   
19:38   
problem selection when he managed Bell Labs or when he was managing it. Uh so this is another quote. Our fundamental   
19:45   
belief is that there is no difference between good science and good science relative to our business. So you know   
19:51   
you you have good science practices. You make it relative to your business but you don't compromise that um you know   
19:59   
it's good science is good science. Among a thousand scientific problems a   
20:04   
hundred or so will be interesting but only one or two will be truly rewarding both to the world of science and us.   
20:12   
What we try to provide is the atmosphere that will make selecting the one or two in a thousand a matter of individual   
20:18   
responsibility and essentially automatic. So this is kind of problem selection and you know this is true I   
20:26   
think of any lab where you have to kind of have this process of problem selection where you say okay um there   
20:33   
you know we could solve any problem we want. We could design any experiment we want within reason you know based on   
20:38   
what we can measure and things like that. uh what would be the most uh salient to the kind of question we want   
20:45   
to ask. So this is kind of you know already something people do   
20:52   
um you know they but they really kind of have to think about uh deeply about this problem selection   
20:58   
step and how it it serves applications.   
21:03   
Uh now this is not Fisk saying that the only relevant problems in electrical communication were those that serve   
21:09   
Belle's business interests but it was him saying that the following many scientific problems are kind of a bore   
21:16   
derivative. He bulparked it arbitrarily at 90%. So for an applied research lab   
21:23   
you're not trying to answer questions that don't lead to applications. you're not trying to answer questions that are   
21:29   
really kind of hard to get your hands around and those are not what in their   
21:35   
purview and so um you also don't want to answer questions that are sort of   
21:41   
already been as answered. Um some minority of problems are interesting. He   
21:46   
ballparked that arbitrarily at 10%. So that's interesting to that group of people. Um but there yeah when you're in   
21:53   
a when you have such a strong sort of definition of what your you know institution does um then of course you   
22:03   
can um you know have this kind of um you   
22:08   
know frame where you say okay these problems are interesting it's a small number of problems and then these other   
22:14   
problems are kind of what we don't want to do. So we can have this sort of problem selection at a pretty high   
22:20   
level. and then one of 1% or 2% of the interesting problems that is 0.1% or 2%   
22:27   
of total problems because remember our interesting problems are 10% of all problems   
22:34   
would turn out to be worthwhile and relevant to Belle's work. So a lot of problem selection and a   
22:42   
strong criterion for it. This picture uh this paints Belle's   
22:48   
preferences for basic research is twofold. The picture this paints of Bell's   
22:54   
preferences for its basic researchers is twofold. So this is kind of you know   
22:59   
what we want researchers to be doing with their time. The first point is that the universe of possible problems is   
23:06   
very large. Belle would like it more fundamental researchers feel free to work on   
23:11   
interesting ones. So they want people to just sort of directly engage in the most interesting stuff that's interesting to   
23:18   
the mission of Bell Labs as defined in this strong definition.   
23:23   
So you know we don't want them to work on something that's totally offthe-wall will never lead to any success or a   
23:30   
success in building an application. And then two among the interesting problems, Bell Lab's management would   
23:37   
implement systems to make sure researchers identify problems that had a high probability of turning into   
23:44   
profitable answers for the Bell telephone system. So this is again, you know, having this strong definition of   
23:51   
what we actually want to do. And so you could do this with an applied lab or in   
23:56   
a lab with an applied component. But if you're just in a lab where you're not doing any sort of applied work, it's a   
24:04   
little harder to do. I guess you could say scient replace that with scientific impact. But you know, that's again hard   
24:11   
to know in the same way that you know what's profitable, right? Like you know   
24:16   
for Bell Telephone, they know kind of what is profitable and what isn't.   
24:21   
That's a, you know, kind of a separate issue, but it's also not because, you   
24:26   
know, you kind of know if something is going to be able if you can maybe build something that turns a profit versus   
24:33   
some or fit into the existing profitable operations as opposed to something that   
24:38   
you would have to wait 20 years to turn a profit on or never turn a profit. And you know, with scientific uh impact, you   
24:46   
kind of know if you can aim for a nature paper, that's scientific impact. But there are a lot of papers that have   
24:52   
scientific impact that aren't nature papers necessarily. So it's a little harder to do in a setting like that.   
25:01   
Over the years, Bell Lab man Bell Lab's management developed a small but coherent set of constraints and rules of   
25:07   
thumb to ensure that its researchers internalized that as Jim Fisk put it, it   
25:12   
was a matter of individual responsibility to choose the right problem and that Bell's lab success was   
25:18   
in doing this at scale across thousands of individuals and that this process be   
25:24   
essentially automatic. So it's like people were trained to kind of think in that mindset of identifying problems in   
25:31   
this way and satisfying this criterion. It wasn't something that managers did or   
25:36   
enforced. It was something individuals did and enforced. It kind of reminds me of kind of how you think about open   
25:43   
source projects where you know you don't have strong managers,   
25:48   
you have maybe project leaders, but you also have people who engage in projects who have to sort of identify what the   
25:55   
useful um contributions to a project are. So sometimes you know if you have   
26:02   
people fixing bugs or adding features those are useful things. Sometimes you   
26:09   
can you know build the the framework for something and that's good but it's a   
26:14   
different set of kind of you know it's a different set of contributions. So you know in open source uh projects   
26:21   
we see this kind of ethos to some extent. Um and you know sometimes it is   
26:26   
limiting though because if you don't have a strong institution behind you um   
26:32   
you know that maybe you don't get the same result. Okay. Okay. So, Bell Labs research   
26:38   
problem selection rules of thumb systems and constraints. So, the majority of Bell Labs is made up of applied   
26:44   
researchers, development, development engineers and other staff, not basic   
26:49   
researchers per se. So, the researchers, you know, they didn't have the sort of   
26:55   
interests that basic researchers had. They had the interests of applied researchers and engineers and then they   
27:02   
just kind of did that some of the basic research that they could do. So it kind of shapes this problem selection because   
27:10   
a lot of really basic problems aren't very interesting to them by default because that's not what they uh are uh   
27:17   
socialized or inculturated to be interested in. And these groups usually have a normal   
27:24   
um set of projects assigned to them. Uh while Bell's Bell's basic researchers   
27:29   
did not. So um you know you had a difference Belle's basic researchers and   
27:37   
their applied researchers. So, uh, Bell had a different organization   
27:43   
for basic research and then Bell Labs did a lot of this basic to uh, applied   
27:51   
translation. Nevertheless, even though the basic researchers did not have bosses in the   
27:56   
traditional sense, they were still nudged about relevant problems in various ways. And so these three ways,   
28:04   
these three types of nudges uh were granting researchers what I would call a long leash but a narrow fence in which   
28:11   
to conduct their explorations. So you could explore things but then there's a fence to what you could uh where you   
28:18   
could go with that. Number two, facilitating very regular interactions between basic researchers   
28:25   
and Bell's fundamental development researchers, engineers, manufacturing facilities, and implementation staff.   
28:31   
So, everyone interacted knew kind of what their uh point of view was on   
28:36   
things. To top it off, Bell had a core of what they called systems engineers   
28:42   
who ensured that the integration of its best researchers and most pressing problems was not left a chance. So the   
28:48   
systems engineers tied everything together. Okay. So that was kind of the idea. So you had these I would you know   
28:56   
I guess they're interdisciplinary groups in the sense that you have people from different backgrounds talking to one   
29:02   
another. you had this sort of long leash narrow fence which is basically where we   
29:08   
enforce kind of what you work on but not in a top down way but just kind of like   
29:13   
you know um is this good for the lab basically. Um, and so those are, you   
29:19   
know, that's kind of the way they kind of approach this. And then of course they had these uh   
29:27   
sort of uh I don't know what I call them weak ties, but basically   
29:32   
uh people who linked two different networks together. So you had networks   
29:38   
of engineers, networks of manufacturing managers, networks of development   
29:43   
researchers, and they were all tied together by systems engineers who could translate between those groups. But   
29:50   
those groups also interacted on their own. So you didn't have the traditional silos   
29:56   
that you might get in an organization that segregates basic research from   
30:01   
applied research in you know in the conventional way that we know. Um so   
30:07   
yeah this is basically kind of going through some more personal interviews   
30:14   
and um you know kind of talking about um you know some of the ways in which   
30:20   
they think about freedom and uh you know their work and everything else. Um   
30:28   
yeah so this is interesting. Um Pierce uh who was giving this interview after   
30:33   
his retirement from Bell Labs while he was at Caltech then continues his reflection. So Pierce says too much   
30:40   
freedom is horrible. It's like telling a young child do whatever you want to do. You've heard this story. There are   
30:46   
various outcomes. One is do I have uh have to do what I want to? Complete   
30:51   
freedom is not very helpful to a person uh who's inexperienced in the world. It's certainly bad to be directed to do   
30:58   
things very very narrowly and with no freedom, but it's my guess that for every person who needs more freedom,   
31:05   
there are 10 people who need more help in finding their way. Um, and so that's kind of an interesting quote. Um   
31:14   
and so he basic study because he came to understand   
31:20   
exactly what development work was ongoing at Bell Labs, what it looked like for a basic researcher to do useful   
31:26   
work and then come up with a course of work to suit those needs. Um and then you know you of course you   
31:33   
had the frequent interactions of researchers, engineers, manufacturing   
31:39   
facilities and implementation staff. And that was key because it broke down these silos that you tend to get when people   
31:46   
work in their own teams and then maybe just pass off the work from one team to   
31:51   
another. So this is uh again Pierce gives some more oral history here uh   
31:57   
about how there was this constant back and forth between   
32:03   
different groups, different sets of expertise. Um, and then Bell systems, uh, Bell   
32:11   
systems engineers tied this whole process together. So, systems engineers as they were defined at Bell Labs were   
32:18   
about 10% of the total lab headcount. And they were usually technically trained individuals who spent all their   
32:24   
time on keeping one eye on the reservoir of new knowledge and another on the   
32:30   
existing phone system and analyzed how to integrate the two. In other words,   
32:36   
the systems engineers considered whether new applications were possible, plausible, necessary and economical. So   
32:43   
they you know kind of had responsibility for knowing kind of uh what was going on   
32:50   
in the field or what was going on in the scientific literature or engineering literature and then they also had to   
32:57   
keep their eye on the phone system as it existed. So any new innovations or any   
33:02   
changes in what was going new technologies they had to integrate those things. So they could say, well, there's   
33:08   
this new idea that's kind of up and coming in the literature and we have this need in the phone system. Let's   
33:15   
kind of match those two and bring them together.   
33:21   
Uh the existence of systems engineers was Bell acknowledging that a culture of openness and helpfulness was just not   
33:28   
sufficient when it came to finding the best problems. Uh, of course, implementation, manufacturing, applied   
33:34   
research staff often uh could identify which of their problems are ripe for the research   
33:40   
team's eyes, but a lot of times they can't. Sometimes researchers can come up with great research questions in their   
33:47   
area that are ripe for helping a specific group's work, but a lot of times they don't do a great job. And so   
33:54   
this is just kind of thinking about um basic researchers finding a good applied   
33:59   
problem but also finding one that makes the best use of their time. So this is a   
34:05   
twofold thing where you have good problem to work on where you can get an answer and and build something that's   
34:11   
profitable but then is this the best use of your time because there might be more than one problem like that. which is the   
34:18   
best one to work on and so can people reliably find these types of questions   
34:24   
and can they make that judgment as to what to pursue?   
34:30   
Okay. And so systems engineers are pretty successful at this. Um uh this is Mvin   
34:38   
Kelly who was a manager and he described the background of systems engineers in   
34:43   
the following way. uh systems engineers must supply a proper blending of competence and   
34:49   
background in each of the three areas that it contacts research and fundamental development   
34:56   
specific systems and facilities development and operations. It is therefore largely made up of men drawing   
35:03   
from these areas who have this is men in the time that we were talking about probably uh who exhibited unusual   
35:10   
talents and analysis in the objectivity so essential to their appraisal responsibility.   
35:16   
So there's a trade-off. Um, now instead of using a systems engineer skills for normal scientific   
35:23   
research or engineering tasks, these individuals were doing other kinds of work. That's not a small trade-off. At   
35:30   
points, Bell systems engineering team was about the same size or maybe larger than Belle's basic research group. So,   
35:37   
they were actually a little bit bigger than the basic research group. But in a large and complex organization like   
35:42   
Bell, this trade-off was worth it. The systems engineers made it their business   
35:48   
to be extremely aware of the happenings of the research portion of Bell Labs as well as the minutiae of the industrial   
35:54   
portion of the company as well. And so you needed to have a lot of details kind   
36:00   
of at the ready for this. Of course, no individual systems engineer could know   
36:05   
everything and everyone, but the department as a whole attempted to account for everything, ensuring   
36:11   
ensuring as little as possible fell through the cracks. So it as so in addition to bringing   
36:17   
problems to researchers, systems engineers also found ways to deploy researchers findings and ways that could   
36:24   
solve problems in the field or improve Belle's products and processes. So that   
36:30   
was their role and they had to have this sort of return on investment calculus   
36:35   
ready to go. Like they had to think about how could you evaluate an idea and   
36:41   
think about the return on investment. So if you put money into it, you put time into it. What's the outcome? Is it worth   
36:46   
it? And so this is just, you know, kind of building this skill. Um, and a lot of   
36:53   
times, um, you know, it was about, uh, you know, kind of acquiring the   
37:00   
skill in the organization, but sometimes it was just individual skill building as   
37:06   
well. And so I'm kind of skeptical that you could maybe have such a person or   
37:11   
find someone to hire like that today. You know, you may need to have them embedded in this culture of uh you know   
37:19   
how we build research, how we build and we have applied researchers and basic   
37:24   
researchers and we have people who can uh deal in different areas seamlessly   
37:30   
and you know where do you build those skills today? Well, it's hard to know because we don't really have an organization like Bell Labs right now.   
37:38   
So, uh this is and this just kind of talks about freedom and sort of how it   
37:43   
comes in many forms. And so the one outlier here perhaps is   
37:49   
Claude Shannon who um there are a lot of stories of Claude Shannon quote unquote   
37:55   
frittering away his time playing games in the Bell lunchroom.   
38:00   
These stories uh have become legendary.   
38:06   
Shannon would build things like chess machines, juggling and riding around on unicycles and pogo sticks. Um this was   
38:13   
not the norm, but this was something that he did. Um so there's a reason why   
38:19   
these became famous. It's because, you know, it was sort of an outlier in the labs, but also maybe it became a   
38:25   
shortorthhand for what went on at Bell Labs and it simply wasn't the the norm.   
38:30   
So um the bulk of the Shannon stories or at least the most frittery ones came   
38:36   
after he became a celebrity in the communications world was discovery or invention depending on your   
38:42   
philosophical view of mathematics of information theory. Uh on the heels of   
38:47   
that discovery instead of some big financial reward for Shannon Bel's management seems to have paid Shannon   
38:53   
with a kind of ameritus status in which they gave the genius the freedom to do whatever he wished. This came with the   
38:59   
freedom to do unique things like unicycle down hallways of work with the door to his office closed. So, it was   
39:06   
kind of like this special category they put Claude Shannon in and they, you   
39:11   
know, kind of allowed him to do this. Um,   
39:17   
but prior to his ameritus lifestyle, Shannon had lived a much more applied standard lifestyle in the lab where he   
39:24   
rope he was often roped into advising the applied folks and their issues and undertook more pressing concerns of   
39:30   
basic research. Um, different things having to do with the war effort in World War II, uh, other types of   
39:37   
mathematical problems.   
39:43   
Okay, so that was it. Um, so this is, you know, I think that's   
39:49   
probably enough for this article. Um, and they do make this contrast with the   
39:56   
university. So, you know, this is kind of in contrast to what happens at   
40:02   
universities. Um, university life surely had freedoms at Bell didn't, but most Bell researchers seem rather content   
40:09   
with the tradeoffs that they made. So they gave up some of the freedom that you would find in a university for some   
40:15   
of the aspects of um the Bell Labs culture. And it's interesting because a   
40:21   
lot of people maybe who didn't adapt well to Caltech, places like Caltech adapted well to the Bell Labs   
40:27   
environment. Okay. So I think that's all for that   
40:34   
article. It was a nice article. Thank you Hussein for posting it in the Slack.   
40:40   
Let's look at the chat here. Um, so, okay. Uh, Jess says that there there's   
40:47   
this um link here, merchant.org. Some other things to follow up about   
40:53   
this later. Okay, we'll we'll as an Azimov press article. We we'll follow up   
40:59   
on this later. Um, also, I can't find it, but the person who recently left Substack after founding it and why they   
41:06   
made Substack the way they did, this is an article. Yeah. So the first two were   
41:11   
just relevant things that basically came from this week and last week. Um Merion   
41:16   
was someone who did a label free like research group at MIT and like um and   
41:24   
then the last press person was something else. Um which I'll get to that later.   
41:29   
The Substack comment is the um I forget her name, but a few months ago   
41:37   
she basically said, "Oh, I'm leaving Substack finally," and it's a very tough decision because we built we built it a   
41:43   
certain way and and she's happy to move on and all this stuff, but it was basically about the designing process of   
41:48   
Substack. I think substack is basically what I'm the better venues now for certain kinds of um discussion   
41:56   
and I'm very curious how it came out to be built. Um   
42:03   
but yeah I I'd like to get this article and send it to someone I know who worked at Bell Labs and get their take on it.   
42:09   
So um you know hope I don't put the link somewhere please. I have I have a number   
42:16   
of takes on it and I don't know how much more time you want to spend on it because we have a lot going on here. I   
42:22   
know Sarah wants to present. So, um I guess I'll I'll quickly say um   
42:30   
it's really interesting because I didn't know that the systems I didn't know what a Bell systems engineer was until today.   
42:38   
Um and I wonder if that's what my friend technically was because they fit that description really well. And in a sense,   
42:46   
I think when I worked with them, they were kind of offering for me to be a version of that without me knowing it.   
42:54   
So, it's kind of like, wait a second, is this what you're trying to do? So, that's kind of interesting. Um, but more   
42:59   
more directly, um, I really I really wonder like like   
43:08   
it's very interesting to see what it was like back then. And also, there's sort of this   
43:13   
where where I'm coming from right now. Um, like which   
43:19   
I I might in the interest of time and other things   
43:24   
happening today or whatever. Um,   
43:29   
sorry my mic I seem to be having a lot of like I even hear my own self so I'm sorry my   
43:35   
mic's kind of weird. Um, but in the interest of of today, um,   
43:46   
I I will just say part of where I've been the last few weeks is deeply   
43:51   
processing some, you could say maybe realities,   
43:58   
uh, if you will, which is a little bit grave sounding, but like the article   
44:05   
seem to conclude, oh, that the freedoms of of academia and and all this other stuff. And I feel like   
44:12   
I think my stance on what different kinds of organizations   
44:18   
can do has kind of had a big update and and sort of the nature of where things   
44:24   
were. It's interesting to see like problem selection. It's interesting to see how do you design an organization to   
44:29   
target certain problems and and and I think that's fascinating but also like   
44:37   
You know, I think I really want and I don't know if this came from the article or not or in the discussion. I missed a little bit of discussion, but   
44:43   
essentially could a bell labs happen today at all and what would it look like? Um and and   
44:50   
what domain spaces would it function within? is interest like could you have   
44:56   
a could you have something where there's a a slight majority of systems engineers relative to whatever the specific domain   
45:03   
or application use systems versus supplied engineers whenever the domain is yeah you could   
45:09   
um like in at least in theoretical p like in theory you could set it up that way   
45:15   
um but like what you know what does that mean and what leeway and and how does   
45:23   
that relate to problems and how does that relate to like the political economic knowledge generation climate right now and those are those are   
45:30   
interesting things. So I I'll kind of leave it at that. Um I could I could   
45:37   
really go on for like probably an hour directly from that to other things but I know we might want to wrap that up and   
45:44   
I'm sure Sarah wants to say things and other folks might want to say things. So any anything else you want to say rarely   
45:49   
before? No, I I think some of the links you posted are pretty interesting. We'll have to look at the merchian one in a   
45:56   
little bit, but um yeah, I think uh you you said you well we had do have time.   
46:02   
You said you had some other thoughts on this. Um yeah. um without getting into the Merion   
46:09   
thing because he I got I saw I was he was I saw his pres I was at an event with him and he presented on what he did   
46:15   
the thing is for um that that was a talk through Echolapto   
46:23   
computational group whatever um and that was about   
46:29   
you know the there's a small community of people   
46:34   
trying to basically figure out how to to some new content research organizations.   
46:40   
Um, so this could potentially I might as the article and this discussion might be something I mentioned there basically.   
46:47   
Um, but beyond that, um, you know, and   
46:52   
and the substack thing, I think it's just very interesting to see a modern like subsect to me feels very   
47:00   
intentionally aware in terms of creating   
47:05   
a community around ideas and   
47:11   
I I'm I'm currently re we've talked about this before. I'm currently   
47:17   
I don't want to say fascinated. I'm very much interested in as you know I'm developing sort of Job Pro and this   
47:22   
futurist center thing and and with it is sort of this like okay what curriculums   
47:27   
are needed and and I think part of a curriculum that I think is is required   
47:33   
is essentially the topic we're talking about here like how do we do this? And I think,   
47:39   
you know, how do we do how do we make institutions or groups that focus on things that matter? And I was just I was   
47:46   
just reading by happen stance like, you know, um I I follow the Cosmos   
47:52   
Institute. We don't have to read this. We don't have to look at this, but like here this their recent take on like you   
47:57   
know something from one of their seminars about I don't know this is this is a feedback from their seminar about   
48:05   
um I don't know the stuff that they're doing and I'm in this I'm very deep in   
48:13   
this problem space of how are you creating an organization?   
48:21   
How are you training the people to participate in the organization or in   
48:27   
and I want when I say organization I just mean I don't know to do it like like it   
48:34   
doesn't have whatever form it is group of people research trying to do whatever the thing is but like the training of   
48:41   
the people the organizational structure and then the sort of sobriety   
48:47   
of   
48:53   
a theoretical problem space or domain versus the realities of the world that   
48:59   
we're in and what can be done in them. And I'm curious and I would ask this   
49:04   
sort of as you someone who probably knows a bit more about the article we just read and labs in general like   
49:12   
you know apparently system engineers are given a lot of leeway to explore or be a   
49:18   
breast the field and I assume that doesn't just mean like reading papers it   
49:23   
it's the you know feedback from the board like you said feedback from different like being actually in these   
49:29   
different spaces and kind of knowing okay this this group or this school of thought or this industry or this this   
49:36   
component of a particular whatever is going this direction and so I don't know   
49:42   
I find that to be like how do you   
49:50   
well first is there anything you want to say about those set of things before I I take another direction on it   
49:56   
no it's fine okay um I I just feel like I've   
50:06   
I've come to a new vantage point. Um   
50:15   
I think what one of the interesting things in in in the the the Cosmos   
50:22   
thing that I I saw I was just reading that prior to to this basically and I didn't read all of it and I don't think   
50:28   
it's like the greatest. I don't I don't want to go through the post at all. Honestly, I don't. But it it it offers a   
50:35   
nice sort of conjecture like what's science going to look like? Is it just in the future? Is it going to be like just a bunch of like, you know, labs all   
50:41   
over the world making all these papers? Which I kind of chuckled at the idea of the future is people making papers   
50:47   
because the future is not people making papers the way it has been. Like it doesn't even happen now. and and and and   
50:52   
there's so much like part of conversations I did earlier this week with with Esimov and everybody else like   
50:58   
making a paper is a wonderful thing to do but like making a paper 20 years ago   
51:04   
and 10 years ago versus now versus the future like did I post it in the Slack   
51:10   
or you post it but like like archives updating their paper policy like because   
51:15   
there's just so much geni papers and stuff now and it's just like the idea of   
51:21   
a paper itself. I think it's kind of a funny thing in the sense of it's it's   
51:26   
important but things are changing and and one of the things in the cosmos blink is basically like   
51:35   
AI can totally help science innovation if you think the problem is volume   
51:41   
because it can certainly enhance volume and speed of certain things but is that really the problem and I think I think   
51:48   
where I'm at right now is like My conviction has grown so much in the last   
51:53   
few years, particularly the last year or so about   
51:59   
the broad, you can phrase it positively or   
52:05   
negatively. A positive a negative way to say it might be a broad inability or   
52:11   
almost giving of a certain kind of systemic awareness. when we're training people at   
52:20   
very high to to to say a hot take sound bite.   
52:26   
Um I'm really convinced now that at very high levels um of institutions and   
52:33   
development and and both private and this is interesting both privately and   
52:38   
and and publicly or or whatever you want to say. Um   
52:44   
there's there's a a real um   
52:53   
limit placed on certain things and not even a sense of people trying to say   
52:58   
wave their fingers or be restrictive and red tape it but much more like I don't I don't know and I'd be really curious   
53:04   
because I don't know enough about about labs and systems engineers all this stuff but it sounds almost like 100% %   
53:13   
antiical to promoting system engineers as a predominant force in anything in the   
53:20   
sense of or at least in the sense of generalist or people like trying to do this like in most of my formal training   
53:26   
I've had zero contextualization um and in much of the like I'm talking   
53:31   
to many many young people now and and trying to deal with them as they're going through tech careers and like I said I'm doing stuff for like Nick Wick   
53:38   
and and and people coming up with their careers there and people in data science programs and people in the Boston   
53:45   
innovation community and and there s just a really strong um   
53:51   
you know sense of kind of inadequacy of the training like the training is very   
53:58   
limited and that's you know I'm not an undergraduate or graduate education or   
54:04   
formalized training is going to be only one thing and and its ability to update is only so much relative to vast   
54:11   
changes. But sure, but there's also just this   
54:16   
um I have a very strong sense that um   
54:24   
there's a kind of illiteracy around you could say future stuff, but I mean uh a   
54:31   
literacy about how their domain has come into being and   
54:37   
where their their particular domain is going. And and I I I I kind of just, you know,   
54:44   
you barely known me and Morgan's known me for a couple years now and and it's like what I'm saying sounds like what   
54:50   
I've said a few years ago, but it's a dramatically different feeling because not just, oh, we need to have frontier   
54:56   
maps or epistemology are cool or knowledge maps are really important. Now it's a sense of like no no no like I   
55:02   
think we've really trained generations of people to just not get it like like to not   
55:09   
they want to it's just the incentive structure and the training structure are   
55:15   
not there and so a lot of what goes through the startups and and it's kind   
55:21   
of like startups are supposed especially here in Boston like you have this startup community of you know   
55:27   
take your idea go to startup then you can refine your idea and it's like not really your your startup is fit to   
55:34   
market and if you have innovation relative to that it's usually innovation relative to   
55:40   
a market fit and there's very very very few you hear things like deep tech   
55:46   
strategy like there or like oh I'm going to make moonshots and it's like okay are   
55:51   
you really though and so there's this quite a bit of tension between how do you relate to fire an idea and   
56:00   
industry development and idea development and theory and are you changing the system and are you what is   
56:06   
your systemic buy in and like and now there's another layer of there's like the AI hype an AI bubble if you will of   
56:14   
just like what are you doing and I find there to be just a massive amount of um   
56:22   
it's almost like it's underground like I think I think that's to say another hot take in in this community, in the Boston   
56:29   
community, you you have your mainstream like you have mainstream, okay, I want to be tech, I want to go into biotech, I   
56:36   
want to go into health tech. Those things are very clear paths, but for people trying to do some of what we're   
56:41   
talking about or what we're kind of implying or getting at here. Um, it really feels underground in the sense   
56:48   
that some of it's highly popularized now with like big massive, oh, come join our   
56:53   
residency and and and and I've I've kind of had a mocking tone about residences   
56:59   
in some ways, but it's like I actually think well that's what what else you're going to do right now. Like if you're a young person trying to do these things,   
57:05   
you're not going to do it in most established places and you kind of have   
57:11   
to find your group of people and there's going to be weird funding things about it and weird communities and and and   
57:17   
that's just what it is. And maybe that's how it's always been, but it really feels like   
57:22   
for people trying to really pursue certain ideas, you have to kind of go even if it's like glitzy and wellunded.   
57:30   
Um there's a very particular arena that you're entering into with   
57:37   
trying to like understand and build and innovate things that are   
57:42   
adjacent to the legitimacy producing and the funding producing establishments.   
57:49   
And I'm I'm sure like you know I'm sure Morgan and Bradley could say like well there's I'm sure there's an element of   
57:55   
that's how it's always been. But I do think there's a contemporary   
58:00   
battleground right now or at least the contemporary view from what I'm   
58:05   
seeing myself and other people going coming up through things right now is like there's a very clear awareness that   
58:14   
for those who want to look at it you know a lot of people want to go through a data science program and just like   
58:19   
okay how do I do this I want I work for Amazon I want to increase performance and that's you know that's what it is   
58:25   
and fine but for people that are looking at like even data ethics or responsible   
58:30   
AI or you know trying to do more society ethics tech related things or frankly   
58:37   
who are just sort of a little bit more aware about the world and and sort of like the Kar and how empires of AI and   
58:44   
what's going on at open AI and like people who are kind of like trying to be savvy about what they're stepping into.   
58:51   
It's like well it's not really being taught in school. It's not   
58:57   
it there's a kind of a disincentive to knowing it but it also dominates careers   
59:03   
and so it's like what I find people to be quite a bit left you know left on their own about it and I' I've said that   
59:10   
many different times and many different forms but to kind of wrap up my   
59:17   
diet trap or whatever this is um I I think I think for people I I think   
59:26   
there's a very real sense of for people trying and they are they are there and   
59:32   
I'm very hopeful to see them aggregate in different spaces but for people that   
59:38   
are trying to build a new bell lab problems that matter. Um,   
59:45   
I really think there's a tremendous sense of it being   
59:51   
I think underground is a bit too strong. It's because of the old the old jam song. I did some punk rock thing for   
59:57   
Halloween, so it's in my head. But like underground isn't just like it isn't built yet and people are going   
1:00:04   
to have to build it and how do we do it? And I think there's a very sincere interest in in people who who do want to   
1:00:10   
do things that are I think it's I think business as usual and and sort of like education as usual if you will are   
1:00:18   
pretty um I don't even mean radically I'm not like   
1:00:25   
I don't see this as even a radical comment anymore which is sort of the thing but I think I think they're kind   
1:00:30   
of um noticeably lacking and and People are   
1:00:36   
trying to find okay how do I develop technology? How do I train myself? How do I understand the world? How do I try   
1:00:43   
to do or you know do real science or do real meaningful insight innovation? And   
1:00:49   
and I think you know we talked a few times ago I looked in the Slack about the the sensory motor uh   
1:00:58   
club and the debate structure of the city. Like that's great. this paper's um you know this article is very   
1:01:04   
interesting in terms of what was it like and I'm looking forward to follow up with my my Bell Labs   
1:01:11   
um former colleague person and and you know things we talk about here too like   
1:01:17   
I think I think these are I guess I'll conclude by saying I think these aren't   
1:01:25   
these aren't kind of like just nice things to think about anymore like I think these are actually the real   
1:01:30   
problems And I don't know who was really looking at them other than things that I'm trying to do and like kind of here and   
1:01:37   
things in JPro and then a little bit sort of echolopto adjacent community of   
1:01:42   
of people trying to look at it. It's like I think there's a very real question of what do how do we do this   
1:01:48   
kind of stuff and people are interested and they don't it's like it's like this sudden realization of okay it's 2025 we   
1:01:55   
don't really know how to do this like like we're all bumping up on people   
1:02:01   
people really people really want to know like I guess I guess I'll say that like people really want to know how to do   
1:02:07   
these kind of things and there and and across many fronts I'm realizing they   
1:02:13   
don't know And because like it's up to us to build it like whatever the mechanism and the literacy and kind of   
1:02:19   
the practice of doing the thing is going to be for us to build what the 2025 the   
1:02:26   
2025 you know the 203 2020 20s and the 2030s like what does this even try to   
1:02:31   
look like here like it doesn't really exist right now and people are kind of realizing we need to do some things   
1:02:37   
differently and um it's exciting but it's also my personal take on is   
1:02:43   
exciting, but it's also a realization that oh wow, like   
1:02:49   
there isn't there isn't like a secret Bell Labs hanging somewhere that's just going to enlighten everybody with their Bell Labs wisdom about it. You know what   
1:02:55   
I mean? Like it just doesn't I think that's the con the conviction for me now is like there is no one.   
1:03:01   
Um I don't like the phrase no one's coming to save you. uh but much more um   
1:03:09   
it will not be built until we choose to build it and and it it doesn't it hasn't been built. So   
1:03:15   
I I'll conclude with that. All right. Yeah, thanks Jesse. That's a great conversation to think about and   
1:03:23   
think, you know, kind of build off of later. Um but yeah, a lot of interesting   
1:03:29   
points about building institutions and how people are trained and how people access sort of this, you know, problem   
1:03:38   
finding and question building and things like that. Yeah. like framing the problem space   
1:03:46   
and then empowering people and making that relevant to our contemporary times   
1:03:52   
is going to be, you know, a lot of a lot more questions and answers than that   
1:03:57   
right now. But I do think people really I really I'm heartened because I think people really want to to to make some   
1:04:04   
things around that specifically. Yeah, like really quickly the the Mian   
1:04:13   
person he presented at a there was sort of a   
1:04:19   
hackathon type thing, biological hackathon um here in Boston and I was involved   
1:04:26   
with that a couple weeks ago and it's interesting because he he he basically was you know a proponent of   
1:04:34   
this label free group about um just trying to identify problems and and and   
1:04:41   
sort of coming up with the domain the names for them later and I don't know if you're familiar with with um Mian   
1:04:49   
Mian or not um but it's interesting guy um and I think he's going to try to do a   
1:04:56   
little bit of things with um some of the echolopt group too he's   
1:05:02   
he like I guess his book is like perceptual engineering whole faction on the senses. Like he's very interested in   
1:05:08   
like a lot of molecular um you know information stuff and you   
1:05:13   
know like not just dogs being able to interpret you know different things about people but you know um it's sort   
1:05:20   
of his his jam for that. So yeah, thank you.   
1:05:25   
All right. Uh looks like Sara's here and Sara contacted me and wanted to   
1:05:32   
present on some things that she you know she was at the uh Gox uh mentor summit   
1:05:39   
last week in Germany and so yeah   
1:05:46   
yeah congratulations on that looked kind of fun. So uh Sara is going to be   
1:05:51   
presenting in a minute here. So yeah, basically uh I got selected to attend   
1:05:56   
the mentor summit. basically uh why uh GOC was going on uh I uh there's like a   
1:06:04   
Google form that's floated uh as in like uh would you be interested to attend the summit and u I had filled that in uh of   
1:06:14   
course like for the summit there's like designated like maintainers and or admins usually for from each org are the   
1:06:21   
ones who are designated spots to uh attend. uh but then of course like if   
1:06:27   
some of them are not able to attend slots get freed up and that's when they take the people who expressed interest   
1:06:33   
to attend uh and like from a wait list and they take them. So I was selected as   
1:06:38   
that. So apart from me officially representing INCF there were two other people. So   
1:06:46   
uh there was the main uh so there was I was talking to Arab uh Arnam Banerjee   
1:06:51   
but Arnab was not able to attend. So uh there was Matthew Adams who   
1:06:57   
attended as the or admin uh and then there was another mentor named Dimitri   
1:07:03   
uh who also attended uh from who was also from another suborging.   
1:07:09   
Um and uh it was like it was from the 23rd to the 25th of October. Um it was   
1:07:15   
an amazing experience. Uh it was in Germany so I got to travel there as well   
1:07:22   
and um it was like the first day was basically a welcome dinner where we all   
1:07:27   
just got to meet each other. There were about I think 180 people attending uh   
1:07:32   
Google staff the mentors and everybody included and uh we all got to meet each other uh   
1:07:39   
you know interact about what our orgs did and all and it was just like a welcome dinner on the first day um and   
1:07:46   
then the second day is when it actually started. So throughout it was in this like unconference format in that like   
1:07:52   
Google prop kids where there were no like like there were very few one to   
1:07:58   
many sessions uh the most prominent of them uh were the lightning talks uh   
1:08:04   
which were held on the second day uh in two sessions. So that was very similar   
1:08:10   
to how we've also I've also given contributor lightning talks. a very similar format where each speaker gets   
1:08:16   
three minutes and they kind of uh give you like a   
1:08:21   
sneak peek into what their org does and what they did this year. And uh apart   
1:08:27   
from that um unless it was like some announcement uh everything was in an   
1:08:32   
unconference format where there weren't actually like one to many sessions but   
1:08:37   
they encouraged that anybody who wants to hold a session uh put it up on a board. They had a whole board with like   
1:08:44   
time slots and put it up on the board if it's you know if the slot is open and uh   
1:08:50   
like for a conference room. So there were about seven conference rooms where these sessions were going on simultaneously   
1:08:56   
and most of them were like discussions. So um like you know you get together in   
1:09:02   
a conference room that has a capacity of say 18 people, 20 people, 40 people at the max and all of you like sit around a   
1:09:10   
table and you put ahead what is your topic and everybody just discusses on it and the topics to that range from like   
1:09:17   
everything from um AI and how bad is it or how good is it to actual problems   
1:09:23   
that you know people are facing in their orgs to things that people wanted to share and you to talk to others about.   
1:09:30   
So I did two things regarding our org. One was I was trying to um give a   
1:09:37   
lightning talk. So there were registrations open for the lightning talk in advance but unfortunately there   
1:09:42   
was like a slight miscommunication uh with Matthew and I thought he was giving the talk and he thought I was   
1:09:48   
giving the talk for CF. So unfortunately we didn't get like a proper slot in so   
1:09:54   
the actual slots given by the GOC team filled up. uh but then there was another   
1:09:59   
time where the ballroom where the lightning talks were held were open. So a few of us who were on the wait list   
1:10:04   
and uh wanted to present uh presented then which was on Sunday I think. So   
1:10:10   
yeah I kind of had this like the first three slides from this presentation uh   
1:10:16   
which I presented as our lightning talk. uh one of which was this where I highlighted like everything that   
1:10:24   
uh we have done so far in like our open source community sustainability project from the pro like the three different   
1:10:32   
approaches done in 2022 with the published paper to my approach in 2024   
1:10:39   
um and then of course I wanted to focus on this year so I also presented Vidi's   
1:10:44   
project and how like uh she has incorporated everything from the past   
1:10:50   
few years and added her own uh metrics and her own new ideas into this project   
1:10:57   
and also her findings that she uh like she compiled in the preprint.   
1:11:05   
So all of this to like kind of give everybody an idea into what Orel does   
1:11:10   
and um yeah so this was a lighting talk. We also recorded it I think. Um if once   
1:11:15   
I get the video I'll try to put it up on the slack. Um so this was that and then another   
1:11:21   
major thing that uh I did was what I posted about. So I tried to hold a session on the uh opensource community   
1:11:28   
sustainability and kind of wanted to talk about the metrics um you know that like because that's   
1:11:35   
like one of the things that we face a lot as well where like I remember even in my year   
1:11:42   
that was a question I asked and even that was also a question that Vidi had asked me where like how do we like we're   
1:11:47   
making the simulation what are the metrics for this and there's been a lot of discussion about this and we've all   
1:11:53   
gone through like Bradley's bribe on like all the papers that have it but I also wanted to uh discuss with everybody   
1:12:01   
there because they are the people in those open source communities and uh the these are the people that you know have   
1:12:07   
been sustaining it quite some time. So I held this suggest uh held this session and even though it was a 9:00 a.m.   
1:12:14   
session in the morning like I held it in a capacity of 18 pe of a room with the capacity of 18 people and about 22   
1:12:21   
people showed up. So there are four people standing for like the duration of the 1 hour session but it was a very   
1:12:27   
like uh people were very excited to kind of talk about this topic and uh yeah so   
1:12:34   
like this page is like the notes that I taken through during the session but I was also trying to compile it because we   
1:12:40   
can also put it up on the official uh like the website uh the summit website.   
1:12:47   
So uh but yeah the some of the main things that we talked about there. So first I presented like what or has been   
1:12:53   
because by this at this point my lightning talk had not yet already been done. So uh to give like sort of some   
1:12:59   
context into what we actually do I kind of presented those similar slides   
1:13:05   
um and what was the reason that I was you know wanted to discuss this um and   
1:13:10   
then we had like some discussions. So the main two questions that I posed to the group was uh the first was what is   
1:13:16   
the core definition of sustainability and like you know how should it be measured should it be qualitative   
1:13:22   
quantitative how so should it be like just contributor retention or should it be uh the kind of work that is getting   
1:13:29   
done compared to the cost because at that point I'd also attended a session uh talking about like what goes on   
1:13:35   
behind the funding of open source communities so that was also a big thing in my mind and oh Yeah. So that was what   
1:13:42   
we talked about and then uh these are like some of the insights. Uh one was that like of course you need contributor   
1:13:50   
retention but then you the main thing is like the project health needs to be maintained. So you also need to get new   
1:13:56   
people and retain old people which is like tail as old as time but uh also   
1:14:02   
something that was discussed in quite uh detail with like everybody's own experiences. Then another thing that   
1:14:08   
like a lot of maintainers who attended like the maintainer of the Misa Foundation and the maintainer of music   
1:14:14   
brains attended this and a thing that they said was like uh like good enough   
1:14:19   
is like actually better than perfect cuz they don't want because uh if contributors if they are focused on like   
1:14:25   
perfect and they give too many critiques people lose interest in contributing and at some point it's software it will be   
1:14:31   
agile. So you know it just needs to be good enough to go in this release. So that was something that like according   
1:14:38   
to them was like quite important for long-term sustainability. Um and then I introduced that like you   
1:14:44   
know we are using agent based simulations for modeling and at the end like they were also really interested in   
1:14:50   
those like graphics and all that I show. So quite some people like came up in the end and we like uh send us links to this   
1:14:57   
uh it looks quite interesting and um yeah so another main major thing that I   
1:15:03   
wanted to talk about with them was quantitative versus qualitative metrics because uh like many indicators I feel   
1:15:10   
are subjective and how do we actually you know try to see even if we're looking at a community see if it's   
1:15:16   
sustainable. So some of the metrics that we talked about were like so one was retention   
1:15:22   
which of course like could be done checked by like GitHub PR whether this person is contributing for X amount of   
1:15:27   
time. So it is quantitative but like it is it was like agreed upon as like this   
1:15:32   
is one of the base indications of you know whether this person is motivated to be in your community. So that was uh one   
1:15:41   
thing. Then like another thing that someone suggested was like lines of code as well. So I also pointed out that this   
1:15:46   
was also something that we had modeled in one of our 2022 models where like uh it's not not every PR is the same. So   
1:15:54   
there could be like a basic earthshot, moonshot versus like a Marsh shot um   
1:16:01   
this and also like these notes are not final. So I'm just making this for the rest. Uh and then another metric was the   
1:16:09   
engineering health and the product health. So engineering health was like activity tracking. People also mentioned   
1:16:15   
like um two of the people from two differents uh mentioned that they   
1:16:20   
actively use like these softwares which basically are like what GitHub um those   
1:16:28   
GitHub like squares do but like on steroids where like it tells you everything tells you like how many PRs   
1:16:35   
who commented who raised a bug and like gives you like a very zoomed out view of   
1:16:41   
it in terms of graphs. Uh so they are basically like they track your health   
1:16:46   
and especially uh they mentioned that it was especially useful when there were multiple repositories.   
1:16:53   
Um so any org that kind of uh deals with   
1:16:58   
multiple repositories uh and like so GitHub does not sync across them. So   
1:17:04   
like they were highly encouraging to use these and they did mention like those these tools had to be like deployed   
1:17:10   
themselves. So they were like a bit difficult but like if you are an or that heavily relies on uh knowing your user   
1:17:18   
base and your contributor base so this was like a quite an important uh and worth it uh thing to do. Um and then the   
1:17:26   
other also like uh indicator that people discussed of sustainability was the fact   
1:17:32   
that product health. So like just understanding what your contributors or your developers are doing is not enough.   
1:17:40   
Um like you also need to understand the product value to the user base and like   
1:17:46   
the user base is quite important as well uh for actual sustainability of your   
1:17:52   
community. So uh taking user surveys feedback. So that was also like a great   
1:17:58   
uh metric that people suggested and that's of course like it is quant it is   
1:18:03   
it can be like quantified with like an insight. Somebody can say that yeah if user always are mostly positive that's   
1:18:10   
good or there can also be like you know people also discussing that there can be very edge cases where we notice that   
1:18:16   
mostly people only comment when it's something negative or only leave a review when it's something negative. Uh   
1:18:22   
so that can of course skew the results which is needs like a qualitative insight to know where you actually put   
1:18:27   
that. Uh but then it is also at the end of the day a good metric and you need to   
1:18:33   
like make decisions about the quantification um like just not just what the   
1:18:40   
contributions are. Uh and then the other other main thing that I wanted to discuss was like how do all these like   
1:18:47   
human factors and especially the communication which was like something that I tried to model in my 2024 project   
1:18:53   
as well. So how does that uh come together for a healthy community? So   
1:18:59   
like should it just be code contribution or like how much of a metric is the   
1:19:04   
communication part of it? And everybody agreed that like if you're talking about community like sustaining the community   
1:19:09   
like the communication is a very important part of it. Uh one is like uh   
1:19:15   
you know also we discussed like how do we invite contributors into our um   
1:19:21   
community and the first thing is like um you need to not make it very like domain specific as well. Uh and then being like   
1:19:30   
warm and welcoming. uh someone mentioned that like they make it a point to reply to every uh single message that is   
1:19:37   
dropped on their IRC no matter how small it is no matter you know if it's during the Google summer code season where   
1:19:43   
there's like a lot of them but uh they do reply to everything   
1:19:48   
because it's important for like people to know that this is an active community and they are welcome there then another   
1:19:55   
thing that was discussed was um like you need to also protect their community because they like about three People   
1:20:01   
shared this experiences with like toxic contributors where uh unfortunately they   
1:20:06   
had to like either fire them or ask them to politely step aside because they were   
1:20:11   
uh making everything so either about themselves or trying to be so perfectionist and everything that it was   
1:20:18   
detrimenting the m like the overall project. And like another thing that   
1:20:24   
everybody talked about was like the fact that it should spark joy. So it was like even though like it's a very indirect   
1:20:30   
metric but the overall community should be happy and that's the only way to   
1:20:35   
sustain long term. Um then also a big point was that uh there's not just   
1:20:41   
contributions are not just code. So for a lot of people contributions are in the form of data that the users give back   
1:20:48   
that the users upload. for people contributions are in the form of like workshops that people take teaching   
1:20:56   
other people to use their product. So documentation and you know in just   
1:21:01   
active community engagement was like a main thing. Um there was another like   
1:21:06   
major thing that like there are main contributors in every project and then there are hobbyists that just do a few   
1:21:12   
bugs or something and that's like a um differentiation that can that has to   
1:21:17   
be qualitative but that is something that makes difference because losing a main contributor does much more harm to   
1:21:24   
your sustainability. So that was one thing and then there   
1:21:29   
were like some suggestions on how to prioritize feedback and communication especially for some people that were   
1:21:35   
facing it actively in their communities like there was someone from the processing foundation uh who was the I   
1:21:42   
think the project leader of the p5.js GS file um product and uh library and uh   
1:21:49   
they were saying that like because the majority of their users are school teachers and they don't want to already burden them um they're already quite   
1:21:56   
burdened they don't want to you know increase it by saying tell us what's good with our product contribute to us   
1:22:02   
but then there were suggestions on like how they could do that or they could pick a time where like uh there is   
1:22:09   
summer school is off but like it's important to get active feedback from your users and then another discussion   
1:22:16   
was like the need for hierarchy. So especially for like big communities   
1:22:22   
you cannot just let everybody do it on their own. So what or even the maintainer cannot do it all on their   
1:22:28   
own. what uh Robert Dave suggested the maintainer of music brains was he suggested that he has the idea of   
1:22:33   
keeping lieutenants where they help to share work and each lieutenant is in   
1:22:39   
charge of like a particular component and then they know what to do with   
1:22:44   
everything regarding that what contributions to accept what PR to review and also what like actively new   
1:22:51   
features to take up and also if there is someone doing something wrong doing   
1:22:56   
something toxic uh the lieutenants also help out in that instead of just one single maintainer.   
1:23:03   
Um and then another thing was that that use like especially when it comes to funding and everything. So users were   
1:23:10   
like one of the main things for long-term sustainability. Like everybody shared that like you know it was very   
1:23:17   
important for users to have uh users to be like the for a for a   
1:23:23   
product to basically have as many users as possible before trying to figure out   
1:23:28   
how to sustain it. So make a good product make a good better user base.   
1:23:33   
And there was this like 2% uh somebody suggested the 2% campaign rule where like um 2% of users typically end up   
1:23:42   
contributing. So a large engage user base is like the key to long-term sustainability.   
1:23:48   
So there was that. There was another thing which people discussed is like negative incentive where like they   
1:23:53   
notice that if the website goes down or there's a issue in the product that is when one a lot of people get engaged in   
1:23:59   
the community and unfortunately that is also when a lot of donations come into the community even though like donations   
1:24:05   
a lot of people accepted like donations are not what drives the community like that's not the source of their funding   
1:24:11   
but uh that is what help that is what like gets people interested as long as a product is working fine uh people tend   
1:24:18   
to ignore ignore the surveillance and tend to ignore everything. And then someone also discussed how like the   
1:24:25   
community how the community reacted when they closed the old bug report actually led them to believe that yeah this is a   
1:24:31   
feature that a lot of the community uses that they actually didn't know. So there are these like very minute things as   
1:24:38   
well that can um indicate uh what actually is the users and the developers   
1:24:46   
are both facing. So yeah that was like mainly about the session that I conducted   
1:24:53   
and uh apart from that there's also like quite a few interesting and important   
1:24:59   
people I met. Um so uh right after the session there were two people. So there was Kit from the processing foundation   
1:25:07   
who said that she would you know like to use the um she was interested in like all the graphs and metrics we made   
1:25:13   
during the um uh GTO projects and she   
1:25:19   
asked for links for all of those and uh there was also um   
1:25:25   
I'm going to have a bit of trouble pronouncing his name but I believe I   
1:25:30   
from the who's like the maintainer of Misa Foundation and again like he said   
1:25:36   
like yall are doing stuff on agent based modeling and I really like the UI that was built especially for the 2024   
1:25:43   
project. So since we have everything to do with agent based modeling we you know   
1:25:48   
we should connect and kind of try to see if we can get this sort of UI incorporated in MISA as well. Um and   
1:25:57   
then apart from that uh I also attended a few sessions. uh one was from uh   
1:26:04   
Andreas uh who works in GSBML and he's like he's the professor of   
1:26:09   
bioinformatics in some university I forgot the name of the university but uh   
1:26:15   
he basically held uh he held a lightning talk and also session about how to get   
1:26:21   
people like the lightning talk was about what his organization does and the session was about how to get people more   
1:26:27   
interested in bioinformatics and like the various things that they face such as like um like in the discussions one   
1:26:36   
of the things that everybody faced was like data formats and then so the gatekeeping of data so there isn't   
1:26:42   
enough data because a lot of it is curated by private hospitals and it's then payw wall um so yeah I also like   
1:26:50   
talked to him about uh deorm a bit um and that is someone that like we can   
1:26:58   
look at um and then also I attended a few lightning talks um from like uh   
1:27:05   
mentors at Scala and mentors at DBPD association. Um and um another like uh   
1:27:13   
quite important person I met was uh so there was um of upside down labs and uh   
1:27:21   
when he heard that I work in a like I was affiliated with INCF. So uh upside   
1:27:28   
down labs is like a startup based in Bangalore, India and they make DIY neuroscience kits uh especially for the   
1:27:35   
purpose of teaching and uh he basically shared his contact and I thought that   
1:27:41   
maybe uh we can you know look at this because I know in Jopro and all there are I think some kits being used. So   
1:27:48   
this is also someone that we can connect with and also like I re realized there   
1:27:53   
that uh some of uh the people from my college have also used this like bio amp   
1:27:58   
pills uh for one of the hackathons project as well. So we kind of got to   
1:28:04   
know each other there as well and realized that we have like cross arts in a way. Um but yeah that was like   
1:28:13   
uh highlevel excerpts from the this and I'll unmute now for and I'll drop also   
1:28:21   
drop the links for all of this. So   
1:28:27   
this is the upside down labs. So yeah the grimal   
1:28:34   
grim augur will put like   
1:28:41   
um the two sessions the two softwares that people suggested   
1:28:48   
so for open source sustainability and for like checking the metronome   
1:28:54   
[Music] in the chat and uh yeah scaling and user   
1:29:00   
bases definitely and Morgan I believe I don't know if you meant   
1:29:08   
I think you meant upside tabs here.   
1:29:16   
Yeah. Yeah. I think we can like everything now.   
1:29:24   
Yeah. So, thank you Sara for that presentation. That was great. I'm glad you met some uh connections and had some   
1:29:32   
pretty good discussions. Um so yeah I I mean there were a lot of   
1:29:39   
things that kind of came up here that were interesting. We had talked about chaos and augur before   
1:29:46   
um that was like a platform that where they kind of analyze   
1:29:51   
communities actually analyze things from data and you know try to spit out   
1:29:56   
trends. Uh but uh the some of the other things was that there's this distinction   
1:30:03   
between the perfect and then the sort of the good enough.   
1:30:08   
And so the good enough is actually better because people don't want to spend too much time thinking about how   
1:30:14   
to make things perfect which which is interesting. I guess   
1:30:20   
you know what that means is that the development of the software happens later out of the purview of like the   
1:30:27   
immediate sort of contributor collaboration.   
1:30:32   
Um but yeah and then and then of course you talked about some needs for hierarchy. So you know we think of open   
1:30:40   
source as being a distributed collaborative enterprise but a lot of times people will put in like   
1:30:46   
hierarchical components to that and of course you know it sometimes it is the the culture of the organization where   
1:30:53   
and we talked about this with uh Bell Labs where you have these connectors or   
1:30:58   
weak links between different groups. In this case, I guess what they're advocating for is something more   
1:31:05   
controlled or hierarchical, but you know, there are different ways you can structure your organization to   
1:31:10   
sort of facilitate um you know um cooperation and things   
1:31:16   
like that. And uh what else? Um yeah, a lot of good   
1:31:23   
stuff. Just a lot of good stuff to think about. Um so I've been present or I've   
1:31:29   
been preparing the presentation for the active um symposium on this open source   
1:31:34   
sustainability project and yeah I've noticed a lot of these same things that   
1:31:40   
we've been talking about here and so um yeah that's great. Um I'm glad that you   
1:31:45   
were able to present too uh on this and I'm glad that someone thought that you   
1:31:51   
had some pretty good uh UI skills. So um yeah definitely pursue that.   
1:32:00   
Yeah. Yeah. So I plan to reach out to him once   
1:32:06   
I get some free time. But yeah definitely. Uh yes. Also uh uh hopefully   
1:32:12   
a medium blog soon. I'm just like   
1:32:17   
trying to settle down for now but soon. Yes. Yeah. No no hurry. But it's great. It's   
1:32:23   
great to see that and to see everything going there. It's always nice to physically congregate when so much stuff   
1:32:31   
is virtual and then have a good time and then have artifacts from it and try to try to make things that sustain it over   
1:32:38   
time. Not ironically, but like you know so that'll be great. Um but good stuff.   
1:32:46   
Yes. also once I get the audio and um video and photos from then so I'll try to   
1:32:52   
share them in the Slack as well. Right. Yeah. Yeah, that would be great. So   
1:33:00   
yeah, we have a bunch of things in the chat here. the link to upside down labs,   
1:33:07   
uh the chaos, uh project and and the grim lab tool, the augur tool, and uh   
1:33:16   
yeah, and some affirmational posts in there. So, yeah. Um well, thank   
1:33:23   
you once again for that presentation. Thank you.   
1:33:33   
Oh, V had a question. Uh, yeah. So, great question. So   
1:33:38   
actually uh so like the people there uh as I said like there are two I'll just   
1:33:45   
mute for like five more minutes I'll answer uh yeah so as I was saying um so   
1:33:52   
other people there are two uh two mentors from each organization that officially invited the organization   
1:33:58   
decides who to send and mostly they send the org admins sometimes they send some   
1:34:04   
or admin or maintainer and some of the newer mentors as So for them uh it's completely legacy is   
1:34:11   
of course sponsored and uh Google also reimbures them for the flights and all   
1:34:16   
the expenditures. Um I was one of the mentors selected from the weight list.   
1:34:21   
So I was a third mentor from INCFO attended. So for that reason uh my also   
1:34:28   
ste was sponsored but uh my uh like the amount I got for the flights was half of   
1:34:34   
what the like the mentors that are officially sent get so it covered like   
1:34:40   
about I would say 70% of my flights and another thing that happened was so the the   
1:34:47   
uh summit was in Germany in Munich Germany and uh they had provided a letter to that you know I could uh use   
1:34:54   
to get a business visa uh invitation letter but unfortunately again because I was one of the mentors from the wait   
1:35:00   
list uh I got this invitation like around two to three month two two and a   
1:35:05   
half months I think before act the summit actually happening and uh in   
1:35:10   
Mumbai in India especially a lot of students are applying to Germany for their masters and stuff so due to some   
1:35:18   
reasons the visa slots were completely booked out so I was not able to get a   
1:35:23   
visa appointment to Germany So I was unfortunately like forced to go   
1:35:28   
I mean not forced I thought of like I kind of what I tried to do is uh get a   
1:35:34   
shenan visa and made a trip it with my mom and we went to Switzerland and I was   
1:35:39   
vacationing in Switzerland for 4 days and then we went to Germany. So like that part of it was obviously not   
1:35:45   
sponsored and I ended up spending but I got a vacation. social.   
1:35:53   
Yeah. And BD said, "What an experience to have." So, yes, definitely a good   
1:35:59   
experience. And, you know, um, great, great stuff.   
1:36:05   
Oh, yeah. Morgan, did you want to say something in more detail about any of that or   
1:36:11   
No, no, that that was wonderful. wonderful to hear about and um yeah I I   
1:36:17   
I certainly hope that becomes a a write up or blog post um too and um   
1:36:26   
you know it's just just thinking again about the project in terms of the things   
1:36:32   
you know I mean like we've we've talked about chaos before   
1:36:39   
um but like you know again Chaos is like   
1:36:45   
sort of an extension of   
1:36:50   
um it's kind of an extension of of the   
1:36:56   
the metrics the kind of conventional metrics that are available through the   
1:37:03   
you know it's like hey if we get people to use particular particular frameworks   
1:37:09   
and particular um uh   
1:37:15   
tools, right, that we can kind of collect more data about them,   
1:37:20   
right? Right. you know, and and yet,   
1:37:26   
you know, there were several things that Sarah was talking about that,   
1:37:33   
you know, are not captured by those things. and and you know are are   
1:37:41   
potentially things you could um have in agent-based models. um but   
1:37:49   
but are honestly difficult or certainly like the way in which we implement them   
1:37:54   
in those those um models is is   
1:38:03   
um it's it's usually a somewhat abstract,   
1:38:13   
you know, inaccurate right way. But but you know, it's um the the   
1:38:22   
great YouTube channel um   
1:38:27   
I can't remember what it's what how do how do you actually pronounce it now? It's like Veritassium.   
1:38:33   
Oh yeah. Yeah. Veritassium. It's veritas.   
1:38:38   
It's something like that, right? And you know does these kind of explanations of   
1:38:44   
technologies. He he just did one on on artificial life, you know, and and and it it's it's   
1:38:55   
you know it's it's like like the models work not because they are an accurate representation,   
1:39:02   
right? It's more like like it it's more about   
1:39:08   
it's more about the the models give you something regardless of accuracy in   
1:39:15   
terms of of of their um   
1:39:22   
accurate representation of real world things. But it is it's like it's more   
1:39:28   
just our difficulty in   
1:39:34   
being able to project what those future solutions will be from from   
1:39:41   
that kind of cellular automa or you know like game of life like um um   
1:39:50   
games right or you know like Yeah. Yeah. Um, and   
1:39:57   
I'm I'm just trying to think of the um um   
1:40:04   
the modeling framework that um that Brian was using.   
1:40:11   
Oh, the active inference uh like PBM. Yes, but he Yes, but he was using the   
1:40:18   
older he he was using like a like a Python version of that older framework.   
1:40:25   
Um, you know, it was popular Markov decision processes.   
1:40:31   
Sorry. Markov decision processes. No, I mean like like I know that was   
1:40:38   
what he Oh, the was the net logo maybe.   
1:40:43   
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. you know, I mean, you know, like like like a   
1:40:49   
tool that was used in kind of um political science   
1:40:54   
and and you know, national security applica, you know, simulations where it   
1:41:00   
was just like like it wasn't, you know, it wasn't so much about the   
1:41:06   
accuracy, it's about the um um if we assumed these things   
1:41:14   
um what would happen in these simulations and and um   
1:41:21   
um anyway the the point being that like you know I think some of those features   
1:41:28   
that that we have trouble um   
1:41:33   
finding computational representation are you know should should still somehow   
1:41:40   
be um a part of these these simulations.   
1:41:45   
or like like but with with that known caveat, right? Like like it should um   
1:41:55   
it would be more theoretical um   
1:42:00   
you know as opposed to chaos which is like somewhat more like a I mean the   
1:42:08   
chaos tools are somewhat more like a management tool. Yeah.   
1:42:13   
you know, and and I I mean, I kind of mean that in a porative way, right?   
1:42:20   
You know, and as opposed to a a understanding tool,   
1:42:27   
right? Or or a research a research project. Um   
1:42:33   
anyway um just just you know in defense of of theoretical   
1:42:40   
theoretical research. Yeah. Uh, and and this just kind kind of   
1:42:46   
comes back to my my question that that's always that always comes to mind when I   
1:42:52   
think about the open source software sustainability project, which is, you   
1:42:57   
know, what what are its goals and and what what processes are   
1:43:07   
are of most interest, right? So it's it's like I mean I I love I love each   
1:43:13   
year's you know technical um you know technical achievement as   
1:43:20   
well as you know what what that technical achievement um   
1:43:26   
focuses on right you know and and you know it's just like   
1:43:32   
like with the LLM with the agents there you know it it became very like like   
1:43:39   
I've mentioned it became very like multi- aent um   
1:43:45   
software production which you know I was   
1:43:51   
asking last year or last week like you know how much of that is um is now a   
1:43:58   
part of Claude and and um co-pilot in terms of their own you know like like um   
1:44:06   
those engineering teams. Um, and you know, I was just looking at um that, you   
1:44:15   
know, because Cursor 2.0 came out, which is definitely,   
1:44:20   
you know, um, is a team specifically focused on   
1:44:25   
that and and a team that's tried to develop their own models, but, you know,   
1:44:31   
are anyway, point being that like, you know, that's still somewhat different um   
1:44:39   
and still needs to capture what well if if you talk about it sustainability like   
1:44:46   
it it's still missing the the kind of the   
1:44:52   
human interaction social features   
1:44:57   
that that Zara talked about too um   
1:45:02   
it it's it's um Um   
1:45:09   
yeah, that that that was what was coming to mind. And and then you know earlier   
1:45:15   
with um with um you know Jess and I had   
1:45:21   
had the computational philosophy I think   
1:45:26   
it's is it the salon? I forget what he calls it. Um yeah, the uh but it was it   
1:45:36   
was I mean um fascinating to hear um the   
1:45:41   
Asthma Press uh editor's backstory and it's super interesting to hear, you   
1:45:48   
know, what what he hopes to get from the work he's   
1:45:54   
doing. You know, it's very very inspirational. Um   
1:45:59   
I I thought I you know it's like I I'll I'll ride this gig until until I can't   
1:46:07   
and then I'll I'll find something else which you know u yeah   
1:46:15   
he he has a wonderful independence. Um but uh u   
1:46:23   
in in terms of the how that relates to um   
1:46:28   
uh because he he talked a lot about uh both uh Astera the Astera Institute   
1:46:35   
as well as I mean I'm sorry Etera Foundation I forget now Astera and Arc   
1:46:42   
Institute new science group too. Yeah. Yeah. and   
1:46:48   
and like like and I and I think you could probably throw future house in   
1:46:53   
there too in terms of institutions that um   
1:47:01   
are are are set up not necessarily in in   
1:47:08   
um they're set up to be   
1:47:15   
different um not necessarily fairly, you know, separate from academia. Um, but   
1:47:23   
but certainly, you know, as as someone mentioned in the the   
1:47:30   
salon, you know, like um potentially like focused research organizations.   
1:47:37   
um which uh   
1:47:42   
and so so he he talks a lot about the what what he saw at least in those in   
1:47:49   
terms of um their own backstories and and how they wanted the researchers to   
1:47:56   
to work and to interact with other researchers and you know to set how how   
1:48:03   
they wanted them to set their metrics. Um and um yeah, so it's it's it's it's   
1:48:13   
something that you're definitely seeing, you know, again and again.   
1:48:19   
I I forget who raised the point, Jess, but it was like but of course this is this is this all requires funding and   
1:48:26   
currently that funding is coming from you know high high netw worth   
1:48:32   
individuals which is right not necessarily the   
1:48:39   
it's neither the um yes   
1:48:45   
you know this this is this is not represent and a grassroots effort and   
1:48:50   
and it um so it's I just just just last   
1:48:57   
last thing is that that like um I was I was um   
1:49:03   
with a a playd date with my daughter and her friend and and I got to meet um her   
1:49:12   
her grandfather her friend's grandfather who was um who formerly ran IBM research   
1:49:20   
and it was interesting to hear his stories in terms of of you know how they   
1:49:28   
ran how they ran their own group at the same time as Yeah. Yeah. And you know   
1:49:36   
that that IBM research also has you know   
1:49:41   
a a really you know an incredible record. Um and   
1:49:49   
both you know it his point being that like they have lots of theoretical   
1:49:56   
researchers um like um   
1:50:01   
oh oh um Bradley who's the um information theoretic uh   
1:50:09   
computer scientist um from IB IBM or   
1:50:16   
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's been at IBM forever. mathematician. Um it it is um the the minimally   
1:50:25   
computational um minimum viable comput.   
1:50:32   
He he he he also got involved in um   
1:50:38   
you know trying to he has a project trying to mathematize biology you know   
1:50:44   
which ends up being Greg Gregory Chaitton Chaitton. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.   
1:50:50   
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, so the point the point being that like like they have they have people   
1:50:57   
like Jayton who you know like are not working on anything practical.   
1:51:03   
Right. Right. Um but but also you know he he was he was   
1:51:10   
very proud of of their um kind of   
1:51:18   
business wealth creation as well. Yeah. Like like that that they had Yeah. And   
1:51:28   
you know was was I I wish I had um uh you know it would have seemed impolite   
1:51:36   
to be taking notes while I was while we were on a on a beach in San Francisco.   
1:51:42   
But um um you know I I wish I'd um been   
1:51:48   
able to hear more of these stories in terms of   
1:51:53   
of you know because of course they were they were very rare and and compared   
1:52:00   
themselves to Bell Labs. Um, well, it's interesting because I'm   
1:52:08   
clearly not old enough to know better about that in the sense of B labs for   
1:52:14   
the people that know about it and and I don't know lived it or whatever. um like   
1:52:20   
there's sort of this mystical quality to it and and I don't   
1:52:27   
like I have like I it it like I'm in a sports analogy like I'm very familiar   
1:52:34   
with like my when one of my favorite sports team was you know just excellent and outstanding and you know won like   
1:52:41   
80% of their games for like 60 years and then recently they've been trash. So   
1:52:48   
it's like the difference between, you know, the generation that just doesn't know like, oh wow, like profound versus   
1:52:56   
like, well, you know, and it's it's it's so it's so interesting to kind of see   
1:53:03   
like I was like, oh, I really should understand a little bit more about Bell Labs because I know about it and I realiz I know people there. We all kind   
1:53:10   
of know some people that were doing things that are not. Also, I wanted to say very briefly as even though you said   
1:53:15   
you were having this conversation on on the beach or whatever, in my mind for a wonderful moment, I was thinking like,   
1:53:22   
oh, Morgan and his daughter having a play date talking about stuff in a nerd circle at this like all like some   
1:53:28   
wonderful like tea party and just having like total nerd discussions while also   
1:53:34   
doing that. And I was like that was that was just a very cool moment. And I mean that in the best way possible because   
1:53:39   
like I would as a dad I would love to do that myself. Good stuff.   
1:53:45   
Yeah. Yeah. As opposed to being a a very cold wind zap windswept beach   
1:53:52   
where where we're kind of like huddling behind, you know, the any kind of cover   
1:53:57   
we can find. Yeah, exactly. San Francisco beaches could be, you   
1:54:03   
know, we're not LA. Yeah. Well, I was even going to say like even by by the   
1:54:09   
Charles River here is a pretty like especially this time of the year, it's like well right   
1:54:14   
maybe not the picturesque society and somehow kids somehow kids   
1:54:21   
have a completely different you know sense of temperature. So they're still getting wet, you know,   
1:54:27   
like Yeah. Anyway, but   
1:54:33   
sorry. Yeah. Yeah, that would have been nice. I I was I was hoping that we could   
1:54:38   
uh that I could have, you know, invited him over for dinner or something like that because it was really interesting.   
1:54:45   
Um well and and like to to go back to um   
1:54:52   
Fast Press stuff like yeah your point I do I I don't know like   
1:54:58   
I I feel like I want to say something like mildly mildly insightful about but   
1:55:03   
like I don't know what there is to say about like the the the billionaires and and the the big the big people funding   
1:55:08   
our you know our stuff and it's like   
1:55:14   
like if you were I have a very real talk suggestion with with with the young people right now about this. It's like well you know it how do you get funding   
1:55:21   
to do some of the things and and how do you do that and how do you how do you make yourself legitimate and rigorous   
1:55:27   
and and present and I thought it was interesting because I think I forgot his name Nico I think um   
1:55:36   
you know he he kind of he kind of direct I don't know if it was overt but he he   
1:55:41   
basically suggested like his own model was like just write about it and then try to reach out about it and see if people will will do it like like subse   
1:55:49   
has kind of created a bit of a platform, but then it's like, you know, it that's   
1:55:55   
it doesn't make it easier. And the real the real problem of funding quote unquote science or quote unquote like   
1:56:03   
I almost want to use a different term domain space awareness and doing things   
1:56:09   
in those spaces that amounts to knowledge generation   
1:56:14   
which may or may not be science. call science or not, you know, like like that whole thing is like, yeah, what do we do   
1:56:20   
about that? So, it was it was a good discussion from there and and I'm really curious as I don't know if this was said   
1:56:26   
or or implied, but like kind of what I was saying in my first round of all this   
1:56:32   
stuff was, you know, like there's a conversation that came up there that I feel like Bradley's discussion from this morning   
1:56:38   
and what we're talking about here and and Dan Vanzan who's who's one of the   
1:56:44   
stuff with the Wolfper Institute, he Dan Vanzan's really like this little little   
1:56:49   
project on like trying to understand, you know, like alternate research   
1:56:54   
organizations or like like new new new kinds of research groups trying to do   
1:57:00   
research and stuff like that. And I'm I'm really I'm basically trying to organize I would like to have more in   
1:57:06   
basically another version of discussion like like post the next phase of discussion and I don't like I don't know   
1:57:13   
what organizational banner it is but I think there's literally I think there's a very important discussion to be had   
1:57:19   
and even even from the um by the way this is this is kind of an   
1:57:24   
interesting tangent I'll try to put here right now um at the uh summit at the um   
1:57:33   
uh augmentation lab summit. Um, you know, this was came up because part   
1:57:40   
of part of the second panel which I wrote about in my my slipstick um was,   
1:57:46   
you know, about funding and and these people from the 1517 and and and the   
1:57:54   
other like Prospera and people there's people different different groups doing   
1:57:59   
different things like that and um like it's kind of a conversation that   
1:58:06   
that I I kind of we've talked about here and it came over there. There's an ongoing conversation that should be   
1:58:12   
harnessed a bit more. There's a slight tangent to that. Um if you're interested in Ken Leo, the the author who was also   
1:58:18   
at the event, there's a open um augmentation lab is talking with him today and you could you could like talk   
1:58:24   
to him at 4 pm Eastern time that they interested in that. So I put that in the chat. But but more more directly like I   
1:58:31   
think there's a conversation to be maintained and I'm actually interested in trying to I want to talk to like Dan   
1:58:38   
and Addy from Prolapto and maybe the guy from Asimov and like there's a critical   
1:58:44   
mass of people there like we can have more meaningful discussions ahead. So I   
1:58:50   
don't yet know how to structure it. Um, but I do want to do some things about about that. even if it's as simple as   
1:58:56   
just demarcating the space and offering a suggestion because I think   
1:59:02   
people don't like people don't you know there isn't really like a a a   
1:59:07   
playbook or I mean there there's a lot of like I don't know marketing playbooks sorry for but like if you're just coming   
1:59:13   
up through the system and I think about a lot of terms like a lot of what I think about these days like what is the   
1:59:18   
curriculum that should exist that doesn't exist about this and that's kind of why the future center   
1:59:24   
exists in one sense, right? Um, but like what should a person know like if   
1:59:31   
they want to do XYZ, how do they do it or support it or like know that their   
1:59:37   
work is contributing to something adjacent to it or you know what is like   
1:59:42   
the landscape? So I'm I'm trying to Sorry, but are are we talking about funding or are we talking about about   
1:59:50   
the skills to do the work that they want to do? I thought we started out I mean you know   
1:59:57   
like like you know the the question I'm invariably asked is   
2:00:05   
um do I stay in academia or do I you know become a become a founder and and I   
2:00:14   
I always you know come back with like how is that   
2:00:21   
different you know um in the sense that like you know e either way you know   
2:00:29   
you're you're talking about a a task that is not the work that you   
2:00:37   
are trained to do you know that that it's it's I mean you know who   
2:00:44   
who suggests that that it's that it's um   
2:00:50   
um performative And and I mean or like like I mean I   
2:00:56   
just wanted to say that like yes I think the what what was important for   
2:01:04   
him to start Azimoff Press was you know both his his experience in biology right   
2:01:12   
which is very much his you know like traditional training right but but then   
2:01:20   
you know he he obviously had that magic or he he went and then went to went to journalism school um which not all   
2:01:28   
journalists say that you need to do but but I think it is a great opportunity. He's he spent some time just focused on   
2:01:36   
writing, you know, and and um   
2:01:41   
you know, as as a trade, right? And you know, certainly I'm always super   
2:01:49   
impressed with PIs that I know. The successful PIs are all people who who,   
2:01:56   
you know, craft a great story from from the work that they they've done with   
2:02:04   
with that like, you know, um   
2:02:10   
with a just a just a little hint of like make, you know, a dash of like making it   
2:02:18   
better than it actually is. than it actually is, right? Like   
2:02:23   
misrepresentation. But I, you know, sorry, the um   
2:02:30   
um who's the uh the the political science statistician   
2:02:36   
at Colombia? Um um oh   
2:02:43   
all these books in my head and I can't remember the um he wrote um blue state red state   
2:02:51   
poor state anyway the the the you know there is a fine line between that dash   
2:02:57   
of just making a little better like and like becoming a you know self-promoting   
2:03:05   
Um um well and that's like reminded me of expert writing very much like like the   
2:03:13   
the concept of of that but yeah to your point like I think I think you're very   
2:03:18   
yes yes yes about um funding and then the skill set and then not just being   
2:03:24   
performative like there's an actual structure like when I meant hoops in a more in a more formal like in a   
2:03:31   
non-performative sense I meant like there's things you're going to have to do whether it's a funer or head of a   
2:03:37   
private lab. That's that's not your academic training. It has nothing to do with the the   
2:03:43   
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And it's like that's and there's, you know, there's like even like the Athos Foundation here and   
2:03:50   
elsewhere like there are people that are trying to like facilitate that and maybe that's maybe that's some place that I should, you know, I' I've been   
2:03:56   
interviewing with different like program manager jobs and things like that and and it's it's really interesting to see.   
2:04:04   
I think I think that informs a little bit of my recent I don't know what where it's like oh   
2:04:10   
like the the the the managing of the   
2:04:15   
operations and then like the interfacing of the   
2:04:21   
operations with the real world stuff are these like other other things than just doing the specific domain work and how   
2:04:28   
do you how do you facilitate that? So yes to like how do you get the funding and then how do you support   
2:04:34   
like that kind of stuff particularly as like the bigger institutional   
2:04:39   
like there isn't really about labs anymore I guess and and and higher acade higher education is you know um   
2:04:48   
very I mean especially I mean you could say especially right now like it's it's a weird time um and there's a lot more   
2:04:54   
to say than that about things that aren't just 2025 but like   
2:04:59   
I don't Yeah. So like like two, you know, a couple things that came up   
2:05:05   
during the computational philosophy salon. Um I was when um what was his name? Van Vans. Van   
2:05:13   
Vanzant. Yeah. Yeah. Van it it made me think of um   
2:05:18   
David Crackour talking about technological progress.   
2:05:23   
Um, I mean, in terms of of trying to, you know, like   
2:05:31   
what are the forces that go into these these um   
2:05:38   
and and and this this old British TV show called Connections with um   
2:05:46   
Burke, I think that was his name. Um that was there was this wonderful like   
2:05:51   
like you'd never you'd never guess the kind of you know the the the backstory   
2:05:57   
of technology and and how how little it had to do with like what the person was   
2:06:04   
you know formally working on. Um and and then one one last thing which   
2:06:11   
is um um you know is at the big brain conference and um Alan Evans who who   
2:06:20   
leads it. Um so big brain conference is is is just about basically like neur   
2:06:26   
imagers settling on one brain and and you know slicing it at like one micron   
2:06:32   
thickness. Um but but He was talking he was   
2:06:37   
introducing another he was introducing a researcher at uh at ULIC and he was just   
2:06:43   
like you know I I forget the guy's name like the the great thing about Marcus is   
2:06:49   
that um he's one of those he's one of those people that um is always working   
2:06:55   
on stuff that he's not supposed to be and and he and he said something like   
2:07:01   
like every every great research organization needs needs a Marcus. Yeah.   
2:07:06   
Yeah. And and you know and like like again I I   
2:07:12   
I think there's you know I don't know if there's like the perfect org   
2:07:19   
you know um or or like you know the perfect you know whatever the perfect or   
2:07:25   
is it has to have somebody who's the the destabilizer if they work   
2:07:31   
right. No. Exactly. I I had a conversation with someone looking to build an organization   
2:07:38   
very recently and it it to I'm sure we have other things   
2:07:45   
we want to talk oh it's actually super late so I was about to really quick sorry I didn't realize how long the time   
2:07:51   
it was um I'll just say it's such a balance too even ahead of time because   
2:07:57   
the the size and the scope of the organization really depends on like if you want to very you want to tackle a   
2:08:02   
very specific problem, you're going to have to be have a very   
2:08:08   
clear vision about it and bring people that are like are going to be like tow the line of it or like be company men   
2:08:15   
for that for that process mostly, but you need enough room to do to the actual   
2:08:21   
work of exploration too. And as you're you know and that changes like when that   
2:08:26   
changes your scale or pivoting or scope or funding or like okay well now we want to do this that can change a lot of   
2:08:32   
those things and it's very challenging to it you know kind of like greatness   
2:08:39   
cannot be planned of it part of it is like you can't you can't   
2:08:44   
I'm I'm I'm very interested in people that want to solve very specific problems and I'm I'm it's sort of this dilemma between let's solve a specific   
2:08:51   
problem and How do you have like you know that what you said like there's no perfect organization but there's a   
2:08:57   
certain amount of like kind of like some ideal maybe alostatic   
2:09:02   
points or ratios of like this much divergence versus this much you know   
2:09:08   
dogma if you will or like this much prescribed plan of action about what you should do um and so on. So there's I I   
2:09:17   
feel like there's so many ways I keep going. So I'll cut it up there and and offer Bradley to say what you you want   
2:09:23   
us to keep talking anything or not. Well, I think this is a good stopping point and I think that was a perfect   
2:09:29   
kind of ending point that every organization sort of needs someone who can kind of do what they're not supposed   
2:09:35   
to be doing and be a disruptor and that sort of thing, whatever. But but like a   
2:09:40   
Claude Shannon type at at Bell Labs. Yeah. And and like there's a special like not just saying you need this elite   
2:09:47   
it doesn't have to be magical but like there's a certain like they have to be able to do that within the security of   
2:09:53   
the organization not falling apart. Yeah. you know, or like something outrageous happening or like okay, well,   
2:09:58   
we all want to do this stuff now and then it like a certain like does the thing hold the structure or not, right?   
2:10:05   
And that that the tension and like how do you manage that? Like is it just luck or does is there enough like emotional   
2:10:10   
literacy to to balance like those are like very interesting questions and um   
2:10:16   
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I guess that's where we'll leave it for today. Um, thank you   
2:10:23   
to Sara for her great presentation. Thank you to Morgan and Jesse for their discussions. And um, see you next week.   
2:10:32   
Thank you. All right. Take care everybody. Take care.

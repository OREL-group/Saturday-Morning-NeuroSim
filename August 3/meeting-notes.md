## NOTES
Jesse — Admin meeting.

Some things looking ahead. 

visualize, conceptualize a project, working group, and how would a person do this?

language for interdisciplinary projects?


Semester ahead. Connections to Boston and UAlbany.

herding cats: each node has a great degree of non-uniformity. Components are harder to manage than the sum.

 strategies — not all will win, but all will have influence.


Grant Writing — must talk about things in a very specific way.

outcomes must be specific (artifacts, results). 

not just having an influence on something else.

formalization of projects. Project cards — how to find chunks of right size for participation and project refinement.


Experiential learning: I am a Cogsci research, Neuroscience, AI lab….


Specific solicitations for [[areas of interest]]. Work to build out project, mention specific activities, opportunities.

model builder — Cybernetics.


Lukas — working on coding part of OpenWorm studentship. Related to new paper in Biosystems.

 Blast API — turn data into JSON formatted file, turn into an automatic thing.

project card — Studentships (informal).


Clinical AI event — why are we using AI to model intelligence —> help people, profit motive?

AGI talk — goes in the direction of longtermism, EA stuff.

progress — vs. intelligence, superhuman? Exceed human benchmarks.


Topical playlist — Space —> industrial-strength NLP.

general intelligence —> multiple cognitive functions. ARC challenge (ground work needed to meet challenge, beyond current capabilities of AI).

how do you win the challenge (domain-specific language)?

Douglas Adams — “deep thought” — will super intelligence give us what we thought? 

principle of “keeping it alive”.


Polyvagal theory — domain unspecific aspects.

regulatory states constrain behavioral options.

embodiment as a general intelligence.


Action space needs to be defined —> ARC challenge should theoretically be easy.

Karl Friston: life and movement.

need new machinery that doesn’t exist — languages, hardware.


Simulations on connectome data.

recovery of function from connectomics.


Economics of Behavior — Levin talk.

* revisit Boids, flocking — bird migration as a set of universal laws — get intelligent behavior that is also efficient.

Jesse Parent says:
also to talk about later
- morgan potentially in Boston! 
-comp cog neurosci at MIT
- unsure if I can go to the event, but, definitely up for trying to cross paths or generically being in cambridge/boston/around mIT for a bit

Jesse Parent says:
I'd really like to see  both of thes articles, esp relative to 'critiques' of IQ 
Jesse Parent says:
spectrum how to do the iq of AI 
Jesse Parent says:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.G.Y._(What_a_Beautiful_World)
 
Jesse Parent says:
even polyvagal theory has language grounded in "emergent properties' of which regulatory state you are in 
Jesse Parent says:
re different dimensions of intelligence: 

yes evolutionary imperitive, "having to keep alive" as a factir

and, how 'measuring" or "tracking" evaluating something as a means for a human being to look at it and undersatnd it VS how things actually operate relative to their expressed and easily visualized or measurable outputs

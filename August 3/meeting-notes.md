## NOTES
Jesse — Admin meeting.

Some things looking ahead. 

visualize, conceptualize a project, working group, and how would a person do this?

language for interdisciplinary projects?


Semester ahead. Connections to Boston and UAlbany.

herding cats: each node has a great degree of non-uniformity. Components are harder to manage than the sum.

 strategies — not all will win, but all will have influence.


Grant Writing — must talk about things in a very specific way.

outcomes must be specific (artifacts, results). 

not just having an influence on something else.

formalization of projects. Project cards — how to find chunks of right size for participation and project refinement.


Experiential learning: I am a Cogsci research, Neuroscience, AI lab….


Specific solicitations for [[areas of interest]]. Work to build out project, mention specific activities, opportunities.

model builder — Cybernetics.


Lukas — working on coding part of OpenWorm studentship. Related to new paper in Biosystems.

 Blast API — turn data into JSON formatted file, turn into an automatic thing.

project card — Studentships (informal).


Clinical AI event — why are we using AI to model intelligence —> help people, profit motive?

AGI talk — goes in the direction of longtermism, EA stuff.

progress — vs. intelligence, superhuman? Exceed human benchmarks.


Topical playlist — Space —> industrial-strength NLP.

general intelligence —> multiple cognitive functions. ARC challenge (ground work needed to meet challenge, beyond current capabilities of AI).

how do you win the challenge (domain-specific language)?

Douglas Adams — “deep thought” — will super intelligence give us what we thought? 

principle of “keeping it alive”.


Polyvagal theory — domain unspecific aspects.

regulatory states constrain behavioral options.

embodiment as a general intelligence.


Action space needs to be defined —> ARC challenge should theoretically be easy.

Karl Friston: life and movement.

need new machinery that doesn’t exist — languages, hardware.


Simulations on connectome data.

recovery of function from connectomics.


Economics of Behavior — Levin talk.

* revisit Boids, flocking — bird migration as a set of universal laws — get intelligent behavior that is also efficient.

also to talk about later
- morgan potentially in Boston! 
-comp cog neurosci at MIT
- unsure if I can go to the event, but, definitely up for trying to cross paths or generically being in cambridge/boston/around mIT for a bit

Jesse Parent
Jesse Parent says:
I'd really like to see  both of thes articles, esp relative to 'critiques' of IQ 
Jesse Parent says:
spectrum how to do the iq of AI 
Jesse Parent says:
see also: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.G.Y._(What_a_Beautiful_World)
 
Jesse Parent says:
even polyvagal theory has language grounded in "emergent properties' of which regulatory state you are in 
Jesse Parent says:
re different dimensions of intelligence: 

yes evolutionary imperitive, "having to keep alive" as a factir

and, how 'measuring" or "tracking" evaluating something as a means for a human being to look at it and undersatnd it VS how things actually operate relative to their expressed and easily visualized or measurable outputs

Transcript     
0:01     
hello hello     
0:06     
hi hello Trevor morning how are you all     
0:12     
right glad to hear it great     
0:18     
welcome so yeah let's start out um we have any updates start out with     
0:27     
updates um mostly     
0:32     
as I as I told I met with Bradley earlier this week and we can talk about it later     
0:38     
um we discussed some things ahead for the semester which was good to do most     
0:45     
of my actual work this week and it's so funny because it's it's still in the cusp of     
0:54     
uh being like something to show     
1:00     
but it's been so much work a lot of Joe proo stuff like like uh I've spent a lot     
1:06     
of this week     
1:12     
um um working on how to     
1:18     
both sort of uh visualize and like I've been spending     
1:26     
time on the website but it's much more than the website um     
1:31     
it's it's uh it's like conceptualization     
1:36     
of what what are like these components of like a project or a working group or     
1:46     
a you know how do you identify what a what a person is doing in in these     
1:52     
things um and how would you display that both     
1:57     
on the website but also in general so just a lot of I don't know administrative work I guess     
2:05     
um I spent a lot of time looking at     
2:11     
um you know what how how what is the language that is used by     
2:20     
people who are trying to offer interdisciplinary     
2:26     
research to people that are um hosting several projects or     
2:33     
coordinating projects uh things like that that that's been a lot like majority of my week has     
2:39     
been around that um you know in terms of     
2:45     
this on this front anyway uh but um it's been it's been really tough like it's     
2:52     
been tough because i' I've I'm actually quite proud of myself even though um     
3:00     
I I feel like it's just me talking about it but I'm really proud of myself in the sense of every day I've really uh put a     
3:08     
lot of effort into this and um it's     
3:13     
been it's been good and and I feel like I've learned uh some important things that     
3:21     
way um but beyond that functionally uh there's there's a few other updates in     
3:28     
terms of um maybe we'll talk more about this later but um kind of in line thinking about     
3:37     
master uh i' I've been looking at some of our past sort of orel's Partners in     
3:44     
terms of we've had various um I don't know collaborations with like     
3:52     
my you Al which is which is the school I attended in the past uh and some things     
4:00     
that with with the school I'm currently with and some new things that may slowly be     
4:08     
in development here and more in the Boston area in general so     
4:13     
um it's been a week of mostly just     
4:20     
unpleasant tedious like semi web development a lot of project admin a lot     
4:27     
of like research the the Deep ugly things about research     
4:33     
and organizational like research organ management at a at an organizational     
4:38     
level um and some sort of networking and and     
4:47     
um meeting you know seeing the virtues of doing some things on on on campus and     
4:53     
getting FaceTime with people which is something I I I hinted I I hinted very lightly at at stuff about that uh in     
5:01     
yesterday's meeting um the open source summer code uh summer cohort meeting um     
5:09     
so maybe more on that later too but but um just uh you     
5:16     
know this this week in another sense my I will conclude by saying this week has     
5:21     
been a a lesson in just um to to bring things into existence it     
5:31     
requires a very specific uh intention to do so yeah and sometimes     
5:38     
you have to tell to engage other people about above it oh     
5:44     
yeah cryptic sounding but like especially in Academia dealing with     
5:49     
these like both vague and potentially bureaucratic systems like there's just a     
5:56     
certain uh I've actually been thinking about it in terms of of sort of like uh     
6:01     
regulation which is um in in a different way part of the poly bagle Theory stuff that came ear     
6:08     
last month uh but but also like in just a feedback control sense like like there's a certain regulatory influence     
6:15     
you have to just maintain to to shift the state of certain things so maybe     
6:21     
more about that later but that's my that's my major uh opening Wally of updates for now well that's good um yeah     
6:29     
we did have a meeting on Wednesday we talked about administrative stuff so     
6:35     
yeah we're we're looking towards fall and next spring basically this coming Academic Year and trying to build out     
6:44     
collaborations and to build out relationships with different universities and you know other     
6:50     
opportunities to do things to move forward our projects so that's a lot of stuff that     
6:57     
you know we kind of talk we put on the table and I said you know we're not     
7:02     
going to of course do all of this in the fall or maybe even all of this ever but     
7:07     
it's worth putting our our cards back out on the table and seeing where we are so yeah um and then the     
7:14     
intentionality part yeah I mean you really it's hard you know to really kind of manage uh research in that way     
7:22     
because you're always having to I don't want to say her cats but it's it's really about like how helping the     
7:30     
process alone and you can't just let the process help itself alone you know yeah     
7:35     
that that's exactly that's exactly almost exactly how I described it     
7:41     
to uh I'll put it I'll put it this way because     
7:47     
um someone was was doing new things uh a new grad student yeah was dealing with     
7:54     
some things and I I explained it to them that way in a sort of mentoring session I suppose     
8:00     
and I was like were a bit like oh jeez I I can't     
8:06     
[Music] um I sort of I don't know beused it's     
8:11     
the right word but it's was like oh how come it how come it worked when I like     
8:17     
approach the the people interfacing part of the     
8:22     
problem this way versus versus that way or I talked to this person and and it     
8:27     
unlocked these set of options this side options and it's like yeah it's it's     
8:32     
kind of like hurting cats basically and what we mean by that is like each P each component doesn't     
8:40     
there's a huge amount of like non-uniformity and maybe even some     
8:47     
nonlinearity but like at least non-uniformity and like when you move this     
8:53     
way this person or this aspect changes in this particular way and     
9:03     
there's I I think Randomness isn't quite a fair word but there's a there's a there's a quite a peculiar relationship     
9:09     
between the different components sometimes and I was saying to the to them like look especially in like I     
9:16     
don't even it's not just Academia but it's sort of this Academia SL like     
9:21     
particularly research particularly inary research particularly like startup spaces or when you're doing something     
9:27     
like really novel um it it it kind of gets to the point of like uh having     
9:33     
multiple lines of like Solutions or lines of influence there's a there's a     
9:39     
specific word for this at forgetting but like when you have different when you see different like strategies that will     
9:46     
result in the outcome you want knowing that they're not all going to win but they can all like you know have an     
9:54     
influence and just sort of realizing that that's a norm and a lot of people or     
9:59     
conditioned away from like seeing it that way or thinking oh well I don't want to interfere with things or it's     
10:05     
not my place to say this or whatever it's like yes but um there's an element to     
10:12     
just understanding that that's you know part of things     
10:19     
so more about that later perhaps but I totally I totally     
10:25     
uh I'm in line with what Bradley was saying yeah so I mean that's very different than the way we usually fund     
10:31     
research or I shouldn't say that I should say the way that the funding agencies fund research sometimes they     
10:39     
fund it on promise but a lot of times it ends up being like you know what can you do in this period of time and if     
10:47     
something has long-term promise you know maybe it gets funded it probably doesn't get funded just on that alone and so     
10:54     
like sometimes you know if you're doing with startup that's maybe more of what you're doing is you're funding things     
11:00     
for the future and then of course promise you know needs to be there later     
11:05     
I guess uh or else it you know people pull their funding or you can't raise more     
11:10     
funding but yeah I mean having that decision making you know where you're not saying I'm going to pick winners but     
11:16     
I'm going to pick influential projects where you know sometimes I'll spend six     
11:22     
months to year on something and it'll be an influence on something else or it'll be you know something that will build to     
11:30     
something else you might not produce a a concrete tool or a concrete outcome but     
11:38     
it does contribute to that other thing that's that's kind of what you're referring to and I think in a lot of     
11:44     
like research that's important it's an important component um and that's not the way we     
11:50     
think typically thinking about managing projects or funding     
11:56     
projects and I think it's even like not to turn this into too big of a rap     
12:02     
session about it but um I I I think it's um it's really     
12:10     
uh at least what I've learned or what I've what I've come to to realize um in     
12:17     
my um Growing Experience I guess is     
12:25     
um it's it's very like code switching it's very uh to to to go between the     
12:30     
different environments and like if you're getting a specific if you're trying to get a specific Grant you know     
12:37     
you have to um present present ideas in a very specific way like like that's     
12:44     
part of that's kind of been re like uh indirectly reinforced by everything I've been looking at like when you're when     
12:49     
you're when you're thinking about how do you talk about the work you're doing in a way that's public facing grants like     
12:59     
related to a grant or or getting like things from either like a media     
13:05     
attention standpoint or just an accessible standpoint for the people that the the the organizations that are     
13:13     
going to look at it and say okay here's how you how are you talking about this in a way that fits you know whether it's     
13:20     
like uh someone investing in stuff demo or die things or or like a Federal grant     
13:27     
they're all they're all kind of uh it it's all it's different and and     
13:34     
and and and knowing the different ways     
13:39     
of communicating it's almost like meta it's not just science communication or     
13:46     
or top like one of my early Pi which I I     
13:52     
admire for how she introduced this because I can't I can't remember how she did but it was a really good way of doing it but basically     
13:59     
in the context of being a researcher it was it was like going all the way down from like way deep down into what     
14:06     
individual components of in this case like the the brain or biologist doing up     
14:11     
to higher level to like systems and then and then doing from actual physical things to Theory and then Theory to like     
14:19     
products and products to like you know like what's this paper it's deliverable in the lab at the time I like that was     
14:25     
cool but it's almost like that plus this other level of now     
14:32     
realizing how you how you communicate that and even talk about that to like a     
14:38     
prospective labmate or a funding person or in the startup space or other spaces     
14:43     
it's all different and and and it's all like you can't you can't you know if you     
14:48     
are talking about it in a certain way um to certain like audience and people with     
14:54     
different intentions uh it it won't necessarily hit uh unless you're doing it the right     
15:00     
way you have to sort of code switch you have to be aware of that this this is like     
15:05     
super you know higher level administrative and and like almost like research strategy just sort of I don't     
15:12     
know if that's a real like field but I feel like that's I feel like that's a thing like     
15:19     
like strategic initiatives of research and Innovation I don't know if that's a     
15:25     
thing but it feels like that's something that I'm constantly put in the position of having to deal with and think about     
15:32     
because it just I don't know this probably why I bring up here so much     
15:37     
like I don't know where else to talk about as well so I see Lucas is here maybe he can give an update in a minute     
15:44     
on what he's doing but I wanted to talk about a few things before then so let me share my screen so I mentioned that we     
15:51     
did a A administrative meeting on     
15:56     
Wednesday and I I mentioned about these project cards that we've had in the past     
16:02     
where I tried to summarize some of the initiatives in the lab and put them on     
16:07     
these cards where people could read them over it was more of a social media device where we put them on on social     
16:13     
media people could read the and get more information about the projects and I was looking back at them and I was like well     
16:20     
this is this was definitely a first attempt at this so uh let me pull this     
16:25     
up so this is okay so these are the project cards uh     
16:32     
some of these are empty because we never really filled them out so they themes like developmental AI like and I think     
16:39     
we've talked about this I think we did these project cards like     
16:45     
2021 maybe updated them in 2022 so they have a little bit of uh time on them and     
16:52     
so developmental AI is something we at the time were working towards as a     
16:57     
project and I think since then we've decided that that's more of kind of a a in in-house theme that we're kind of     
17:04     
building from so you know maybe this is a an idea maybe this is a specific     
17:11     
project and and noticed like going through these P these these cards that we've had this a number of times where     
17:17     
we have these you know kind of General ideas of things that we're interested in and you know trying to make a card out     
17:25     
of them may or may not make sense so you know kind of getting the right unit of what the project is that you want to     
17:31     
engage people with is the key so this is one example where you have the education     
17:37     
and content streaming stack this is an idea where you know we wanted specifically to and some of these things     
17:45     
are pretty dated um where we wanted someone to do things with social media     
17:50     
with education uh delivering education through uh like you know the the     
17:58     
discussion Channel we have the YouTube channels we have and things like that putting together sort of this virtual um     
18:06     
education and content and making it useful to learning and research     
18:12     
collaboration and so you know we have this as sort of an idea um the another one is innovation     
18:18     
and open science so you know again like we have all this stuff and open science     
18:23     
and it's kind of like at the point where it isn't really a formal project that we     
18:29     
do so like if you go to the website or the lab you know you have some of these formal projects but you also have these     
18:36     
kinds of things that are not really formal projects they just kind of exist on their own that we talk about a lot     
18:44     
we've done some things on but not really built a project around and what it the point one of the points of these uh     
18:51     
posters or cards is that it gives people an idea of a a unit that they can grab     
18:56     
and grab hold of and start working with for themselves that's why we're doing this and and again these cards are you     
19:03     
know pretty dated uh but they have ideas in them     
19:09     
this is one that Jesse had here technology Society ethics La     
19:15     
philosophy and we have some of this yeah takes you back doesn't it it takes you     
19:22     
back yeah like origins of society ethics Tech which is actually a thing now and     
19:27     
like a banner that that did things yeah yeah you know some of these we' we've     
19:33     
actually worked out more so like this is like this this chunk is now kind of     
19:40     
society ethics Tech and then within that we have chunks that someone could grab     
19:46     
hold of so in other words we could take this card and revise it to say this is     
19:51     
part of society ethics Tech and repurpose some of this text the deliverables I think are pretty much uh     
19:58     
um you know just I don't know we maybe need to update this for things that you     
20:05     
know for very for more specific types of chunks that we want people to grab hold of so you know     
20:11     
within Society ethics tech there may be some issues around just philosophy or     
20:17     
just ethics so you know have a call for that and then the deliverables are more     
20:23     
specific this is just kind of boiler thing uh so this this actually you know I think     
20:29     
we can update these but we have to think about kind of what we want out of them     
20:35     
so yeah this is reconstructing cybernetics which never really got off the ground I mean we never found anyone     
20:42     
wanted to do this stuff but we did do some things we have done some things with papers and with some meetings and     
20:51     
you know meeting uh series and things like that where we've driven this forward so now we have to go revise this     
20:57     
card according to that but really this just kind of describes the kinds of things you could do with reconstructing     
21:05     
cybernetics so I mean I'm not sure what level of specificity to make this you     
21:11     
know I'm just kind of thinking about how to repurpose these cards in a way that makes sense and then developmental     
21:17     
brenberg Vehicles this is something that's a very you know has a very specific set of of deliverables you can     
21:25     
work we have uh for this initiative of course we worked on these developmental BR Vehicles we have a paper on this we     
21:33     
used to have a working group on this we have open source repositories so we have very specific things that you can engage     
21:42     
with so this is much much more specific and something like reconstructing cybernetics which has a lot of     
21:49     
opportunities to sort of Forge your own path conceptually speaking but is still     
21:55     
you know something that needs to be updated and is more specific than this at this point     
22:02     
so uh yeah I wanted to pull those up I've been meaning to do that for a while uh you know but but the idea there is     
22:08     
that you know we have this set of tools that we you know maybe uh guide     
22:15     
guidelines for participation we want to link back to the projects we want to refine those     
22:21     
with respect to the projects and maybe it'll help us refine the projects more     
22:26     
in the process yes     
22:33     
um I don't know I want to say this is what can happen based on what I've been     
22:39     
doing this week but um I I'm I'm I'm I'm at least looking into sort of     
22:47     
formalization of some of the like nature of developing a project and and I've     
22:52     
spent a lot of time this week kind of comparing different ways and it's it's     
22:58     
different because because of because because of to kind of go back to what brother     
23:03     
said earlier like it is different when a lot of like generic like I don't want to say generic but I'll say I'll say     
23:08     
generic here sure generic funding and product development is oftentimes of a     
23:15     
different nature um so when you're dealing with an     
23:20     
interdisiplinary or nebulous space um or like doing things in a way that just     
23:25     
hasn't rarely been done at a conceptual ation or development of idea level it's     
23:31     
a different kind of it's just a different um other than okay here's an established you know here's here's an     
23:38     
established trainer thought with a very obvious you Journal a very obious funny path and a very like you know an     
23:43     
established discipline and you know here's here's sort of the beat path of that it's just a different kind of thing     
23:49     
so um having the discussion and having the opportunity for people to see what's     
23:56     
going on and then formulate you know staging the development of the idea and and the research project itself is is     
24:02     
its own path so yeah um I guess what I'm what I'm saying outside of my weird Meta     
24:08     
Meta talk here is um let's look at the cards um and I     
24:15     
don't know if um you know it's it's going to be one of     
24:22     
those things [Music] where uh previous like for concrete     
24:28     
example previously with the ver University at Albany um we've had to submit like one     
24:35     
we've had to present ourselves as oh we are an organization someone can come along and do undergraduate research     
24:42     
experience with or get uh experiential learning with here is our here's what we     
24:47     
offer in terms of this and that um so a lot of those a lot of those posts     
24:55     
or submissions or like postings of what happens are like I'm a con science research lab or I'm a neuroscience lab     
25:01     
or you know or I'm from the U you know different different labs and and organizations across the campus so what     
25:08     
we've done in that case is present not necessarily these cards but sort of uh     
25:14     
something that's Broad in a Bott of space to say here's some topics we're covering and here's what it potential     
25:20     
can be there that's University of Albany and it's um that's sort of one way in in     
25:28     
situation where you're you're you're kind of constrained about what you can convey but where I'm going with this is     
25:35     
that I think reviewing the cards is is a good step for us to get to we can do     
25:40     
specific solicitations for let's have an intern on model building let's have an intern on reconstructing cybernetics or     
25:47     
whatever we don't to we don't to make all these things and it's sort of this mixed between you can kind of just make a whole bunch of open internship     
25:53     
specifications if you want to we've done that in the past and they exist in different places um but if you really particularly want     
26:01     
if we want to promote something specifically as an intention for the you     
26:06     
know fall semester uh we can make that choice and and like try try you know be     
26:13     
a little bit more intentional about making an advert a solicitation or a call for involvement or a call call for     
26:20     
whatever um about that topic I envision myself doing that for like cognition     
26:26     
Futures maybe even specific Society ethics Tech uh because there's a few things in it like I'm interested in some     
26:33     
of the like some of the data science work I've been doing in my actual grad program um there's a few Outlets of     
26:39     
things I want to get there and they have a the most immediate home for them would be Society ethics Tech because be like     
26:45     
data ethics is right there in the middle of of all those things so I mean I     
26:51     
Envision um making something around that but I'm also you know as putting my     
26:59     
putting my lab manager hat on specifically if we want to do other things that way I'm happy to     
27:07     
like work uh to build out okay you know     
27:13     
we like we've kind of talked about brain organoids a lot um would are we at a place where we could mention that you     
27:20     
know or we talked about we're kind of doing things with a cybernetics reading group but it's not quite reconstructing     
27:26     
cybernetics but maybe it is and uh there's the model building stuff I know Bradley's I don't know if you're going     
27:31     
to talk about that later but you're doing specific things in that space you know um we have these Google summer code     
27:38     
things that are going on and we have a history or at least a potential things     
27:44     
that have happened in the past is where someone stays on with that through fall and builds it out um either with with us     
27:52     
or excuse me sometimes getting um different friends learning     
28:00     
um different ways that helps them out through their school as well so like with the academic credit or not like     
28:06     
those are different Pathways to go with those sorts of things so finding you know conveying all this and putting     
28:11     
these options on the table are things we can do um between now and the next to the next month or so I think yeah yeah     
28:19     
look forward to it so yeah this week we did a number of meetings uh we had the evor meeting so     
28:27     
that was actually an update that I gave um and that was on a number of different     
28:33     
papers that I wanted to cover And discussing the kind of things in in that     
28:40     
space um so check that out on the D.A one YouTube channel um then we had an administrative     
28:47     
meeting on Wednesday which was of course Jesse and myself and we talked about this sort of thing in more detail so um     
28:55     
and then uh yesterday we had our open source meetings was Jesse and Morgan and our G students um and you     
29:04     
know we talked a lot about sort of different the different progress in different projects so we have our open     
29:12     
source sustainability project we have two people working on that and the graph neural networks project which of course     
29:20     
we had an update on that and then we talked a little bit at the end about some initiatives that Morgan is involved     
29:26     
with with neuro Fedor things like that and so that was our meetings for this     
29:32     
week Jesse said also to talk about later Morgan might be coming to Boston or     
29:38     
going to see Jesse in Boston maybe or just going to Boston uh there's uh I think Morgan's     
29:45     
coming here for much other reasons than to see me but yes of course to see me ultimately no I think there's     
29:53     
some there's a conference the computational cognitive Neuroscience conference at M     
29:59     
which is happening that's why he's going to Boston but yeah and and some other     
30:04     
things but yeah if it it happens that's cool I don't what you're saying unsure if I can go to the event     
30:11     
but definitely trying to cross paths or generically being in Cambridge Boston or on MIT yeah that's always good to have     
30:18     
like you know you go somewhere and you get in you take it so get in the     
30:23     
environment yeah okay so I don't know Luca hello how are     
30:30     
you Hi how are you guys doing um so I'm just here to um I think um Bradley I     
30:38     
asked a question um from Bradley and then he asked me to uh join the uh meeting today     
30:46     
just to talk about something but yeah to give you guys an update uh I'm currently     
30:52     
working on the um on the coding part of     
30:57     
the project so just to give uh for the people who don't know I'm working on my     
31:04     
uh student open warm studentship and the project that I decided to do is kind of     
31:11     
related to our recently published paper uh in biosystems so um what I used to     
31:18     
what I did in that project which is related to the um genomics of seans was     
31:26     
to um do a bunch of data collection and some     
31:31     
parts of protein analysis so um I could uh just send the link of the project     
31:38     
here just to uh show you guys okay [Music]     
31:50     
yeah um     
31:59     
yeah so it's um here um so um if you guys go to     
32:09     
the um so there link to the paper basically     
32:15     
yeah that's linked to the paper which um yeah it's mostly so what I mostly did     
32:20     
was protein count so I use the blast uh URL blast uh tool on NIH to do     
32:30     
the protein counts so my um open warm project is just turning trying to use     
32:37     
the API of uh the blast API to     
32:43     
uh turn the results that you get from blast to a Json format which is the easy     
32:51     
part however the harder part of the coding project is to uh     
32:58     
uh so because I did all the protein counts manually so um now I'm trying to     
33:04     
find out okay I I get the J the results in the Json format how like     
33:12     
hypothetically I could just like I don't know how I have to um     
33:18     
kind of turn that from a manual thing to an automatic thing because what I used     
33:25     
to do was that okay I get the result from the blast sech and then I look at     
33:31     
the proteins because sometimes there might be duplications sometimes blast gives you a name like it might be     
33:38     
another name for the same protein so uh yeah that counting part might also be     
33:45     
done manually I don't think if there's a way to uh do it using coding and stuff     
33:51     
like that so yeah my question today from Bradley was to um ask him how the second     
33:58     
part of the project works because um like the second part of the project is     
34:04     
to use the protein counts or like um the protein counts to um so we use this data     
34:11     
to model um the embryo of C lians which I I     
34:17     
don't really have a lot of uh I haven't done a lot of training or like I haven't been doing a lot of modeling so um I was     
34:26     
wondering how we use the pro protein count results to model the embryo of cus     
34:32     
um so yeah that was my question and then after that I could just put this all     
34:38     
together and U like publish it on the repository and     
34:44     
do uh finish my Jupiter notebook that I started okay well I think in the second     
34:51     
part of the project you know the idea is to take the the protein data of course to to sort of     
34:58     
get that analysis in a higher like kind of the form that we did for the paper     
35:03     
you know we did the queries together a data table to automate that process so we can at least to some extent so we can     
35:11     
get uh you know we can go maybe find other proteins or whatever and I think we talked about adding proteins to the     
35:17     
list and getting that pipeline worked out so the student ship you know doesn't     
35:23     
need to be a huge amount of work uh it just needs to be some usually f focused on     
35:29     
bioinformatics and getting those tools worked out and then you know that that     
35:34     
allows other people to pick it up and use it for for other reasons um now the second part you     
35:42     
know this is going to be where we in openworm one of the things we do is we     
35:49     
take data from different sources it's usually something like you know a     
35:55     
primary paper or it could be like a a genomic uh like ncbi a genomic database     
36:03     
where you have access through apis or through uh different interfaces     
36:08     
different file types to put together data sets that are you know annotated     
36:13     
that have some uh provenant in the in the genome or in protein space and then     
36:19     
you know put those together to do what you want to do so you know with the what you have now is this group of proteins     
36:27     
you have some information about them you know um I don't know if you have you     
36:32     
know I guess you can go get the sequences if you want I don't know that's something that     
36:37     
is um useful for what we're doing but um you know we at least have the IDS and we     
36:43     
have that pipeline worked out so once we have that then we can     
36:49     
attach the proteomic data to models of the embryo so I guess what I'm saying     
36:55     
for the second part is we're not really ly modeling it modeling the embryo     
37:00     
proteins we're trying to attach the proteomic data to things in the embryo     
37:05     
in the embryo model and the embryo model being this these other data that are put     
37:11     
together and and you know so we can attach the protein data to that model in     
37:16     
different ways so what we have for an embryo model is basically you know cell     
37:21     
information so cell location information cell time information so how long is a     
37:28     
cell alive and so different developmental cells will you know Divide     
37:34     
from their precursors and then they'll divide again and those cells are around for a certain amount of time so we have     
37:40     
those cells we have their position we have uh information about     
37:46     
you know different regions of the embryo so the different movements of the embryo and how the cells sort of migrate     
37:53     
during that process so we have all this information about you know development     
37:59     
we also have information about laral worms so we have this similar models in     
38:05     
larvel worms we have cell information their position their timing you know the timing of larvel periods we even start     
38:13     
to get some uh data on on the neurons at     
38:18     
that point and the synapses so we have a lot of information in that model now     
38:24     
none of that of course is genomic data so that's what we're trying to incorporate into the models and so for     
38:31     
in your case you know you have proteins you have that Pipeline and there two things I'd like to do with that so I'd     
38:37     
like to attach the genomic data that we have that we got from the paper and that was     
38:43     
larly something that I did and that's something that is not as automated and     
38:49     
maybe you know we can walk through how maybe to automate some of that but I don't really want to focus on that too     
38:55     
much um but to to attach the genomic data that I have um that we can get and     
39:04     
large we just creating like a file you know downloading a file of the data     
39:09     
doing some search operations within that data getting some numbers and then     
39:14     
attaching that to the protein data and then you know attaching that to     
39:20     
the embryo so um I'm not really sure how we want to do that yet so it might be better just     
39:28     
to kind of for the second part just to attach genomic data to the     
39:34     
proteins and then kind of put it in a framework and I'm not I'm not quite sure how to do this yet so bear with me to     
39:42     
attach it to the UMO models because the data isn't for specific cells and you     
39:49     
know this is something that is kind of a an issue with a lot of secondary data     
39:55     
sets we can't really make statements we can't attach it to single cells we can     
40:01     
attach it to to the embryo itself and uh a more General aspect of     
40:07     
it so I guess what I'm saying is we need to think about how we might attach the     
40:14     
protein data I'm not sure what that looks like in terms of a     
40:19     
deliverable um definitely like attaching a certain type of genome data     
40:27     
and Analysis to that and then attaching that to the embryo models generally and     
40:33     
then maybe another project would be to kind of look     
40:38     
at um you know maybe we can get data for specific cells I don't really think we can     
40:43     
do uh proteomics at the Single Cell level at least right now but we     
40:49     
definitely have uh you know the data for the entire embryo so we can make statements about that but that's that's     
40:57     
where we are with that so um I I'm I guess what I'd like to see     
41:03     
from Lucas is I'd like to see the Jupiter notebooks I don't know if you can send me a link I don't know if     
41:08     
you're working on GitHub but that would be good to have that up on GitHub and you know send me a link to     
41:15     
the repository where we have the notebook I can look through the     
41:21     
notebook look at the work I can make notes in The Notebook on you know what needs to be improved or what you know     
41:28     
how that's going to fit together with the data that we have okay yeah I'll do that uh after the     
41:36     
meeting is done I guess yeah but yeah makes sense so um yeah because the first     
41:41     
part like um using the blast URL to um turn the results to the Json format that     
41:50     
part is uh like pretty much the easier part of the coding yeah but like the     
41:55     
second part is what like really um kind of like frustrates me because I can't     
42:01     
really figure out a way to do it and also like um the open form projects like     
42:07     
entire uh like the entire purpose behind doing the project is uh to be uh is like     
42:15     
going out there doing a bi bioinformatics project for and showing     
42:21     
others how to do it so I'm not sure how useful it will be for the others other members of the community um that's why     
42:28     
um yeah we we have this project but like I want to make it most useful for others     
42:36     
so yeah that's what I'm thinking about well I think the resources that exist in the over Community are a little bit     
42:42     
divorced from what we're doing here so like you know they don't do a lot of stuff with molecular biology they do     
42:49     
like cells uh we have like ion channels I think and some other things of course     
42:56     
we're focusing on the neurons a lot so we have that type of data but attaching     
43:02     
like proteomics data to that is a challenge because it's like well you know we didn't really think about that     
43:08     
so like you know and and of course the specific proteomics data that you're     
43:14     
that you did for the paper wasn't really neuronal or it wasn't explicitly     
43:19     
neuronal we could do that but you know if you have this pipeline down where you can get things from the API bring them     
43:26     
into adjacent set of Json files that allows us to go and find proteins that     
43:31     
are more neuronal specific we can find different candidate proteins depending     
43:36     
on the question we're asking and then we can attach it to the model so you know it's not enough just to say like I have     
43:43     
this list of proteins that's it because we have all sorts of you know questions we might ask and because it's a general     
43:51     
model it's just kind of like you know I might be interested in one set of     
43:56     
questions someone else might come and ask another set of questions now the benefit of using Json files of course is     
44:03     
that that's a what a lot of the other uh open room data that's the     
44:09     
format that they use they use the Json format and of course that allows us to associate metadata with the numeric data     
44:17     
so if we have some numeric data that's useful we can attach information the metadata and the metadata is what we're     
44:23     
going to link to the actual model so if we have like a specific protein name and     
44:31     
a specific annotation or function and you know some information about the isoforms and other things and I know you     
44:37     
had a methodology for like normalizing that so uh that's that's important     
44:43     
because you know we're kind of we could go down a rabbit hole with proteomic     
44:49     
data and linking it to specific things in in the work but um you know that's     
44:56     
where we would make the that connection is in the metadata like you know yeah yeah yeah     
45:04     
okay yeah that's great right yeah so I'll do H what you asked me to and hopefully we can uh figure something out     
45:10     
yeah thanks all right good thank you thank you for the update and yeah again     
45:17     
you know um it's kind of hard for me to meet off hours like that so I don't know     
45:22     
if we have like another time well we can meet sometime I'm sure we find we'll find a     
45:28     
way but yeah the the open room student ships are great um and you know it's not     
45:34     
meant to be like this exhaustive thing it's just meant to get people experience     
45:39     
in bioinformatics and it's meant for people to take data that's out there and get it into a format we can use and     
45:46     
that's very valuable because you know there's a lot of data we can use     
45:52     
that's so I I mean I'm seeing this and I'm just because of everything just been doing and talking about I love to sort     
45:58     
of make a project card as as we're saying here or a project description on     
46:05     
things I'm doing for websites of the student ships because people I think have heard about them and I knew about     
46:10     
them I don't I I don't think I'm uh gon to be able to pursue one myself or     
46:16     
anything like that but more like I think it's a great opportunity that dorm and openworm has so I'm both like kind of     
46:23     
recording what lucus is doing in his own project which is really cool which is mentioning other people that that's a     
46:29     
thing I think would be an exciting you know we can we can I don't know I don't know I mean I guess I have seen a few     
46:35     
things about it in the past but I have to up ref update myself on like how open     
46:40     
worm talks about that and it's great to see Lucas you know diving into that here yeah well it's something that's been     
46:47     
pretty informal to I mean it's been pretty informal they kind of like offer them to people who work with with the     
46:55     
different uh senior contributors and open room so you know like we had one     
47:00     
year we had someone who kind of refactored the blender model of the C Elegance so that was just like making     
47:08     
the blender model bringing it up to speed in terms of the Python so went from python 2 to Python 3 making it     
47:15     
easier to like download the blender model and work with it and that's like you know again it's a project that would     
47:22     
not get done unless you offer some money and offer some um you know some time     
47:29     
guidance yeah attach it to something like but uh yeah I mean it's     
47:35     
it's you know it's it's something it's pretty informal and but that's what happens a lot of times you know there     
47:41     
are a lot of opportunities people don't know about that's why we have these cards because they help people see them     
47:48     
oh yeah there's this thing and I didn't know it existed there's this opportunity to collaborate I didn't know existed     
47:54     
so yeah okay so thank you for that update Lucas     
48:00     
um and so let me move on I have some things to talk about here uh we have     
48:05     
some features uh pry interesting stuff so first thing is the general Channel     
48:12     
I'll bring your attention to that we have a couple new people on the general Channel we have ven uh trovati who uh     
48:21     
joined I think this was on the invite of um well I invited him but it was also so     
48:27     
Hussein who met him somewhere and he he's doing this stuff with neurotech and this is something that     
48:34     
Morgan uh is interested in of course and uh I think ven is interested in both     
48:41     
organoids and sort of neurot tech and so there's a really interesting possibility     
48:48     
to make some collaboration happen here um and so I don't know if we want to set     
48:53     
up a meeting or what but we'll figure something out so that's V and then there is Ben Hong     
48:59     
who's um is uh an assistant professor of neuroscience at Wild Cornell and he has     
49:07     
he's doing this really interesting stuff with uh like I guess it's Neuro Imaging     
49:13     
live neuroimaging where you know you have a he has a population of mice and     
49:20     
they have these uh subcortical arays that they put on the head of the mouse and they can track uh uh you know neural     
49:27     
activity when they're doing continuous behaviors so when they're navigating a maze or something like that so he has     
49:34     
this whole platform around that but his interest uh for this is also theoretical     
49:40     
he wants to develop you know uh certain theoretical Frameworks you know he he's     
49:46     
interested in ecological psychology he's interested in systems neuroscience and by that I mean like um     
49:54     
complex systems dynamical systems so you know he's like I actually I     
50:00     
talked to him through a neurom match so did Jesse and we talked about that um a     
50:06     
little bit but yeah I'd like to meet with I'm gonna try to meet with him um     
50:13     
you know in the future so we can kind of maybe drive some collaboration forward     
50:18     
here and so yeah there a lot of lot of ideas here but we need to capture them     
50:23     
and direct them in a certain way so I want to just bring that those two people     
50:29     
to our attention so that we can get maybe you know people are interested in collaborating that they can meet with     
50:35     
them and that sort of thing so um let me     
50:40     
go on to some of the car or some of the other articles that I have here so this is I think this was actually     
50:47     
from the slack or I'm not sure uh no this couldn't have been from the slack     
50:53     
this was a couple days ago so this is an article on uh this uh we talked about     
50:59     
the ark project or the ark prize this is France W's Arc     
51:04     
prize and uh this is uh this title this is from my Triple E Spectrum new     
51:11     
competition seeks to un unstall AI Pro AGI progress so unstall means that we     
51:17     
want to sort of drive it Forward because it's stall so you know this is the idea that     
51:24     
you know our know of machine learning and deep learning and all these methods     
51:30     
you know where we're increasing our research or we're increasing our knowledge but are we getting closer to     
51:36     
some sort of artificial general intelligence so that's what the the arc prize is meant to sort of uh Drive     
51:43     
progress on we've talked about the arc prize before but this is uh you know this has to do not only with the     
51:50     
technology and the methods but also the notion of intelligence or artificial     
51:55     
general intell so the idea here is to sort of get like go Bunch marks to sort of figure out how     
52:04     
to maybe characterize intelligence better but also to get closer to some     
52:09     
sort of intelligence uh that we can simulate so uh says the arc priz will     
52:15     
test AI models abilities to infer a rule set it's never encountered before such     
52:20     
as filling in only the squares in an image that are fully bounded by Green squares so this is where you know it's     
52:26     
not just about training a model and generalizing the U that training set     
52:32     
which we've talked about it is hard on its own but dealing with things that a     
52:37     
system has never seen before um and I wouldn't even call it out of     
52:42     
distribution um Behavior it's more like uh out of concept Behavior or out of     
52:51     
conceivable inconceivable Behavior something like that and you know we can do that as humans we can do that you     
52:58     
know other animals do that of course as well but we don't have you know we don't     
53:04     
see the the path through simulating so you know artificial     
53:10     
intelligence models are constantly contending to crush performance benchmarks of course we have performance     
53:15     
benchmarks but those only are kind of you know tell us something about how accurate the model is or how much you     
53:23     
know loss it it uh you know it can minimize uh but these models have been slow to     
53:29     
surpass AI IQ tests and so there's an article here from itle Spectrum how do     
53:35     
you test the IQ of AI and that article is again you know     
53:41     
about building these um type of AI IQ tests that can probe for concept     
53:48     
learning and analogical reasoning and you know there are a couple of examples here of human IQ tests where you know     
53:56     
can we just apply those or do we need to like come up with our own kind of tests     
54:02     
now that that that being said of course human IQ tests are flawed in a lot of ways and so you know measuring that is     
54:08     
going to be difficult especially since you have to measure IQ within the context of sort of a population measure     
54:16     
which is you know problematic we've talked about this before um and so this     
54:22     
is uh this there's a a bit of work that's been submitted in their IPs where     
54:29     
they' they've kind of been working on this theme so um yeah this     
54:34     
is okay so I have a thing in the chat here Jesse says I'd really like to see     
54:39     
both of these articles especially relative to critiques of IQ I'm going to get to that um yeah so there are two     
54:47     
articles here so this article uh to really judge an AI smarts give it one of     
54:52     
these IQ tests and this other article on uh new competition seeks to unstall AGI     
54:59     
progress so there these you know this just kind of talk the     
55:05     
interview Fran a little bit um ultimately The Arc prize is trying to     
55:11     
accelerate AGI research through fresh ideas and innovate Innovative open source Solutions as well as speed up the     
55:18     
timeline for AGI so franois says right now we're stuck in this large language     
55:24     
model only world uh so like a lot of what we consider to be like intelligent     
55:30     
behaviors L language models generating text generating you know things that     
55:35     
look intelligent we don't know if it's actually intelligent but it's you know     
55:40     
but LLS are not by themselves intelligent they're more like a way to store and retrieve knowledge which is a     
55:47     
component of intelligence but it is not all that there is so you know storing     
55:54     
retrieving knowledge you know like memory or you know like uh maps of the     
56:00     
environment those are a component of intelligence but it's not necessarily all there is to intelligence so you know     
56:07     
we have like good models of so I think memory retrieval and you know some good     
56:13     
models of representations of the environment and you can generalize from that which means you go back to that     
56:19     
model and you like basically extract information out of it and you build you     
56:24     
know some you know in the world but that's not all there is to intelligence so really defining this is is hard and     
56:32     
this is you know trying to carve it at its joints I guess is the point and so getting down to the arc prize you know     
56:39     
it's developing some technique that can be useful uh Julian togelius     
56:46     
uh who's at New York University agrees that there exists a bit of monoculture     
56:52     
we're using the same few architectures all the time so using the the standard architectures the state-of-the-art     
56:58     
architectures may not actually get us give us a full view of what how to simulate intelligence we use like say     
57:05     
neural networks and there's certain things you can do well with neural networks and certain things you can't do     
57:11     
well and so we only really kind of benefit from the things that neural networks do well and as a result we kind     
57:18     
of focus on those aspects of intelligence so I think this is you know kind of a     
57:24     
nice set of articles but then there are also some critiques of this this first     
57:30     
article from no is the danger of superhuman AI is not what you think so     
57:36     
this is um uh by Shannon Valor this is an essay     
57:43     
uh the rhetoric over superhuman AI implicitly erases what's most important about being human and so this is sort of     
57:51     
a critique at this idea of superhuman AI so the idea that you know if we measure     
57:56     
intelligence as a certain set of things or at least we have a concept of intelligence as a certain set of things     
58:03     
if we just simulate that and surpass human performance on those tasks that we     
58:09     
have superhuman intelligence and so that's that's I guess one way to do this     
58:15     
but the problem of course is that's not really all there is to intelligence that's not really like you know I think     
58:23     
a good definition of intelligence where if you exceeded a performance Benchmark     
58:29     
you have become this it's become the Superhuman technology uh so kind of this     
58:36     
kind of draws from a lot of the rhetoric that happens in the field um you know where people talk about superhuman     
58:43     
capabilities of models and really what they mean is it's like you have a human performance Benchmark and you exceed it     
58:50     
and so you know maybe there are things that machine learning does a lot better than human learning or biological     
58:57     
and it's because machines do those things better and so you know it's it's kind of a you know we have to think     
59:03     
about the definitions of intelligence again and kind of the definitions even of our benchmarks so this is uh this is     
59:11     
a it kind of goes through she talks to yosu benio who talks about superhuman Ai     
59:17     
and she's you know kind of finding this to be like kind of a communication barrier because you know a lot of people     
59:23     
when they think of superhuman intelligence maybe don't think of the     
59:29     
kinds of things that researchers are thinking and so thinking about the dangers of these kind of systems you     
59:37     
know that that leads into that kind of whole discussion as well um and so this kind of goes through     
59:43     
the critique so this is what Jesse actually one of the things he was talking about here um     
59:49     
so the idea that computers work on the same underlying principles that our brains do is not a new one computation     
59:56     
theories of Mind have been circulating since the 20th century origins of computer science there are plenty of     
1:00:02     
cognitive scientists neuroscientists and philosophers who regard computational theories of Mind as a mistaken or     
1:00:09     
incomplete account of how the physical brain works but it's certainly not a bizarre pseudoscientific view it's at     
1:00:17     
least conceivable the human brains at the most basic level might be best described as doing some kind of     
1:00:23     
biological computation so we've talked about this where just because you you know the     
1:00:29     
computer has an analogy with minds or brains that it may not be doing the same     
1:00:34     
types of things you know you might not be able to characterize machine performance as analogous to human     
1:00:42     
intelligence and the performance of such and you know making those kind of     
1:00:47     
analogies has a cost which is that we misunderstand what the models what the machines are doing we misunderstand     
1:00:54     
intelligence and so forth so yeah this kind of talks a little bit about this and unpacks it a     
1:01:01     
bit now I would you know I would say that like there's a lot more discussion here this is just one view on it um and     
1:01:10     
you if this is one quote here once you have reduced the concept of human intelligence to what the markets will     
1:01:15     
pay for then suddenly all it takes to build an intelligent machine even a superhuman one is to make something that     
1:01:22     
generates economically valuable outputs at the rate an average quality that exceeds your own economic output     
1:01:29     
everything else is irrelevant so this is really kind of going through a lot of like kind of     
1:01:35     
pretty good yeah assumptions of why we're trying to build superhuman AI in     
1:01:41     
in in the first place is because they're these economic imperatives that are     
1:01:47     
driving and it's it's it's so like it's so wild because just I know this is a     
1:01:54     
tangent but like I was at like literally     
1:01:59     
at um an event earlier this week at like     
1:02:04     
it was a hell it a clinical AI event and it was just funny because there was a moment when in the talk was like why are     
1:02:10     
we doing all this stuff and the guy was just very transparent saying like     
1:02:16     
well it's like it's to help people right it's like I mean we're doing it for the     
1:02:22     
there's a huge profit incentive to do this and it just this sort of I'm not I'm I'm I'm not I'm not trying     
1:02:29     
to be Sensational about it at all more a sense of people have to understand     
1:02:36     
at the the the people guiding where funding and     
1:02:43     
ideas go are influenced by that and not in like in a nefarious way it's just     
1:02:48     
that's a factor like they feel like that paragraph ENC capsizes it really well and there's it's just so weird because     
1:02:55     
different like the the amount of like hey understand this is a it's a difference between     
1:03:01     
saying this is a factor and being uneasy about it or being a factor and and     
1:03:08     
treating it like it is a factor versus kind of not really talking about it but it exists anyways and I think I think     
1:03:15     
it's just so interesting to see which part of the discuss especially about AGI     
1:03:21     
stuff because a lot of a lot of AGI talk tends to go in the direction of     
1:03:27     
very futuristic long-term people long-term stuff or I mean like EA stuff and I think you know all like electri in     
1:03:34     
Elon Musk podcast space uh and and there's there's there's sort of like     
1:03:39     
varying degrees of how do we talk about that from a sense of like what is what     
1:03:44     
and that that that same statement to to really I'm G to give back the mic after this     
1:03:52     
statement but but like that that paragraph is so nice because it applies across many different fields of study     
1:03:59     
it's not just the AGI talk it's like that's a major part of the evolution of     
1:04:04     
what we now call mental health spaces or like Psychiatry and DSN like that's a factor too where where did um these     
1:04:12     
things come into play and how are the metrics designed that     
1:04:18     
are there's interesting relationship between science empiricism and what can     
1:04:25     
be measured and what can be measured and what can be put into well more of this number is better     
1:04:34     
yeah well yeah I mean in in like a lot of the and we talked about that one paper where they tried to Define     
1:04:40     
intelligence based on the literature like you go to psychology you go to clinical studies you go to I guess AI     
1:04:48     
even where they're all different definitions and so using a metric across those areas is kind of Frau from     
1:04:57     
and and that's that's I I have a longterm thing I working on is exactly     
1:05:04     
that in the sense of in lie of there     
1:05:09     
being certain like I don't I would just I know some things are just like ancient     
1:05:16     
philosophical questions that don't have answers but some things aren't that some things are just     
1:05:21     
actually immature fields that we haven't done developed enough to talk about in     
1:05:27     
ways that are sufficiently useful or articulate so in Le of having that what     
1:05:33     
is a much more tenable way to you know reference progress or or monitor     
1:05:39     
progress in a space you I think I think that's a really key concept that that     
1:05:46     
has shaped much of you know how things are now but we don't really how do we talk about that right but to be to be     
1:05:53     
more direct yeah like intelligence in and of itself I think that's that's a that's something that I think is     
1:05:58     
something I don't know if it's a up to a project C but it's more like a specific uh theme that I think is is I'm     
1:06:06     
I'm very glad that we talk about here periodically because uh it it is a factor like like we don't we're kind of     
1:06:13     
having to uh it it's it's related to the challenge     
1:06:20     
that I brought up many different times about like synthesizing uh     
1:06:26     
you know from a conference or a book like or even set of discussion like okay     
1:06:31     
we're all talking about this stuff we don't we don't really converge anything and it kind of just stays in this way     
1:06:37     
and not in a sense that there has to be convergence or one magical theory for everything no but more like understanding where things are in     
1:06:44     
the space of of those competing ideas is important so yeah yeah     
1:06:51     
definitely so that's you know that's talking about superum Ai and some of these     
1:06:57     
benchmarks and getting a sense of what you know what when we say model is     
1:07:02     
intelligent it's exhibiting intelligence or I won't even get into sentience yet because that's like one different cattle     
1:07:09     
of fish but like what does that mean and can we compare it with biological     
1:07:15     
intelligence and how would we do that and it's turns out it's not anywhere near as easy is people like to claim so     
1:07:23     
this is an article uh uh Melanie Mitchell in science this is from 2024 so     
1:07:30     
this is pretty new this is from March U this is uh debates on the nature of artificial general intelligence this is     
1:07:37     
I guess another critique but it's sort of just kind of characterizing these different debates and sort of what you     
1:07:44     
deal what are you dealing with when you have an artificial general intelligence I mean is it something that you could     
1:07:50     
compare to human intelligence is it just its own thing is it even General and     
1:07:56     
that's another issue that you know if you develop a technology say to simulate     
1:08:02     
some task and it does really well on that task is it general or is it just kind of simulating that task very well I     
1:08:10     
mean that's that's why one reason why we use benchmarks where you can do many different types of things and see if     
1:08:17     
your model you know does equally as well and you know that mean that maybe one     
1:08:22     
way to kind of characterize this General aspect in general intelligence but again     
1:08:28     
you know this is not something that it's all very loose and it's all very fluid and that's not really doesn't     
1:08:35     
necessarily lead to good science so the term artificial general intelligence has become ubiquitous and     
1:08:42     
current discourse around AI openi states that it's Mission it's a mission     
1:08:47     
statement link is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all Humanity deep Minds company vision     
1:08:54     
of course uh notes that artificial general intelligence has the potential to drive     
1:09:00     
one of the great transformations in history and so this basically says that you know there are all these kind of     
1:09:06     
mentions of artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence being     
1:09:11     
this benefit being this you know transformational thing but you know if we can't Define it then uh you know it's     
1:09:20     
not I don't know if that's what it is um so one could not be blamed for assuming     
1:09:26     
that the meaning of the term AGI or artificial general intelligence is established and agreed upon however the     
1:09:32     
opposite is true what AGI means or whether it means anything coherent at all is hotly debated in the AI community     
1:09:40     
and the meaning and likely consequences of AGI that become more than just an academic     
1:09:46     
dispute you know of course the world biggest tech companies are making decisions based on this but a deep dive     
1:09:53     
into speculations about AGI RS that many a AI practitioners have starkly     
1:09:58     
different views on the nature of intelligence and than do those who study human and animal cognition differences     
1:10:06     
that matter for understanding the present and predicting the likely future so this goes back you know to     
1:10:12     
this idea of early from early AI so the original goal of the AI field was to     
1:10:19     
create machines with general intelligence comparable to that of humans so in 1965 hervert Simon     
1:10:26     
predicted in his book the shape of automation for men in management it's a very 50s to 60s title the shape of     
1:10:34     
automation for men and management um yes and this is like this sounds almost like a counterpart to uh Norbert Weiner's     
1:10:42     
book yeah a little cybernetics information like communication control     
1:10:48     
and the Machine animal yeah yeah Herbert Simon you know     
1:10:53     
we should kind of maybe revisit some of his work in the context of cybernetics he wasn't a cyberneticist but he did do     
1:11:00     
like kind of this management work so he was in management uh studies and social     
1:11:06     
science so it might there might be some relevance there anyways in this book he     
1:11:11     
predicted that machines will be capable within 20 years so 1985 of doing any work that a man could     
1:11:18     
do and again like this is just kind of I guess at the time it's management it's     
1:11:25     
uh of course not just men but they're doing things with auto you know they're automating things in offices they're     
1:11:32     
automating things on the factory floor as well but I think his focus is office work so this is uh you know and of     
1:11:39     
course we've automated office work we've done a lot of that and you know the idea     
1:11:44     
being that you could just automate all of it and that's fine and of course my project management course I talk about I     
1:11:51     
have a whole section on Automation and how you know you know you automate something and you can automate     
1:11:58     
things but what it does is it removes accountability but it also removes like     
1:12:04     
uh the organizational aspect so in other words if you have automation you spend a lot of time with     
1:12:11     
oversight to make sure it fits into the organization fits into the organizational scheme and you end up     
1:12:17     
spending a lot of time doing that as well we're fixing things that it messes up because it's not well integrated into     
1:12:24     
the organization into the human capital de organization     
1:12:30     
anyways so despite this prediction you know I don't know by 1985 that was     
1:12:36     
actually the case you know we started to get computers into the workplace but of course this this is this has been the     
1:12:43     
vision in 1970 in Life Magazine Marvin Minsky was quoted as declaring that in     
1:12:49     
from 3 to 8 years which of course was by 1980 we will have a machine with the     
1:12:55     
general intelligence of an average human being so you know I mean maybe not all     
1:13:01     
of you were alive in 1980 but 1980 we did not have that and we don't have that now we would argue you might argue I     
1:13:09     
mean a machine that will be able to read Shakespeare Rea car play office politics tell a joke     
1:13:16     
have a fight so you know for a cognitive science standpoint that's a pretty provocative statement because reading     
1:13:23     
Shakespeare greasing your car telling a joke and having a fight or or different     
1:13:28     
things there's uh you know procedural memory there's motor control there's uh     
1:13:35     
declarative memory there's um you know emotion     
1:13:40     
there's there are all sorts of cognitive things going on here and you know having     
1:13:46     
a machine that does all those things and maybe that's the lesson here for general intelligence is that you know you're     
1:13:53     
talking about different aspect effect of cognition kind of being able to go between those just like a human brain     
1:13:59     
does so we can do procedural memory we can do episodic memory we can do     
1:14:04     
declarative memory we can do motor control we can do emotional processing     
1:14:10     
all with the same brain basically you know different parts of the brain but of course the idea being is that you know     
1:14:17     
you want to have a machine that I mean it's all of that and so you know that's     
1:14:22     
that's the idea here of General intellig so I heard that there was a comment here     
1:14:28     
in the chat oh it's it's a reference to the the song is this it's a it's a song     
1:14:36     
but it's also like this sort of I think it's a great like cultural reference     
1:14:42     
point it's not that popular but like it's it's a song that's about     
1:14:49     
uh the the the big big hopes maybe it's like early wave of AI hope and     
1:14:56     
technology and it specifically mentions uh especially about the inter International geophysical year okay uh     
1:15:04     
which is like this like kind of like World science fair thing yeah but but basically like the song talks about like     
1:15:10     
transatlantic tunnels and like it basically makes references to Star Wars     
1:15:15     
or Star Trek and how like you know you gotta get this like you can just do everything and and we kind of figured     
1:15:20     
out all our problems and stuff like that um it's always funny to look at the     
1:15:25     
history of oh it's only it's it's all it's always you know 10 to 20 years away     
1:15:31     
while having this you know major breakthroughs and and what does that look like and and so on and then why or     
1:15:37     
why not those are the case um so yeah interesting very interesting very interesting set of     
1:15:44     
Articles all those so yeah so I mean another thing     
1:15:50     
you know think about is that people have in cognitive science at the same time they was this attempt to sort of     
1:15:57     
understand all these different cognitive functions and how the brain does all these things you know simultaneously or     
1:16:03     
with the same basic set of machinery and you know one idea of course were functional modules and so there was a     
1:16:10     
whole like period of cognitive science where they talked about modularity and     
1:16:15     
strong modularity weak modularity and all this basically the idea was that your brain has different modules that do     
1:16:22     
different things and you know then you know how did those evolve how did those     
1:16:27     
how did those function together and you know some people think that the idea of modules are bunk so that's there's a     
1:16:34     
whole debate in cognitive science as there usually is about things but the idea here is that there's this sort of     
1:16:41     
vision of of general intelligence there's you know the measurement of     
1:16:47     
intelligence and psychology but also at the same time you have cognitive science kind of trying to unpack you know the     
1:16:54     
brain from a nitive standpoint and then you have this idea of modularity which of course is and connectionism which is     
1:17:01     
kind of going out at the same time so of course you know none of this really came to pass uh the term AGI was     
1:17:08     
coined in the early 2000s to recapture the orig original lofty aspirations of     
1:17:13     
AI Pioneers seeking A Renewed focus on attempts to study and reproduce intelligence and it as a whole in a     
1:17:21     
domain independent way so again the domains are not important it's the function that     
1:17:28     
allows you to do things in different domains but it's all kind of a centralized thing which of course again     
1:17:34     
you know from a cognitive science standpoint this is pretty naive because I mean you know we we might have a     
1:17:40     
domain independent thing uh but but it's not um it's not you know it's it's     
1:17:47     
tangentially related to some of the things that we're actually you know when we develop a benchmark and we test it on     
1:17:53     
some performance metric um as in the side I was going back over     
1:17:58     
the papers on Al estasis um that we we've covered um you     
1:18:04     
know we talked about the ellises paper for example on alist stasis and uh you know the idea there     
1:18:12     
what was that I wasn't sure which paper you're talking about spine oh yeah so you know     
1:18:20     
they're uh from 2022 was on Al estasis uh but the idea there is that Al estasis     
1:18:27     
is this domain independent mechanism and of course Al estasis is sort of how they     
1:18:33     
propose that there's this term allostasis which is like homeostasis what regulates things in     
1:18:39     
different states um and it does this uh but this is sort of at sort of a     
1:18:46     
physiological level you know not necessarily like things like emotion but     
1:18:51     
like a deeper physiological regulation so it's it's optimizing energy flow and     
1:18:57     
things like that metabolism that that then regulates cognition so it's     
1:19:03     
interesting that in a in AGI in this concept of AGI you're thinking about     
1:19:09     
cognition and a domain independent way they think well there's this domain independence of cognition there's this     
1:19:15     
master regulation of intelligence and in this in this Al estasis literature what     
1:19:20     
they're arguing is that well the brain has a domain independent set of mechanisms but they're energetic they're     
1:19:27     
met metabolic and they're regulated through Al estasis and then the regulation of Al estasis affects     
1:19:34     
cognition by affecting the sort of the conditions under which you learn things where you can recall things so for     
1:19:41     
example if you you're ill you know you may not have the kind of memory you would like or the kind of cognition you     
1:19:47     
would like if you're uh under emotional dress you don't have the kind of C you     
1:19:52     
don't you can't recall certain details about things there are all sorts of things that can affect     
1:19:58     
cognition in a way that's not cognitive so that's a very important thing to     
1:20:03     
remember here is that you know when you're talking about general intelligence you could talk about     
1:20:09     
cognition you could talk about domain General uh cognition or you could be     
1:20:14     
talking about something else that artificial models don't have like a metabolism or a um you know a set of     
1:20:22     
energetic imperatives yes okay uh so yeah then this just kind     
1:20:30     
of goes through AGI and kind of what you know we've learned in this sort of     
1:20:36     
process and what some of the people in large companies are talking about and     
1:20:42     
you know it's so it's very it's still very uh you know General they're gen     
1:20:48     
they speak in generality so Dennis hbus defines AGI as a system that should be able to do pretty much any cognitive     
1:20:55     
tasks that humans can do so that's not really a definition of general intelligence that's just saying that if     
1:21:02     
you're a machine you can do what humans can do okay but that's that doesn't say     
1:21:08     
how that should be structured or how that should be regulated uh in in the system itself     
1:21:14     
open eii describes it as a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable     
1:21:20     
work so we get this economic aspect again which is where we want to replace     
1:21:26     
humans in tasks you want automate offices or whatever and that's not that     
1:21:31     
doesn't necessarily map to um you know the general the the cognitive domain     
1:21:38     
aspect this is just kind of if there's a task that we think is repetitive we can     
1:21:43     
develop a system to do the work but that's not really modeling intelligence     
1:21:49     
per se that's just kind of taking those economic parts of it and and     
1:21:55     
and automating it so this is you know kind of unpacking this idea of general     
1:22:00     
intelligence and intelligence in models and in machines and um talking about     
1:22:07     
super intelligence uh you know and how that's been     
1:22:12     
conceptualized and you know this is such speculative views of AGI and super     
1:22:17     
intelligent by extension differ from views held by people who study biological intelligence especially human     
1:22:24     
C ition whereas cognitive science isn't a rigorous definition of general intelligence or consensus on the extent     
1:22:31     
to which humans of any type of system can have it most cognitive scientists     
1:22:37     
would agree that intelligence is not a quantity that can be measured on a single scale or and arbitrarily dialed     
1:22:44     
up or down but rather a complex integration of general and spe specialized capabilities that are for     
1:22:51     
the most part adaptive in a specific evolutionary niche so what this means is that you can't say     
1:22:57     
for example measure uh you know different benchmarks like if you perform well on spatial     
1:23:03     
cognition tasks or perform well on memory tasks or even perform well on     
1:23:08     
like emotional tasks that those are different things of different types and     
1:23:14     
so you know you might have this underlying regulatory Machinery that that sort of affects that performance     
1:23:21     
but the performance itself they're in different domains and it's hard to compare them all in the     
1:23:27     
same uh at using the same numbers so you'd have to have different indices for these different things and then put them     
1:23:34     
together and say well my AI performs well in this but not well in this and you know so so on and so forth and but     
1:23:42     
also that human or biological brains evolve in a specific evolutionary Niche     
1:23:49     
so human brains are generally uh intelligent because they're responding     
1:23:55     
to this need to be very flexible and produce things like culture and adapt to     
1:24:01     
different environments whereas you know brains in other organisms uh sometimes     
1:24:06     
are very highly specialized to that environment like if you have like say for example a fruit fly grain it's very     
1:24:15     
uh you know it's adapted to performing tests in its environment it's     
1:24:21     
integrating information in a certain way and it has you know has specific types     
1:24:27     
of uh performance for motor control and things like that that are specific to     
1:24:33     
its Niche and it's evolved there and so you know we forget about the     
1:24:38     
evolutionary imperative of a brain how it evolved how it came to be so this is     
1:24:44     
one thing that you you know biological intelligence people study that area they     
1:24:49     
think about it all the time because it's very important and usually you're studying Within that uh context so     
1:24:57     
that's that's an important Point yes uh many who study biological     
1:25:03     
intelligence are also skeptical that so-called cognitive aspects of intelligence can be separated from its     
1:25:08     
other modes and captured in a disembodied machine so this is about embodiment and sort of how that plays     
1:25:16     
into uh this sort of idea of intelligence or domain independent or     
1:25:22     
dependent intelligence and so yeah that it's kind of you know     
1:25:28     
of course embodiment gets glossed over in this discussion and we of course talk about that in the lab a lot so uh that's     
1:25:35     
another aspect of it but um so I'm gonna stop on this for now um and I know     
1:25:42     
Morgan has some things to say well I was just you know just go going over those     
1:25:48     
again and um you know one like the SE are the     
1:25:54     
worst software cases that I've ever heard you know yeah like like you know     
1:26:02     
would we really these are you know they're they're they're they're kind of     
1:26:09     
simplistic and also uh I think Douglas Adams was the first to uh to actually do     
1:26:16     
this right you know because uh you know what he's talking about deep thought you     
1:26:22     
know in terms of like is is the super intelligence going to going to give us     
1:26:28     
what we actually want yeah you know because of course it gave us 42 and yeah     
1:26:36     
it was like well did you actually know what the question     
1:26:42     
was um so I I think Douglas Adams should be given Credit First oh yeah at least     
1:26:48     
in terms of thought experiments anyway yeah I mean this is     
1:26:54     
just kind of like a one person's history of it but yeah well yeah I mean Benjo     
1:27:01     
was there too right you know we would ask him to solve     
1:27:06     
climate change and it would wipe us     
1:27:14     
out I would think we would have a few more software controls on that yeah yeah     
1:27:22     
yeah well anyways yeah food for thought and so Jesse had made made some points     
1:27:28     
here even po Bagel theory is language grounded in emergent properties why why I mentioned that is     
1:27:36     
is not in a sense of oh it's a great Theory but more like it's an interesting interace interface between sort of the     
1:27:45     
view of I guess abstract intelligence or abstract cognitive ability in a sense of     
1:27:53     
s of disembody abstract also as in just like domain unspecific in whatever else     
1:27:58     
versus one of the cool things about the poal theory which is which is like like     
1:28:04     
a clinical you know therapy thing and not not I'm not I'm not making remarks     
1:28:10     
about the scientific nature of it yet although there scientific work there is more um it's grounded in     
1:28:19     
in depending on you know I'm not saying this how the whole field talks about it     
1:28:24     
but but the way I was introduced to it was this explicit     
1:28:30     
um uh this explicit sense it's not about     
1:28:36     
choosing uh it's not about being willing it's about being able like as in if you are in a specific regulatory State you     
1:28:43     
will do not have options to do certain things like could say cognitively or     
1:28:49     
emotionally like your regulatory your regulatory affordances change depending on what state you are in and I was like     
1:28:55     
well that's like yeah I think that's a cool like it's nice to see language talking about that from from a somewhat different standpoint when we talk about     
1:29:02     
like comp intelligence and even like to metab brains and the things we talked about so that was that was sort of that     
1:29:08     
came up there and then um uh so it's and and that's like poly     
1:29:13     
bagle theory is 20 years old at best um and and very you know somewhat Niche     
1:29:21     
even in in sort of that clinical therapy clinical social work type Community     
1:29:28     
um that said my other point was basically uh yes the the uh they keep it     
1:29:35     
alive Factor um and I think that's one of the most I I want to I would love to write something about that someday just     
1:29:41     
to talk about it because I feel like that needs a very clear name and a very     
1:29:47     
clear like you have to like almost like fundamentals to I don't want to say body     
1:29:54     
intelligence but just like even like the dev AI theme or whatever like the sense of understanding not even the sense of     
1:30:02     
it's the way that intelligence is but just differentiating much of the language and     
1:30:08     
literature that's been developed over time hasn't always been aware of or talked about directly in this way of     
1:30:15     
what it means to that biological systems have very different if you're talking to     
1:30:21     
a biology person like oh obviously of course but the people like coming at from this standpoint of intelligence or     
1:30:28     
general intelligence uh you have very mixed you know takes on what what what what is     
1:30:33     
that and and what does that why does that matter and like oh it should be the same anyway this this weird     
1:30:40     
contextual uh ambivalence about it at times um and then my last point was     
1:30:46     
basically not just that which I just cly said but also like measuring or tracking     
1:30:53     
of the factory of you're standing outside you're standing outside of a building and you know what comes out is     
1:30:58     
like a car this great thing but you can't go inside the building you know you can you can you can you can listen     
1:31:04     
you can see you kind of peer in but you can't go and see how it works so you're just you're just sort of standing outside of this sort of Black Box     
1:31:10     
somewhat but just the difference between measuring and tracking these things in a way that's convenient for human beings     
1:31:15     
to do versus how it works and how things are visualized or measurable from the     
1:31:22     
you know The Observers St Point there's all factors that yeah so I mean that's     
1:31:28     
important to think about like this survival imperative we saying like you     
1:31:34     
know we maybe done things in our evolutionary history to keep ourselves     
1:31:39     
alive versus not so if you developed certain cognitive abilities it's to the     
1:31:45     
advantage of the organism so but the problem is is like when you think about my     
1:31:50     
performance um you know do we we don't obvious don't evolve ever improving     
1:31:57     
performance necessarily we evolve a certain type of performance and then that's you know     
1:32:03     
within you know our performance isn't Limitless I guess is the point and maybe     
1:32:09     
you know there there certain you know reasons for that there's some evolutionary constraints that come into     
1:32:14     
play um there's a balance of what we want to devote energy to so like you know you don't evolve you know uh we     
1:32:23     
evolved Lar brain but it wasn't so large that we evolved it to the exclusion of     
1:32:28     
everything else in our bodies basically the idea so you know the way that we     
1:32:33     
kind of think of intelligence is it like a product of adaptation is it a product     
1:32:39     
of constraints in terms of you know the other parts of our brain you know other     
1:32:45     
other cognitive functions is it constraints in terms of like allostatic     
1:32:50     
regulation where we're you know managing an energy but and we can only devote certain amounts     
1:32:56     
of energy to different cognitive functions and then if we translate that     
1:33:01     
into uh the artificial sphere you know first of all we can develop I guess uh     
1:33:08     
things that exceed human benchmarks that would maybe give us some sort of superhuman performance on those     
1:33:14     
things but then could we build a general intelligence which could do other things that would be uh as superum in those     
1:33:23     
other areas is if so why and do we want to simulate human intelligence or do we     
1:33:30     
just kind of want to build things that are like super human in in nature and just kind of exceed Human Performance     
1:33:36     
and so there are a lot of questions there but but characterizing it all is sort of like analogous to biological     
1:33:42     
intelligence is sort of the thing that we want to critique here or think about     
1:33:53     
yeah so this is uh this is good this good discussion um any other comments or     
1:34:02     
questions just I like to see all those articles um and and I'm try to excerpt     
1:34:09     
some things from them yeah this this is I I have visions of trying to     
1:34:18     
basically uh uh um I don't know how to really an     
1:34:26     
easy way to say it which isn't what I actually mean but like almost like make like a playlist that are topically discussion like keep like keeping all     
1:34:33     
the topics of discussion in in like one space um and I know I don't mean like a     
1:34:39     
YouTube playlist I just um I'm think you ways to organize those discussions so we got to scrape the YouTube     
1:34:47     
Pages yeah L lot of like Cool Tools about this     
1:34:53     
now too that looking at oh yeah well I'm I'm pretty sure what's is it Scrappy or     
1:34:59     
something spy I don't know     
1:35:06     
yeah yeah there are a lot of tools that you can like get uh you know take the audio     
1:35:13     
content yeah but I mean we did this off of you know because because we     
1:35:18     
posted I think using Meetup for a long time okay and um so we had we had all     
1:35:26     
this all this like link yeah basically all this link history um meet up and um     
1:35:33     
somebody you know somebody used I I think it's Spacey uh SPAC     
1:35:40     
Cy um industrial strength yeah NLP old school     
1:35:46     
NLP uh uh but but it's just a good way you can point it uh you can point it at     
1:35:52     
you know um kind of subdomain and and tell to grab all the     
1:36:00     
text yeah I'll see if if you can Spacey for for YouTube oh yeah yeah that would     
1:36:06     
be good uh yeah Trevor is see your     
1:36:13     
there yeah you I feel bad because it's you talked about it forever ago but I I did have a few words about the arc     
1:36:19     
challenge because you brought it up okay I actually I've looked at before um I     
1:36:25     
was intrigued by it and um it turns out there's a little bit more um than what     
1:36:30     
appears on the surface so the problem mostly appears to be one of like because     
1:36:37     
people have actually written articles of um how one would theoretically win the AR challenge or do much better than     
1:36:44     
anyone's currently done and it the the creator has basically created this thing     
1:36:51     
of his mind where there aren't um existing tools to really solve the     
1:36:58     
problem so it basically requires the creation of a domain specific language     
1:37:03     
uh that um that he didn't make and basically no one has made it so um once     
1:37:10     
that thing gets created um it would easily create it would permit synthetic     
1:37:16     
data sets to be created and then the challenge should be um solvable very quickly but it's really more of     
1:37:24     
uh there's a lot of Maintenance stuff and like brushing one's teeth that people don't want to do and no one wants     
1:37:30     
to doing so when I hear the arch it's really what I think of is there's     
1:37:36     
basically just a lot of grunt work that nobody's wanted to do um and so I think     
1:37:41     
there's plenty of methods out there um that once it was once you had the action     
1:37:46     
space to find um then you should be able to AI that thing um     
1:37:54     
so yeah I just wanted to add that about the AR oh okay     
1:38:00     
yeah there there was um some recent     
1:38:06     
uh what was that like maybe a month ago Jesse     
1:38:12     
um I think you posted some links there was some     
1:38:20     
um there were some updates on it you     
1:38:27     
yeah on the arc challenge like U I don't remember no um I believe it I     
1:38:37     
just don't remember what got it got it yeah I remember talking about it too I don't know yeah but you know yeah like I     
1:38:47     
seem to remember there were some people in     
1:38:52     
France was was interviewed and maybe it was in De anyway I I'll just have a I'll have a     
1:39:00     
look while all right yeah my impression of a lot of these challenges is that you can win them by     
1:39:07     
like doing very unconventional sorts of solutions where like you know they don't     
1:39:13     
yeah I mean like the the best practices don't always win it's just kind of like whatever wins Whatever Gets you for the     
1:39:20     
finish line so like I think we're talking kull somewhere yeah and a month     
1:39:26     
yeah sorry oh yeah go ahead yeah     
1:39:32     
that's I'll just repost this some new stuff I mean you know again like     
1:39:40     
like he is trying to make it yeah I mean he's not saying that there     
1:39:48     
isn't Machinery that you can build but but he's trying to make it     
1:39:54     
difficult for current machine right oh yeah and and that that that is somehow     
1:40:01     
capturing yeah it's capturing something that that we're missing     
1:40:06     
yeah like would you agree Trevor or you know like is     
1:40:14     
it not not getting it you know something valuable     
1:40:24     
um well I do agree that's what the Creator States the intent of this thing     
1:40:30     
is that I I don't think that um at least it's not obvious to me that     
1:40:38     
um it necessarily encourages new um like Vistas into like     
1:40:45     
intelligence um I only say that perhaps out of pure ignorance but I see how this     
1:40:51     
thing could be solved um if one took the time to actually create the actions that     
1:40:58     
um the Creator hasn't defined and so um the trick to me then is could you     
1:41:06     
come up with something that could then figure out or do what the humans doing in creating those actions um but that     
1:41:13     
doesn't seem to be the emphasis of the Creator but yeah     
1:41:21     
yeah so I just I put the a link to the new     
1:41:27     
videos uh which which channel Dev Dev AI okay yeah so we talked about that during     
1:41:32     
when we had that discussion about physical Computing I think last year where you know there all sort there are     
1:41:38     
different kinds of computers one could build that would be maybe more analogous to human the human brain or biological     
1:41:44     
brains that we don't have in the vono and architecture of our computers that we have now so we could build benchmarks     
1:41:52     
for those kinds of machines or build a machine like that and test and you know get to something that's maybe more     
1:41:59     
domain general or you know there different things you can do there but you need kind of a new architecture     
1:42:06     
doesn't exist and then of course the history of AI has a lot of instances of     
1:42:11     
people inventing languages that are specific to like build you know like uh     
1:42:16     
you know things that characterize semantics or things that characterize you know they're not using     
1:42:22     
just out of the box they're building these highly specialized languages that do things that are encode a lot of the     
1:42:28     
intelligence and so yeah it's uh interesting stuff uh let's see Dev AI     
1:42:35     
is here this is the channel so we have uh the art prize this is the YouTube     
1:42:42     
video and so you didn't yeah you didn't have the that's that's just the the the     
1:42:48     
channel itself yeah okay it's various various things various small     
1:42:54     
okay yeah that they posted like a month ago oh well yeah     
1:43:00     
yeah uh yeah that's that's uh oh here's an article from uh the New York Times in     
1:43:06     
1958 electronic brain teaches itself so this is uh back you know this is again     
1:43:13     
the sort of making hardwon right well this is the perceptron but this is kind     
1:43:18     
of like talking about the perceptron in 1958 so the language I use is really     
1:43:24     
interesting so the Navy last week demonstrated the embryo of an electronic computer named the perceptron which of     
1:43:30     
course we all know from uh the the sort of Classics but the time it was brand     
1:43:36     
new which when completed in about a year is expected to be the first non- living mechanism to perceive recognize and     
1:43:43     
identify its surroundings without training or control so this is uh sort     
1:43:49     
of this is the vision for the Reon Navy officers demonstrating a     
1:43:54     
preliminary form of the device in Washington said they hesitated to call it a machine because it was so much like     
1:44:00     
a human being without life so this is the rosenblat work Frank rosenblatt's     
1:44:07     
lab uh he conducted the demonstration the machine he said would be the first electronic device to think     
1:44:13     
as the human brain like humans the perceptron would make mistakes at first but it were wiser as a gain's     
1:44:20     
experience so uh the first perceptron cost about 10,00 $100,000 in 1958 buy     
1:44:28     
which will have about 1,000 Electric Association cells receiving electrical     
1:44:34     
impulses from an I like scanning device with 400 photo cells so this is much     
1:44:39     
different even from the stuff that we're doing now and much at a much smaller scale but it was expensive and it was     
1:44:47     
thought to be sort of an analogy to the entire human brain so uh uh in principle so they had this     
1:44:55     
section on self- reproduction in principle Dr rosenblat said it would be possible to build perceptrons that could     
1:45:02     
reproduce themselves on an assembly line and which would be conscious of their existence and then you know this is the     
1:45:09     
idea that uh uh talking about present mechanical brains literally teaches itself to     
1:45:17     
recognize objects the first time it encounters them so again this is this stuff about where you know you're trying     
1:45:24     
to learn things from nothing from no experience or from no training you have     
1:45:31     
not just generalize but like recognize novel things so even back then that's what they were trying to do     
1:45:39     
so yeah and Grace Lindsay's book um models of the mind is is uh does a great     
1:45:49     
you know review of that that time period yeah and the work yeah yeah work before     
1:45:56     
that the work after that yeah I love the embryo of a brain oh yeah     
1:46:05     
well okay well yeah so I don't know if we had any more conversation or comments     
1:46:11     
on that before we move     
1:46:17     
on now I I did now I didn't forget about biological brains and I've got something     
1:46:22     
here from ewi that is about and we've talked about the fly connectome and     
1:46:28     
we've talked about some of these small connectomes so in cgans of course we have a completely defined connectome     
1:46:35     
which are these uh you know small nervous systems that have a small enough number of neurons and a small enough     
1:46:42     
number of connections between them that we can characterize them by through     
1:46:47     
things like uh you know Imaging Technologies and map them and and give them names and actually build models     
1:46:55     
that you can visualize them so um this article is um it kind of goes through     
1:47:03     
some of the small connectomes and then it gets into some of the the sort of contemporary work on fruitfly connecton     
1:47:09     
or drop connecton and U so this is I think in a     
1:47:15     
previous meeting it could have been last year we talked about Michael winding at all and their study on the nerve cord     
1:47:23     
of the SE of the dropa so it's this the basically the nerve cord of dropa and     
1:47:30     
this Associated uh neurons so it's not the entire brain but it's the nerve cord     
1:47:37     
and then there's some other studies on other parts of the fly brain such as the sensory systems and some of the motor     
1:47:43     
systems and so if you put those connectomes together you get pretty close to the entire nervous system of a     
1:47:49     
fruit fly which doesn't sound impressive but it's actually quite a few neurons um     
1:47:55     
but we do have these smaller connectomes like celegans which is 302 neurons and some anoid which have like     
1:48:03     
less than 100 neurons so this article kind of walks through conecto these     
1:48:09     
small connectomes these complete connectomes that we have or near complete connectomes and what those look     
1:48:15     
like and so one of the things we're trying to do in open worm is to you know simulate whole connectomes very small     
1:48:22     
connects but things that generate behaviors things that are have sensory inputs and things that produce a sensor     
1:48:30     
and M intelligence and so this is kind of going through kind of     
1:48:36     
some of these uh uh studies that have sort of proposed these connectomes so     
1:48:42     
you know one of the things they do in in proposing a connectome is they they collect high density Imaging data you     
1:48:50     
know microscopy or you know um other types of Imaging and they annotate the     
1:48:56     
images by looking for the neurons identifying the neurons usually through some sort of stain and then looking for     
1:49:03     
the connections sometimes there the electrical connections of Gap Junctions     
1:49:08     
between cells sometimes there are synaptic connections and looking for those in you know they're able to label     
1:49:16     
those in the images and identify them and then put together uh like a database     
1:49:22     
of the cell identities and then the connections and that's your connectum so     
1:49:29     
you know uh producing connectomes is technically and computationally challenging most of the existing ones     
1:49:36     
are of small invertebrates with limited number of neurons the first generation of connectomes included the nemat     
1:49:43     
celegans which has about 300 neurons the cirt cion intestinalis which is     
1:49:48     
interesting model organism and the anoid uh plattin nurus uh de de and so this is     
1:49:58     
this anoid is the one that has like less than 100 neurons the C squirt CN     
1:50:03     
intestinalis has uh complete uh connecting but also has a     
1:50:09     
really nice uh developmental data set associated with it and then of course     
1:50:16     
celegans and that has 302 neurons and so the cooked paper and the white paper are     
1:50:22     
the seans connectomes the white at all from 1986 was the first connectone for     
1:50:28     
seans the cook paper from 2019 provides connectum for both the male and the     
1:50:34     
hermaphrodite SE elegant so provides some there there's some differences in in the number of neurons and the     
1:50:40     
connectivity there uh Verso which is uh this pops up     
1:50:48     
this is for the uh analid larae so this is a whole animal connectum and     
1:50:55     
cell type complement of the three segmented anoid larae and then Ryan is     
1:51:01     
the one where they have these uh conecto of The tadp larva of CA intestinalis so     
1:51:08     
CA in test analis goes through a number of larel stages and this is the Ted so some interesting data sets there     
1:51:16     
but when we get into dropa we have a number of subc connectomes you could call them so     
1:51:23     
uh veropa has a larger scale of of neurons so they have thousands of of     
1:51:30     
neurons so um and you know we want to be able to characterize every neuron so we     
1:51:37     
have to take this in parts and so uh the first insect connectomes are of the     
1:51:43     
fruit fly drosoph melanogaster they include both the brain the brain of both the larvae and the adult as well as a     
1:51:49     
partial reconstruction of the female ventral nerve cor or BNC this is uh analogous to the     
1:51:56     
vertebrate spinal cord that integrates sensory information and coordinates motor output uh now in E uh card jefferis Berg     
1:52:05     
and colleagues um report having generated the First full connecto of the ventral     
1:52:11     
nerve cord of an adult male fruit fly this is takamura 2024 we haven't talked     
1:52:17     
about this paper but this is a connectum of the maer southla ventral nerve cord     
1:52:23     
uh so this you know they're making progress in dropa in these different parts of the connectome um so and and     
1:52:31     
really any connectome is any set of Connections in a nervous system so we have connectomes for human brains but     
1:52:38     
they're largely like based on fmri so they're not based on neurons themselves     
1:52:43     
they're based on like regions of Interest or boxels and so but this these     
1:52:49     
connectomes are based on each neuron so they include like for example this takar 2024     
1:52:56     
includes over 23,000 neurons connected by more than 10 million pre sinapsis 74     
1:53:02     
million post synapses and a total length of 44 meters of neuronal ARB so that's a     
1:53:08     
pretty decent Siz connectum to look at and have identified um at the cellular level two     
1:53:15     
companion studies also to be published in elif supplement this resource with additional biological insights so Carden     
1:53:23     
colleagues describe how the pathways linking grein centers to motor neurons are organized while jeffereson     
1:53:30     
colleagues cataloged and grip the neurons and the VNC connectome based on cell type so these are different ways to     
1:53:37     
look at the connecto uh you know looking at brain centers and the organizational motor     
1:53:43     
neurons and then looking at the VNC connecto is on cell type which is of course another can of worms that we     
1:53:50     
won't get into but cell type basically they use different markers to determine its function and its its uh typology so     
1:54:00     
this is something that is useful especially when you get to that number of cells what are the specific cell     
1:54:06     
types and you know uh without really having a good molecular characterization     
1:54:13     
of cell type you know what what are they doing in connector that's their     
1:54:18     
role uh so yeah uh as well as the connector itself uh this group takamura at all     
1:54:26     
which is the paper here uh described a robust pipeline built to generate the     
1:54:31     
VNC connectone of a 5-day old adult male fly so this is where they have to build     
1:54:37     
this this informatics pipeline to like integrate these data and put it into a framework so they can actually extract     
1:54:43     
the connecto uh they require combining and adapting state-of-the-art methodologies     
1:54:49     
necessary to prepare and then image the two tissue using electron microscopy as well as the approaches     
1:54:56     
used to align and assemble the resulting images that gener are comprehensive map of the structure so this is kind of what     
1:55:03     
they're doing they take the vental nerve cord they Tak uh you know focal planes     
1:55:09     
of the th cord they do segmentation of the images they find the cells they find     
1:55:16     
the connections here synaptic connections between this blue cell and this orange cell it's see that it's     
1:55:23     
present at different focal planes so they can image different you know its sort of position but its geometry     
1:55:30     
finding the synapses and then establishing a connection between the two cells then they have this neuronal     
1:55:37     
circuitry that they worked out then they can identify cell types and that's how     
1:55:44     
how they do this and that's all you know that's a lot of work so you know     
1:55:49     
generating these connectomes they generate this data set that other people can use and find uh you know test     
1:55:58     
different hypotheses ask different questions of the data um and so     
1:56:04     
yeah uh using the resulting data set Xiang had all examined how descending     
1:56:09     
neurons are organized into Pathways within the DNC so they've actually taken this data and looked at the different     
1:56:15     
Pathways in the vental nerve board these cells are crucial for movement as they Rel information from the brain to the     
1:56:22     
motor neurons that can activate muscles so computational analyses highlighted 37 distinct neuronal     
1:56:29     
communities they play complimentary roles in controlling movements so this is really getting into the sort of     
1:56:35     
systems level of neural control so you can do experiments and you can say you     
1:56:41     
know you can look at say a stain or like some uh study or you can make General     
1:56:47     
statements about the expression of different genes and different parts of the uh the brain in terms of the     
1:56:54     
structure of the VNC but now you can map this to specific cells you know how     
1:56:59     
those cells are connected you have a very detailed model of how that uh that     
1:57:06     
connectome is operating so this is and of course you know it's not just about     
1:57:11     
finding sort of the path through the connectome the distinct cells that are involved but you have these different     
1:57:18     
aspects of connectivity such as looping connections where you know there's feedback and you     
1:57:25     
get this enhancement of the activity of certain cells so it's not just this path     
1:57:31     
of cells and this additivity you know there are these feedback mechanisms that are     
1:57:36     
actually uh sort of essential to the operation of motor     
1:57:43     
control so this is uh this paper kind of goes on a little bit more about how you     
1:57:48     
know people can use connectomes and how this is a major advance in our understanding of brains     
1:57:55     
especially Beyond these very small connectomes and then they talk about comparative conomics which is where you can go     
1:58:02     
between organisms so you can go between like fruit flies and maybe some other uh     
1:58:08     
insect maybe like bees if you had that connectome and look at differences in     
1:58:13     
Behavior look at differences in structure and make statements about those     
1:58:22     
so let me a comment oh flywi AI That's one of the groups is doing a lot of work     
1:58:28     
with the connect in your yeah yeah I mean as I understand it     
1:58:34     
they're they're trying to to colate all the the work of other labs to you know     
1:58:43     
bring it into you know to produce something kind of like a like a resource like gallon Institute yeah     
1:58:52     
yeah so you know this that go ahead well that was the first stuff that I saw     
1:58:59     
from I mean it's LED out of Princeton but like there was you know this um I     
1:59:06     
think it was big paper um the pi was from Berkeley okay um you know like like     
1:59:15     
showing doing modeling on that Flywire     
1:59:20     
connectum simulation on that and and pulling out sort of     
1:59:26     
like I think some old factory function yeah it was cool I think Shu     
1:59:32     
was the first author like sh sh [Music]     
1:59:37     
IU yeah it was it was cool stuff I mean this this was like the people at the     
1:59:44     
foresight meeting who you know it was suggestive to them that they could     
1:59:52     
they could recover function from solely from conect tonics     
2:00:00     
oh which I I I I I feel is um Beyond ambitious     
2:00:09     
yeah what's what's the what's the play way this yeah well that's very ambitious     
2:00:16     
unrealistic yeah     
2:00:22     
I you know it's great paper though and um yeah I don't know if Trevor had     
2:00:28     
something you want to say sorry I did I was just listening I just turn my cam like on that's     
2:00:36     
all okay yeah so that's good stuff and then uh I think the last thing we'll end     
2:00:41     
on is this these two papers and this is uh you know kind of talking about     
2:00:47     
behavioral stuff but it's separated from connectomes or from AI and it's these     
2:00:53     
two papers that are really interesting and I term this category behavioral freedom and it's an     
2:01:00     
interesting set of papers kind of get hit this idea uh and we'll see what it is here so     
2:01:06     
this paper is from biosystems um this the paper is called the physics of the urge to have     
2:01:13     
freedom this is kind of an odd titled Adrien ban does a lot of stuff with uh     
2:01:20     
he he's a mechanical engine ER does this has this idea called constructal Theory     
2:01:26     
where he's looking at like different structures in their sort of their energetic efficiency and so this is uh     
2:01:33     
well sounds like a paper where they're talking about free will but we'll see what he talks about here um so this is a     
2:01:42     
an interesting way to kind of summarize Behavior as from a physics standpoint um     
2:01:48     
so and the abstract reads Freedom safety and ease of movement are innate human urges attributed to     
2:01:54     
conscience along with many other preferences such as attractiveness economy and life so this is like kind of     
2:02:02     
a way to characterize like uh Behavior but not really linking it to the brain as well as much but just kind of this     
2:02:09     
idea of like what you know what we do in terms of our um Behavior so Freedom     
2:02:18     
safety and ease of movement and I think where he's going with this is that there's this imperative to move there's     
2:02:25     
motility uh there's you know sort of finding a place where you can survive so     
2:02:30     
the survivability we talked about earlier and then Freedom being like not you know being encumbered so it's very     
2:02:39     
sort of philosophical terms here um this article addresses the physics basis of     
2:02:46     
the innate urge to have freedom so it is kind of like maybe like free will but he's going to go from humans then to     
2:02:54     
animals and sort of you know you can think of this in terms of cells as well so you know you have uh cellular     
2:03:01     
motility you have animal movement those are all kind of you know this imperative to move of course we evolve movement     
2:03:08     
maybe in part to escape predation things like that so um it unveils the     
2:03:14     
connection between animal freedom and the universal constructal and this is this constructal Theory see the     
2:03:21     
universal tendency towards easier movement and greater access in all evolutionary systems throughout nature     
2:03:27     
animate and inan the demonstration is made with a model uh of lack of freedom in animal M     
2:03:36     
so this is where he kind of talks about this model a man who walks his dog on a leash so this is an interesting sort of     
2:03:43     
model system for this or toy model uh when two animals are coerced to     
2:03:48     
move at the same speed their combined effort or the SP power is greater than     
2:03:54     
when they move freely and independently so imagine you know a human and a dog a     
2:03:59     
human is walking a dog on a leash the dog is like you know kind of wandering     
2:04:05     
around the human is of course trying to guide the dog along um and of course the human can     
2:04:11     
also wander the idea is that you know they're in trained to each other so there's this lack of freedom and     
2:04:17     
movement when two animals are coerced to move at the same speed and I don't know coersion is the right term but basically     
2:04:24     
when they're untrained with each other they're constrained by each other's movement their combined effort or the     
2:04:29     
spent power so that means like how much energy they're expending on their movement is greater than when they move     
2:04:36     
freely and independently so if a dog is moving independently they're spending less energy than when they're in trained     
2:04:43     
to a human and vice versa when the speed of the couple is dictated by the big body or the person     
2:04:50     
the big one walks freely the small one must run so this is where you know you     
2:04:55     
have human walking maybe faster than the dog and there's this like an anatomical     
2:05:02     
constraint to movement so when the uh when I take a stride if the dog is     
2:05:08     
smaller than me they have to run to catch up um now I I we have big dogs in     
2:05:14     
this house so this is maybe not a good analogy but whatever uh let's just assume a very small dog here relativ to     
2:05:21     
the human stride um participants in organized movement life and Society are     
2:05:27     
not equal all participants move with less effort when they are not coerced to move the same way so the implications of     
2:05:34     
this part of physics or nature are numerous and help unify the animal realm with the design of an an evolution of     
2:05:41     
human society so this is kind of getting into this sort of constructal theory I what a     
2:05:48     
reason I like this paper or I wanted to highlight it is because it's really kind of talking about the physics of movement     
2:05:56     
and thinking about like those kind of relationships and how that guides     
2:06:01     
behavior and how that guides some other things so think about this in terms of the physics and in terms of like complex     
2:06:09     
systems and movement and how that movement is being generated and they don't talk about a brain here but of     
2:06:15     
course the nervous system is generating this it's actually kind of interesting     
2:06:20     
this model the human is walking a dog on a weish reminds me kind of of some of     
2:06:26     
the things that they're doing with um uh     
2:06:31     
synergetics uh especially some of the stuff that uh J Kelo has done with     
2:06:36     
synergetics looking at different coupled systems and we've talked about uh JS     
2:06:42     
Kelo synergetics um in in the cognition Futures group I I think I gave a short     
2:06:49     
presentation on it there once uh like a year or so ago and so they know they're     
2:06:55     
looking at these kind of coupled systems in trained systems and so this also     
2:07:01     
talks about you know sort of the output of muscles which are controlled by     
2:07:06     
energetics and the brain and sort of the constraints on those kind of systems so     
2:07:12     
you know he talks about the physics here talks about some of these aspects of     
2:07:18     
it's is a theory theoretical paper and then getting into sort of this philosophy of human nature     
2:07:25     
urges and uh you know some other things here so it's an interesting paper um but     
2:07:34     
hold that aside for now and the other paper has to do with um something called     
2:07:40     
aggregate void Behavior so if you're not familiar with voids voids are um sort of simulations     
2:07:49     
of birds and so so the original boids platform was where you have a bunch of     
2:07:55     
uh computational agents and they're put into a environment and they all exhibit these     
2:08:02     
Collective behaviors each boid has a set of rules that it follows and a set of     
2:08:08     
neighbors and you have this you know this this parallel set of behaviors by this parallel set of agents and they     
2:08:16     
behave like it turns out that they can replicate the behavior of word flops just by having these individual vo     
2:08:23     
agents all following the same set of rules and then in just interacting with their neighbors and having this parallel     
2:08:30     
system of of agents that are like you know basically behaving in uh concer so     
2:08:39     
that's what they mean by aggregate void Behavior so this is where you can simulate you know Collective behaviors     
2:08:46     
just by simulating the physics of interaction you know don't get too too     
2:08:51     
close to your neighbor don't get too far apart from your neighbor match the speed of your neighbor and so forth so there's     
2:08:57     
this phys again the set of physics that govern these relationships between agents in the first case it was the uh     
2:09:06     
person and the dog being coupled by a leash in this case it's these void     
2:09:12     
agents being coupled by rules that a you know uh here are the the conditions of     
2:09:18     
your interactions now this this aggregate boid Behavior AIDS an artificial     
2:09:24     
autopoetic organization so autopoetic organization is a type of complex     
2:09:29     
systems view called autop poesis uh where you know you basically it's trying to model this sort of uh you     
2:09:37     
know lifelike Behavior this lifelike uh regulation of systems and so you know     
2:09:44     
they get into this uh idea of voids and they kind of get into some of     
2:09:49     
these so this is also from biosystem so um you know they kind of think about     
2:09:56     
this same problem but recast in terms of autop Poes so um let me I won't start at the     
2:10:04     
beginning of the abstract I'll start down here where it's a a systems level characterization that is and referred to     
2:10:11     
as a general pattern of minimal life is autop polies so this is defining sort of     
2:10:17     
this minimal type of life and you know the kind of conditions you need to     
2:10:22     
regulate that so they're using this framework of autopolis and in the previous paper they used something     
2:10:28     
called constructal Theory so they're using different kind of theoretical bases for this same set of interactions     
2:10:35     
uh but autop police is basically describes a living system and describes the minimum conditions for that so     
2:10:42     
autopolis includes production maintenance and replacement of required parts for setting up and maintaining an     
2:10:50     
internal environment with self or other separation and there's a lot of there     
2:10:55     
are a lot of words here but basically it's how do you maintain a living system or maybe better yet is how do you     
2:11:03     
maintain a self-contained dynamical system that doesn't need any external uh     
2:11:09     
input so this is where you know this is where they use autop poesis um the seminal concept of an     
2:11:17     
autopolis instantiated in Life as we know it but my also be instantiated in different Medias this is when they get     
2:11:24     
into this these void simulations so um and so other     
2:11:29     
researchers have argued life is more than autop poesis and that it is a co-emergent property of autop poesis and     
2:11:36     
cognition so this is where we get into these void simulations where you know you have these physical interactions of     
2:11:42     
agents and you can describe it as autopoetic you can also describe it as this sort of constructal theory which is     
2:11:50     
you know looking at the structural aspects of a system and looking at its energy minimization or you can look at it as a     
2:11:57     
form of cognition where you have you know cognitive functions or intelligence that's that's maintaining     
2:12:04     
these relationships uh life produces many emergent properties such as a synchronization and patterns as seen in     
2:12:11     
flocks and herds so you know this is you see this in a number of animal species     
2:12:17     
where they form these behavioral collectives flocks herds schools and they're just basically     
2:12:24     
organisms interacting with each other you know following Simple Rules maybe     
2:12:29     
you know uh follow my neighbor or don't get too close to my neighbor or don't get too far away from my neighbor when     
2:12:36     
you have that happening and Parable you get these uh structures that are you     
2:12:41     
know large scale Collective emerging structures such as flocks or herds or     
2:12:47     
schools and so that's the description of these structures uh but it's something that     
2:12:54     
isn't you know kind of put together by a master plan it's something that just emerges from     
2:13:00     
interactions the mechanics of the synchrony displayed in flocks and herd animals has been extracted by Craig     
2:13:06     
Reynold so Craig Reynolds was the computer scientist who originally ran these blade     
2:13:12     
simulations um and this is of course considered a generative model because it     
2:13:17     
generates a lot of different solutions for a simple set of interactions so when you run the simulation over and over     
2:13:24     
again you can get different types of configurations of these types of uh you     
2:13:29     
know Collective systems but they they are all basically the same type of     
2:13:35     
thing uh with these Concepts in mind we address the following research question     
2:13:40     
how can the synchronous Maneuvers and aggregate behavior of voids contribute to the constitute of subsystems in     
2:13:46     
realizing an autoptic system and such a system exhibit minimal     
2:13:51     
cognition and so they get into this whole uh attribute of autopolis as an explanatory framework     
2:13:59     
for these uh Collective behavioral structures um and thinking about this in     
2:14:04     
terms of minimal cognition and the intelligence of the these types of uh     
2:14:11     
structures so this is you know we have two two papers here we have one that's     
2:14:16     
sort of claiming that you know if we look at these kind of simple systems that that are basically Behavioral     
2:14:23     
Systems with physical constraints we can get you know we have this sort of larger scale set of     
2:14:29     
structures that emerge they can be explained using these types of uh     
2:14:35     
Universal theories um and in this case it's constructal Theory so you can see that     
2:14:42     
there's a lot of there are a lot of equations in this paper where they kind of model the physics of this     
2:14:48     
interaction walking interaction the coupling U of the two agents and you     
2:14:55     
know really gets into the a high amount of mathematical detail here where     
2:15:00     
there's like these kind of parsing out the effects of the efforts of both agents and how those are coupled and how     
2:15:08     
they're efficient energetically then we have this other paper where they're looking at these     
2:15:13     
void systems where it's again a collective where there're couped agents     
2:15:19     
and he's using a different theoretical framework namely autopolis which is this uh you know the     
2:15:26     
sort of emergent properties thing that describes sort of a self-contained system that doesn't need external inputs     
2:15:33     
so this is something that again you know describes these kind of structures that we see in     
2:15:39     
nature and you can simulate them there these physical constraints between the     
2:15:45     
agents and you know it's a different explanatory framework I don't think there's a lot of mathematics here     
2:15:52     
they're you know different like conceptual models they have some mathematics in here kind of describes uh     
2:15:59     
you know some of the aspects of the of the collective structures such as you know velocity changes and cohesion there     
2:16:06     
there are parameters you can measure in these as well but it's not as mathematically uh     
2:16:12     
voluminous uh but you know this is this is another theory so I want to just go     
2:16:18     
over those um I think that's a I just wanted to see if I could actually     
2:16:24     
uh sort of Stitch those two papers together but it's I think it has a lot of things to do with the sort of the     
2:16:30     
physics of of behavior and intelligence and that sort of     
2:16:35     
thing certainly certainly coming off of um you know this year's aife meeting     
2:16:42     
like those are yeah C certainly the boyss would be very in the in the theme     
2:16:51     
and uh well like yeah yeah he's got he's got     
2:16:57     
a GitHub link there and and YouTube video of some     
2:17:03     
animations in in terms of the second paper okay take care Jesse um and uh     
2:17:13     
uh yeah so the the the first paper seems to have     
2:17:20     
you know a real focus on um on synonyms yeah I     
2:17:28     
know how how how these discussions change when you use different words     
2:17:34     
right yeah there's a lot of a lot of emotional content that comes with those words yeah     
2:17:41     
potentially and but but the math the math seems to     
2:17:46     
be very focused on like you said like you know you see in planetary Dynamics     
2:17:53     
as well as you know other other physics other physics work um     
2:18:03     
and yeah yeah I mean it um so I I'm not     
2:18:09     
sure what the you know we didn't didn't quite go through the whole the paper so     
2:18:14     
in the first paper I don't know what his what his kind of objective was at the end in terms of     
2:18:22     
demonstrating I think you use the word efficiency yeah there was an efficiency     
2:18:27     
to the to the kind of relationship between the two bodies yeah so you know     
2:18:34     
there's this whole aspect of like energetic efficiency and like a lot of     
2:18:39     
times we'll describe physical systems in terms of like minimizing entropy or being maximally efficient so that's what     
2:18:47     
basically constructal theory is about and so you know you have this behavioral system where you're minimizing sort of     
2:18:54     
you know maximizing your energetic efficiency and then that leads to like these behaviors that are yeah you know     
2:19:01     
and so yeah yeah yeah sure sure there was something that you were     
2:19:08     
talking about earlier um I think in terms of the the economics of     
2:19:16     
behavior um that that it reminded me of one that um one of the talks Levan had     
2:19:24     
this week you know one of the talks he posted on his you know Lev's what is it     
2:19:29     
called like academic content YouTube channel yeah yeah which I think is just a funny funny name um     
2:19:37     
uh he had somebody focused on that um I I think an economist he he had an     
2:19:45     
economist talking about yeah how how their work uh     
2:19:51     
is is can be can be considered part of you know his you know what is     
2:19:57     
it tame um oh M Minds everywhere I     
2:20:02     
forget what the ta uh technological something yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but     
2:20:11     
also it kind of reminded me of um what was the the the kind of Robotics Animal     
2:20:19     
Behavior book and the mid 90s from like McFarland and um oh     
2:20:26     
yeah it's like yeah we talked about this before but I can't remember the name     
2:20:32     
yeah but but they they they also talked I mean about how economics kind of comes     
2:20:39     
into planning and behavior yes yes yeah yeah     
2:20:45     
and there you know there's a whole field called psychonomics where they do this sort of thing uh oh really yeah it's     
2:20:52     
there's a psychonomic society and they kind of like the basis for cognitive science like a lot of connection between     
2:20:59     
cognitive science and like these kind of uh you know I guess you could think of     
2:21:04     
it as maximal efficiency models uh you I mean is it similar or certainly I     
2:21:11     
think of it as like that you     
2:21:16     
know so so much wouldn't work without like inductive biases and things like that right and and those those are you     
2:21:25     
know can one way of of seeing those is is kind of like as an efficiency     
2:21:30     
mechanism or certainly as a you know this this is how you deal with the the huge amount of data and the kind of     
2:21:36     
drawing the inferences from them to to be actionable is yeah     
2:21:44     
yeah okay so that was that a similar time frame I mean was that like late 50s     
2:21:51     
60s uh well I mean I think a lot of that yeah was coming out of that period but I     
2:21:57     
don't know I think you know like there's a lot of stuff um um you know I think the whole basis     
2:22:05     
of cognitive science really kind of came out of or at least one of the the aims of cognitive science was to um you know     
2:22:12     
replicate what they saw in economics which was you could have this highly predictable social science you could use     
2:22:18     
mathematics to characterize it you could get like you know uh and then there you know there's     
2:22:25     
a lot of other work in in cognitive science that kind of maps the economics or there's overlap so it's really     
2:22:32     
interesting sure I mean are you talking about like the C kind of stuff     
2:22:37     
or kind of broad macroeconomic the well kman was doing like you know all     
2:22:45     
this you know I would call it behavioral psychology but oh     
2:22:51     
with ey tracking I mean well he was doing that kind of pupilometry right so     
2:22:57     
he was giving people cognitive tasks and then you know using the pupilometry to     
2:23:02     
show workload levels and and kind of you know kind of breaking points of people     
2:23:09     
in terms of when when cognition was going wrong but yeah it helped reflect     
2:23:17     
what you know what the mechanisms were you know oh yeah Yeah well yeah that I think that's what they kind of mean by     
2:23:23     
psychonomics that kind of work okay yeah it's confusing like models yeah okay how     
2:23:30     
do you spell that word yeah oh um what was that how do you spell that word if you     
2:23:37     
could put it in oh yeah psych it's like psycho and then nomic     
2:23:43     
like like that yeah there you go yeah it's a just just Port man     
2:23:50     
psychology and ecomics I guess yeah but yeah it's a i' never thought about the     
2:23:58     
the atmology I guess yeah I mean it's an approach I mean you know then then of     
2:24:03     
course you know you have physics which is the physics of behavior which is like just saying that behavior is conforms to     
2:24:11     
physical laws you can use you know that there's universality and this is something in complexity Theory which is     
2:24:17     
the assumption that you can use you know things like power laws and uh Network     
2:24:22     
Theory to describe any range of systems and they don't have to be like specific to like any brain it could be like     
2:24:30     
humans animals uh Power grids whatever and they all follow basically the same     
2:24:35     
laws because when things interact there are certain things that happen certain constraints and then end up apply     
2:24:42     
Universal so I mean that's if you I mean that's an assumption I don't know some     
2:24:48     
people have said that that's that's very Michael Le too right I mean     
2:24:53     
in terms of you can find those things and and Josh bongard had um I forget if     
2:25:02     
I don't think it was his work but it was like maybe one of his students again for aif had you know physical systems that     
2:25:09     
were Learning Systems oh yeah yeah I saw some of that like the was like a     
2:25:15     
chemical they have like chemical systems that are like they use them to model uh     
2:25:21     
emerging intelligence or something I have to that paper out in this case it     
2:25:26     
was it was mechanical okay or it seemed it seemed you know again it was kind of     
2:25:31     
like mass action right rights yeah but but with     
2:25:37     
locality okay yeah yeah yeah and um uh I'll I'll try and I'll TR try and drop a     
2:25:44     
video in I I put the video that um the Boyds guy had in in brenberg vehicles     
2:25:51     
okay yeah yeah but um the well the the other the other thing     
2:25:58     
that came to mind you know it's not not directly related to flocking but just um     
2:26:04     
this guy Edwin de Jammer in Bristol had a an interesting paper just about um     
2:26:12     
Birds what do you call it um um Birds U     
2:26:17     
migration yeah so you know a really     
2:26:24     
simple mechanism and and was you know and like again this is a guy who I know     
2:26:31     
from I think Pi D this he's got a pi     
2:26:38     
itracking software package he's experimental psychologist but he did     
2:26:43     
this paper I think it was during the pandemic and he first published it an     
2:26:48     
archive as just like I came up with this because I'm trapped at     
2:26:53     
home but I just saw just saw it got published in some you know birds or you     
2:27:01     
know ethology yeah yeah you uh but again just     
2:27:08     
you you know similar though in the sense of like     
2:27:13     
using using some very simple physical mechanism and getting out     
2:27:21     
these behaviors that seems you know intelligent right um and and and     
2:27:29     
efficient that was that was I think the other the other thing that was important in terms of the the problem that the     
2:27:35     
birds were solving uh um that that was you know out that guy     
2:27:45     
too but anyway I know it's it's um yeah yeah it's 9:30 here I also see people     
2:27:53     
behind me right so Trevor did you have anything     
2:27:58     
to add or um I mean I'm sure you immediately     
2:28:05     
see the connection as well in the first paper um it reminded me very much of     
2:28:11     
Carl friston's ideas about like life and movement so yeah yeah yeah sure     
2:28:21     
that's about all free energy principle active inference kind of stuff exactly yeah     
2:28:28     
yeah yeah no good point yeah yeah yeah yeah and yeah we'll probably     
2:28:34     
revisit this I I gu I I just kind of put together something I want to see how     
2:28:39     
that was uh we could get out of it but yeah we might revisit this     
2:28:44     
later especially maybe free energy principle type things to she definitely     
2:28:50     
definitely do a a or see if anybody else did a kind of recap of aife 2024 oh yeah     
2:28:58     
yeah maybe you know in terms of just yeah what and was gecko overlapping with     
2:29:04     
that yeah yeah yeah you know so just see you know like yeah highlights from it     
2:29:11     
maybe certainly I saw people dropping videos and like that yeah good     
2:29:18     
stuff okay well thanks for attending and uh we'll keep in touch and and slack and     
2:29:25     
uh see you next week take care take care thanks

## NOTES
So many different directions for sustainability -- Turing Way (Alan Turing institute). 

* what am I supposed to accomplish?

* part in white paper on how to create metrics.


Software sustainability institute. Research software engineers.

* project software that goes down the rabbit hole.

* strategies for expansion (learn from/repurpose).


Ben Cotton: released from RedHat, Flock to Fedora conference.

* 10 people, 5 answers on open-source sustainability (XR).

* UCSC Genomics -- organoid cultures, interact with multiple techniques or cultures modeled.

* EonXR projects -- instructional, dissection of XR objects.

Stanford organogenesis course, Johns Hopkins practices (toxicology).

* burnout -- is the open-source project your "work" project?


NumFocus -- lead byb one person, very small groups.

* "news" vs. "project" updates. What is going on in space if its relevant.

* expert writing. 

* Demo or Die, Demo or Deploy. Crunch time, meetings as a way to search for solutions are a bad fallback.

* show current state of the space. Sketch some work out as a possible solution. Justification for things in the moment.


Alumni: Stefan, Ankit Gupta, Rishabh, who else?

* VR for Distributed Research (VRDR). Display room for labs (anatomy, model organisms, Morris Water Maze).

* data collection, model organism exploration. Navmesh: /pii/s2352711021000881

* VR builds for learning -- navigation, anatomy, organisms.

* Navmesh, Morris H2O Maze. Assets in terms of the human body --> biomechanical simulations.

* https://neurorobotics.net/ (virtual rat, gazebo as simulated world). Psychology experiments.


Plug in agents, experiments. Mouse in MWM, takes a lot of training.

* neurorobotics --> realistic connectomes into virtual creatures vs. neural architectures.

* "compare" vs. "development".

* evolutionary history in a connectome. Bongard -- ACM paper on evolutionary robotics course.

* Model Merging -- Huggingface conversation. Foundation models +. Automate creation of foundation models (EAs).

* LORA -- fune-tuning LLMs. Research assistant, using LLMs. Literature guidance (Science Augmentation).


David Ha --> SakanaAI -- Richard Watson -- connections between evolution and learning.

* evolutionary computation and teleology. What are you controlling?

* developmental connectomes -- random matrix theory, random weights and what can be done computationally.

* Piagetian -- what are the best ways to present information for (childhood) learning?


Algebra project. Learn how to better present mathematics. Scientific/computational thinking (children as little scientists).

hi 
Jes says:
i may be delayed in start or limited in time there today. 
Jes says:
listening

Adama
Adama says:
Hi, i can't talk bezcuse i'm at my student job right now but im listening ! 
Adama says:
If we are selected, how will we share our codes ? Via github for example ? 
Adama says:
Ok thank you

No questions from my side, thank you for the insights !

Jes says:
sorry I was away for some of the t hings earlier.

Adama
Adama says:
Is there others person who are interested in vr subjects ? Is it possible to make some collab with other students if it is the case and if we are interested in the same thing ? 
9:26

Jes
Jes says:
but to that point i've actually considered there just being one big news channel really, and maybe some kind of tagging for upates, ratehrt han slotting the updates elsewhere. But TBD 
Jes says:
Adama, the short answer is yes - I'm not sure if you are familiar with our summer cohort option in general and its relation to the GSoC projects themselves. It's not unusual for a group of people to form around the GSoC projects and continue them through the summer or fall.

Thank you jes üòÉ

Jes
Jes says:
for later

I have a few stories I may share later on if there's time, from this week. One about 'demo or die' / prof dev, one about mentoring / research / training ; I met with a colleague this week who was visting an accepted students day at camrbdige/boston area university .

vrushali says:
Hi everyone , hope all of you guys are doing great.  i would like to give few min presentation for gsoc vr project if we have time.

Jes says:
Adama did you mean collaboratio in general, or specifically a 'collab' notebook 
9:48

Adama
Adama says:
I would be glad to see your presentation  vrushali üòÉ) 
Adama says:
Jes i meant collaboration in general , especially multidisciplinary collaboration

Jes ( says:
are you currently in our main slack  workspace also, adama? there are a few user accounts with that name there, so I wasn't sure 
9:58

Adama
Adama says:
Yes i am, i joined the vr channel,  the gsoc channel and some others one

I didn't get to see almost anything this year, I am glad to see things were recorded

Amanda Nelson says:
evolutionary computation is something we could focus on for a few cybrg meetings. i have to go - talk to you soon! 
10:55

I have to go me too very soon, thank you for this meeting ! See you next week
